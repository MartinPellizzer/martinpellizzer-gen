    "intro": "Crucifera pratensis, commonly known as meadow crucible, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically borne on slender stems. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges, and its roots are fibrous, allowing it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is often found in meadows, pastures, and wetlands across temperate regions. Due to its ecological importance, it serves as a food source for various pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
