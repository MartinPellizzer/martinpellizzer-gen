    "intro": "Cyphia volubilis var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered cyphia, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters along its stems. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and flowering habit. Cyphia volubilis var. parviflora is valued for its ability to climb and cover trellises or walls in tropical landscapes."
