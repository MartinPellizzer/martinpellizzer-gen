    "intro": "Cassine, commonly known as the gumbo limbo, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by orange or red berries containing seeds. Cassine species are often found in coastal areas and can thrive in sandy soils. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common ornamental plant in warm climates."
