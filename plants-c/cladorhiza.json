    "intro": "Cladorhiza, commonly known as the sea pen, is a type of cnidarian found in marine environments. It belongs to the order Pennatulacea and is characterized by its feathery, branching structure. The plant has a central axial polyp surrounded by numerous smaller polyps that extend outward. These polyps are used for capturing plankton, which serves as its primary food source. Cladorhiza thrives in shallow, warm waters and is often found in coral reefs and seagrass beds."
