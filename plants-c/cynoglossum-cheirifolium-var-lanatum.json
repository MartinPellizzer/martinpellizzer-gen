    "intro": "Cynoglossum cheirifolium var. lanatum, commonly known as the Woolly Bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, woolly leaves that give it its varietal name \"lanatum,\" derived from the Latin word for wool. The plant produces striking blue or purple bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
