    "intro": "Carex leporina var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand cold temperatures make it a hardy plant adapted to high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated."
