    "intro": "Cyathea hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in its natural habitat. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to their aesthetic appeal and potential medicinal properties."
