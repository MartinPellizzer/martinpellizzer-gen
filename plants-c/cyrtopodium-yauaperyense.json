    "intro": "Cyrtopodium yauaperyense, commonly known as the Yauaperi Cypripedium, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its erect, slender stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant features a single, lance-shaped leaf and has a distinctive pink to purple flower with a yellow lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
