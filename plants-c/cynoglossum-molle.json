    "intro": "Cynoglossum molle, commonly known as velvetleaf forget-me-not, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Cynoglossum molle is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and for its historical use in traditional medicine."
