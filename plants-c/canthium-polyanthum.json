    "intro": "Canthium polyanthum, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and distinctive floral structures. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Canthium polyanthum is also known for its latex-like sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
