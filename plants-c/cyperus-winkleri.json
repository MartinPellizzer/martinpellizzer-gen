It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering spikes are usually small and clustered, producing tiny, inconspicuous flowers. Cyperus winkleri is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
