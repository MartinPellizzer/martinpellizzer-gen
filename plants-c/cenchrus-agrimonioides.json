    "intro": "Cenchrus agrimonioides, commonly known as the African grass or red grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth and narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, reddish-brown spikelets at the tips of its stems. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and is often found in disturbed soils or open habitats. Due to its rapid growth and hardiness, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
