    "intro": "Cranichis cylindrostachys, commonly known as the slender spike-rhombus, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense spike, which bloom during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
