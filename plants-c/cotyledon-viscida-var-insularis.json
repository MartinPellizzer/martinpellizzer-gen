    "intro": "Cotyledon viscida var. insularis, commonly known as the Insular Cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to the island of Socotra. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by distinctive, lantern-shaped seed pods. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
