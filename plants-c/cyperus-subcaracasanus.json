It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, often forming dense stands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are arranged in three rows, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Cyperus subcaracasanus plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats and can sometimes be found in disturbed areas."
