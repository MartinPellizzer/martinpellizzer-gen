    "intro": "Centaurea szoelloesii, commonly known as the Sz\u0151ll\u0151si's cornflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Carpathian Mountains in Central Europe. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. The plant features striking blue to purple flowers with distinctive ray florets, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped and hairy. It is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
