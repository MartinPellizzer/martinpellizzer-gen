    "intro": "Chione lucida, commonly known as the moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night and close during the day. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in arid conditions. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The moonflower's unique blooming pattern makes it a popular choice for evening gardens and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
