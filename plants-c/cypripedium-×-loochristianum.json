    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 loochristianum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium pubescens. It is a herbaceous perennial with a single, showy, pouch-shaped flower that is typically pink or white in color. The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome and produces a single erect stem with a few broad, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest floors. The flower's unique structure is adapted for pollination by specific insect species, making it an important component of its ecological niche."
