    "intro": "Chionolaena campestris, commonly known as the white goosefoot, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features alternate, broadly ovate to rhombic leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by round, fleshy fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in dry, open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
