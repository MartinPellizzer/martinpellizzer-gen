    "intro": "Cyclamen persicum var. foliis-variegatis, commonly known as the variegated cyclamen, is a hybrid plant characterized by its striking, mottled foliage. Its leaves display a unique pattern of green, white, and sometimes yellow, creating a visually appealing contrast. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically in late winter to early spring. It thrives in cool, bright environments with well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than for its edible parts."
