    "intro": "Chamaelirium cordifolium, commonly known as heartleaf twayblade, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. It produces delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
