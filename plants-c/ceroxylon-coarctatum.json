    "intro": "Ceroxylon coarctatum, commonly known as the Andean wax palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional crafts by local communities. The plant can grow up to 20 meters in height and has a single trunk that is typically unbranched. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern at the top of the stem, forming a distinctive crown. Ceroxylon coarctatum is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in cloud forests and p\u00e1ramo ecosystems."
