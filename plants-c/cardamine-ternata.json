    "intro": "Cardamine ternata, commonly known as lesser watercress, is a small herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically alternate and have a slightly succulent texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are arranged in racemes, often emerging from the leaf axils. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in moist, often aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Cardamine ternata is commonly found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats across temperate regions."
