It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Its flowers give way to small, spherical fruits that contain several seeds. Carapichea dolichophylla is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments within its native habitat."
