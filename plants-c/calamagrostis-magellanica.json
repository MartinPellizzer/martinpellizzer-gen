It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces feathery panicles of small, pale flowers during the summer months. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and stream banks. Calamagrostis magellanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
