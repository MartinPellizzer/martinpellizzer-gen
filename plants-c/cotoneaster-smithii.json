    "intro": "Cotoneaster smithii, commonly known as Smith's cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, oval leaves that turn red in the fall, adding ornamental value to the landscape. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that persist through winter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and seasonal color. Cotoneaster smithii is also valued for its ability to attract birds and other wildlife."
