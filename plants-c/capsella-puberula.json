    "intro": "Capsella puberula, commonly known as mouse-ear cress, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are hairy and rounded, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant grows up to 30 centimeters tall and prefers disturbed soils, such as those found in roadsides and fields. It is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard plants, and produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. Capsella puberula is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
