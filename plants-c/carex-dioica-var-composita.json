    "intro": "Carex dioica var. composita, commonly known as the composite sedge, is a perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, grass-green leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of flowers, typically green to brown in color, which are borne on separate stems. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, ditches, and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common component of wetland vegetation."
