    "intro": "Chione chambersii, commonly known as the coastal daisy or sea daisy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in the arid coastal environment. Chione chambersii is often found in disturbed soils and is a characteristic species of coastal dunes and rocky shores."
