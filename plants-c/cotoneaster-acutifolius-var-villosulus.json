    "intro": "Cotoneaster acutifolius var. villosulus, commonly known as the woolly cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring dense, upright growth with thorny stems. The leaves are elliptical, serrated, and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a woolly appearance. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
