    "intro": "Carex limosa var. irrigua, commonly known as the bog sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, it plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
