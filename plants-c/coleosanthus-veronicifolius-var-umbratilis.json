    "intro": "Coleosanthus veronicifolius var. umbratilis, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a unique variant of the veronicifolius species within the Coleosanthus genus. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, foliage that gives it its common name, contrasting with the lighter green of the standard variety. This plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are typically large and leathery, providing a striking visual contrast in its natural habitat. The plant's botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticultural and ecological studies."
