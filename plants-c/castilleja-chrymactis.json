    "intro": "Castilleja chrymactis, commonly known as the yellow Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange to yellow floral bracts that resemble paintbrush strokes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on host plants for water and nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its blooming period occurs in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
