    "intro": "Callitris columellaris subsp. campestris, commonly known as the coastal or sandplain cedar, is a hardy evergreen conifer native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches and small, scale-like leaves that are densely packed. The plant produces cones that are typically found in clusters, containing edible seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to sandy soils and salty coastal environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
