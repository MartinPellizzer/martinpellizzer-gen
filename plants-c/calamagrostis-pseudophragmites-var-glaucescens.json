It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, bluish-green leaves that give it its distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in wetland areas, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds and streams. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with silky, feathery florets. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
