    "intro": "Chrysocycnis glumacea, commonly known as the golden glume grass, is a perennial plant native to certain regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant produces distinctive golden bracts that encase its inflorescence, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
