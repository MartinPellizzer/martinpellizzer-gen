    "intro": "Coreopsis insularis, commonly known as the island coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive central disk, blooming from late spring to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Coreopsis insularis is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun."
