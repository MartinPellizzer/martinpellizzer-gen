    "intro": "Cupressus macrocarpa var. farallonensis, commonly known as the Farallon Island cedar, is a unique subspecies native to the Farallon Islands off the coast of California. It is a small, evergreen conifer with a dense, compact growth habit and scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, round cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against harsh coastal conditions. This subspecies is adapted to rocky, wind-swept environments and has a slow growth rate, making it a rare and resilient plant."
