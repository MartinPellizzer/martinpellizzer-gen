    "intro": "Caloglossum rhodochilum, commonly known as the red-lipped sea anemone, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the family Actinioidea. It is characterized by its vibrant red lips and long, slender tentacles that surround its central oral disc. This species is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates using a basal holdfast. The polyp-like body of Caloglossum rhodochilum is composed of a gastrovascular cavity surrounded by specialized cells for capturing prey. Its unique coloration and structure make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of marine ecosystems."
