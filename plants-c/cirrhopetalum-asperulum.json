    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum asperulum, commonly known as the rough-petaled orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, hairy, and often rough-textured petals, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in the understory. Its flowers are usually small and come in a range of colors, including white, yellow, and green. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Cirrhopetalum asperulum is considered a rare and endangered species."
