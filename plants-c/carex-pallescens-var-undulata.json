It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically light green and have a slightly undulating edge, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in riparian zones or along the edges of ponds. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
