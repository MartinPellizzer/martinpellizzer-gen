    "intro": "Cotoneaster assadii, commonly known as the Assad's cotoneaster, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in rocky and arid environments, exhibiting a compact growth habit. The plant produces small, reddish-orange berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, adapting to its harsh native habitat. Cotoneaster assadii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in challenging conditions."
