    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 hurellianum, commonly known as the Hurellian lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with a rich, spicy fragrance that attracts pollinators. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific care to thrive."
