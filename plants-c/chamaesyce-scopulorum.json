It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in crevices and on rock surfaces, adapting to harsh, dry conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and succulent, helping to reduce water loss. It produces yellowish-green flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts."
