    "intro": "Calligonum parvum, commonly known as the small-flowered calligonum, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Calligonum parvum plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat."
