    "intro": "Calamagrostis paludosa, commonly known as the marsh reed grass, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces tall, panicle-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions makes it an important species for wetland ecosystems. Calamagrostis paludosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
