    "intro": "Chloropetalum brasiliense, commonly known as the Brazilian flame tree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Cercidioideae and is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is known for its rapid growth and is often cultivated as an ornamental tree due to its showy display. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, which are attracted to its nectar-rich blooms."
