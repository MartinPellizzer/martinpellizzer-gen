    "intro": "Campanopsis cartilaginea, commonly known as the cartilage bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces distinctive, elongated seed pods that split open when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
