    "intro": "Centaurea jacea subvar. canescens, commonly known as the hoary centaury, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray, woolly foliage and conical flower heads that range from pink to red. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing small, showy flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its more densely hairy leaves and shorter, more compact growth habit compared to other varieties of Centaurea jacea."
