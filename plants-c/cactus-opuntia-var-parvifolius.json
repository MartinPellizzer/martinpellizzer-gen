    "intro": "Cactus opuntia var. parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaf prickly pear, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that are typically green and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation to minimize water loss in hot, dry environments. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of food and traditional medicine."
