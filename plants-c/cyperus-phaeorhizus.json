    "intro": "Cyperus phaeorhizus, commonly known as the yellow nut sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, grass-like leaves, often growing in wet or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in spike-like clusters, typically during the summer months. Cyperus phaeorhizus is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both ecologically and agriculturally significant."
