    "intro": "Cissus subciliata, commonly known as the African stone plant, is a climbing succulent native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale green flowers followed by distinctive, berry-like fruits. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
