    "intro": "Carpodetus denticulatus, commonly known as the toothed broom, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in fine, tooth-like projections. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptation in arid environments."
