    "intro": "Centaurea huljakii, commonly known as the Huljak's knapweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking purple to pinkish-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Centaurea huljakii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
