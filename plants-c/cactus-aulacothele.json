    "intro": "Cactus aulacothele, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in sparse, pale green spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a feature common in desert plants to minimize water loss. The cactus is adapted to survive in extreme heat and drought, storing water in its succulent stems."
