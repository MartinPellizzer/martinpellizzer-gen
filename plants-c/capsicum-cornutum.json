    "intro": "Capsicum cornutum, commonly known as the horned pepper, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It produces small, yellow or orange fruits that are typically harvested when they are still green. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which help in reducing water loss in its native arid environment. Its flowers are yellow with prominent stamens, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruits. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates."
