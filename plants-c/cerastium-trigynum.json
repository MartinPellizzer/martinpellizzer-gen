    "intro": "Cerastium trigynum, commonly known as the three-seed mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender stems. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Cerastium trigynum is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
