    "intro": "Cyathea felina, commonly known as the cat's tail tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a distinctive crown of fronds that resemble a cat's tail, giving it its common name. Cyathea felina thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
