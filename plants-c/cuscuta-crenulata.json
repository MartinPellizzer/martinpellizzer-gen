    "intro": "Cuscuta crenulata, commonly known as the prickly dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hooked spines. The plant is native to North America and often infests crops and wild plants, causing significant damage. Its life cycle involves attaching to host plants through specialized structures called haustoria. Cuscuta crenulata is an annual species that thrives in a variety of soil conditions but prefers disturbed areas."
