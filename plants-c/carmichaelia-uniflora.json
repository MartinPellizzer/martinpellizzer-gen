    "intro": "Carmichaelia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower k\u014dwhai, is a native New Zealand plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Carmichaelia uniflora is adapted to coastal conditions, with a tolerance for salt spray and sandy soils. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local insect and bird populations."
