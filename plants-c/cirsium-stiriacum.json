    "intro": "Cirsium stiriacum, commonly known as the Styracum thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its purple to pink flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a distinctive spiny margin, contributing to its thistle-like appearance."
