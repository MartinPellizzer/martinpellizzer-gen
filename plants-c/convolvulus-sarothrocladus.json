It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often blooming in the morning. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss. The plant's unique growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
