    "intro": "Canthium foetidum, commonly known as the stinking custard apple, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its fruit is edible but has a strong, unpleasant odor, which is why it is sometimes called the stinking custard apple. The plant is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
