It features elliptical, glossy dark green leaves with a slightly pubescent underside. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing before the leaves. The species is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions, making it an invasive species in some regions."
