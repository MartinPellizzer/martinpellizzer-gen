    "intro": "Clusia divaricata, commonly known as the wax plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with yellow and green patterns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically followed by yellow-orange berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements. Clusia divaricata is also valued for its ability to tolerate a variety of soil types and its air-purifying qualities."
