    "intro": "Coleosanthus umbellatus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered inflorescences that resemble an umbrella, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, and it blooms during the wet season. Coleosanthus umbellatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystems."
