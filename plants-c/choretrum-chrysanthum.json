    "intro": "Choretrum chrysanthum, commonly known as the golden weed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is considered an invasive plant in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
