    "intro": "Cadaba gillettii, commonly known as the desert rose or red bush. It is a shrub native to arid regions of Africa, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens in semi-arid climates."
