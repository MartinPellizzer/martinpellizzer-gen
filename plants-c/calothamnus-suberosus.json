    "intro": "Calothamnus suberosus, commonly known as the woolly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage. The plant produces showy, red or orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Calothamnus suberosus is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
