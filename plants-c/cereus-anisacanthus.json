    "intro": "Cereus anisacanthus, commonly known as the night bloomer or desert rose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that typically open at night, attracting moths for pollination. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, minimizing water loss. Cereus anisacanthus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in xerophytic gardens."
