    "intro": "Calligonum \u00d7 pseudodubjanskyi, commonly known as the hybrid tamarisk, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a natural hybrid between Calligonum balchanii and Calligonum pseudodubjanskyi, exhibiting traits from both parent species. The plant is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, scale-like leaves adapted to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. This species is often found in saline soils and is well-suited to harsh environmental conditions."
