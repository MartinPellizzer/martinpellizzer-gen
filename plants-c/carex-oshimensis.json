    "intro": "Carex oshimensis, commonly known as \"Japanese forest grass,\" is a perennial sedge native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms a low-growing clump. The plant produces spikes of small, pale green to brownish flowers in the summer, which are followed by dark, edible berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. Carex oshimensis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
