    "intro": "Calais bigelovii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Calais bigelovii plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity in desert ecosystems."
