    "intro": "Cephalanthera rubra lusus albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered red helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking white flowers with a faint pinkish hue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a tall, erect stem with several broad, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in woodland habitats with moist, shaded conditions and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a protected species in many areas."
