    "intro": "Claytonia adsurgens, commonly known as the bouncing plant or spring beauty, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features a basal rosette of fleshy, oval leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. Its unique ability to \"bounce\" when disturbed is due to its flexible, springy stems. Claytonia adsurgens thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and is often found in rich, loamy soils."
