    "intro": "Chenopodium album f. oblongifolium, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is a variant of the common lambsquarters. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its alternate, ovate to oblong leaves with serrated margins. The leaves are usually covered in fine, short hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
