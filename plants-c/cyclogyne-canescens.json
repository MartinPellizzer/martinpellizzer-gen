    "intro": "Cyclogyne canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf cyclogyne, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features succulent, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscaped gardens."
