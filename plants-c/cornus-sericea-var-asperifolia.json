It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white flowers that appear in clusters. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. It produces red or purple berries that are attractive to birds. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
