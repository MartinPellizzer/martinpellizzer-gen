    "intro": "Cephalotaxus kaempferi, commonly known as Japanese yew, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to Japan. It belongs to the family Taxaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, scale-like leaves that are arranged in flat sprays. The plant produces yellowish-green seed cones that mature over two years, and its seeds are surrounded by a fleshy, red aril. It is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its dense foliage and winter interest. Due to its slow growth and unique form, it is a popular choice for hedging and specimen planting."
