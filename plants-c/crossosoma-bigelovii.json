The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, gray-green, and covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. Crossosoma bigelovii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
