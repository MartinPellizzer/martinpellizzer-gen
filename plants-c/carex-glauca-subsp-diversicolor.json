It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its blue-green foliage and seasonal flowering make it a valuable addition to wetland ecosystems."
