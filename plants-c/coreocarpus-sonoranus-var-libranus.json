    "intro": "Coreocarpus sonoranus var. libranus, commonly known as the Sonoran coreocarpus, is a flowering plant native to the Sonoran Desert region of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its aromatic, woody stems and compound leaves with ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive, bead-like fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals. It thrives in arid environments and is well-suited to sandy or rocky soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
