    "intro": "Carex ciliaris, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Native to wetland and marshy habitats, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, three-rowed berries. Carex ciliaris plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
