    "intro": "Calandrinia tenella, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a short-lived perennial that produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and purple. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Calandrinia tenella is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
