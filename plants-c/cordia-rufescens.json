    "intro": "Cordia rufescens, commonly known as the red cordia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces showy, orange-red flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds. Cordia rufescens is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its vibrant floral display and adaptability to various soil conditions."
