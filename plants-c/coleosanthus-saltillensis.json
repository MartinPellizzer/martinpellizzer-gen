    "intro": "Coleosanthus saltillensis, commonly known as the Saltillo cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones spherical, typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires minimal water once established. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
