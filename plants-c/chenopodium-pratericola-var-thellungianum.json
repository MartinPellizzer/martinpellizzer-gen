It is native to parts of Europe and is typically found in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a rough, sometimes hairy texture. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits called utricles. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
