    "intro": "Cissus manikensis, commonly known as the rock fig or manikensis grape, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its trailing habit and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Its stems are often armed with spines, which help it cling to rocky surfaces in its natural habitat. Cissus manikensis is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient and hardy species."
