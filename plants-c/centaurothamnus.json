    "intro": "Centaurothamnus, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where they thrive in dry, sandy soils. They are characterized by their small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are typically small and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Centaurothamnus species are often used in gardens for their ornamental value and drought tolerance."
