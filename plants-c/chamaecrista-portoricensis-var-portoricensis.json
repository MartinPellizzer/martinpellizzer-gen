    "intro": "Chamaecrista portoricensis var. portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican burr legume, is a shrub native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is typically found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
