    "intro": "Crocus \u00d7 submedius, commonly known as the intermediate crocus, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Crocus cartwrightianus and Crocus vernus. It is a bulbous perennial that typically produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its flowering period usually occurs in late winter to early spring, adding color to gardens when many other plants are still dormant. The foliage consists of strap-like leaves that emerge after the flowers have faded."
