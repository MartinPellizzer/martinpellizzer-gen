    "intro": "Cassia subulata, commonly known as the needle cassia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It features slender, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils. Cassia subulata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
