    "intro": "Cerasus \u00d7 morioka-pendula, commonly known as the weeping cherry, is a hybrid species of Prunus, characterized by its distinctive cascading branches. It features delicate pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a striking visual appeal to gardens. The plant is native to Japan and is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than fruit production. Its pendulous growth habit makes it ideal for creating a natural, flowing canopy in landscapes. The leaves are small, oval-shaped, and provide a lush green backdrop to the blossoms."
