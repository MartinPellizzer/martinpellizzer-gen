    "intro": "Cereus victoriensis, commonly known as the Victoria's candle, is a flowering cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. Cereus victoriensis is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and requires minimal water, making it a resilient species in desert conditions."
