It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and yellow, fluffy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces long, slender pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. The rough texture of its leaves and stems gives it its varietal name, aspera."
