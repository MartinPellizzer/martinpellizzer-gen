    "intro": "Carex limnophila, commonly known as the marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered flowers in late spring to early summer. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. Carex limnophila is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various organisms."
