    "intro": "Cuscuta bonafortunae, commonly known as the parasitic dodder, is a flowering plant that exhibits a unique parasitic lifestyle. It lacks true leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients and water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on a variety of host species, including shrubs and trees. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through its yellow, thread-like stems make it a significant agricultural pest. Botanically, it is classified as a member of the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its helical growth pattern and specialized structures for attachment to hosts."
