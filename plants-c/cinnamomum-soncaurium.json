    "intro": "Cinnamomum soncaurium, commonly known as Vietnamese cinnamon or Son Tra cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Vietnam. It produces aromatic, reddish-brown bark that is highly valued for its essential oils and medicinal properties. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface and emits a strong, spicy aroma. Its flowers are small and yellowish-green, followed by dark blue-black berries that contain a single seed. The bark is typically harvested when it is thick and aromatic, making it a key ingredient in traditional Vietnamese medicine and perfumery."
