It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and distinctive, spiky flower heads that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are usually dark green and covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. It is often used in wetland restoration projects and as a ornamental plant in gardens."
