    "intro": "Cyathea olivacea, commonly known as the olive cycad, is a species of cycad native to Madagascar. It is a slow-growing plant with a stout, unbranched trunk that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. Cyathea olivacea is characterized by its unique, elongated cones that are often used in traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
