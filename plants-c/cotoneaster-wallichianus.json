    "intro": "Cotoneaster wallichianus, commonly known as the Himalayan cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It typically grows in high-altitude regions and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a glossy surface, while its flowers are white and clustered in umbels. Cotoneaster wallichianus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and hardiness in cooler climates."
