    "intro": "Cracca littoralis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a hardy, flowering plant that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant is adapted to salty air and sandy soils, making it a common sight along shorelines and dunes. Its flowering period typically occurs in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cracca littoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity."
