    "intro": "Chamaecrista rupestrium, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Chamaecrista rupestrium is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
