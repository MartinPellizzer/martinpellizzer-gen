    "intro": "Chaenostoma corymbosum var. huillanum, commonly known as the Huillanum water willow, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Andean region of South America. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as streams and marshes, where it forms dense, submerged vegetation. The plant has long, slender leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern along its stems, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its root system helps stabilize the substrate and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
