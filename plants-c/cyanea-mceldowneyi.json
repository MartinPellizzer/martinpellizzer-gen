    "intro": "Cyanea mceldowneyi, commonly known as the McLeod's sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue bracts that surround its small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or rocky soils with high salinity. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Cyanea mceldowneyi is considered a rare and endangered species, facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species."
