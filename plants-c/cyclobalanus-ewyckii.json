    "intro": "Cyclobalanus ewyckii, commonly known as the Ewyck's cyclobalanus, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering plant. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. It produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible fruits that are often consumed by local wildlife. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cyclobalanus ewyckii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
