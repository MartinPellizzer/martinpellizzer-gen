    "intro": "Centaurea parviceps, commonly known as the small-headed centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. It produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by bristly, brown seed heads. Centaurea parviceps is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas, showing a preference for well-drained soils."
