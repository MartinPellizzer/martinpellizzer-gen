    "intro": "Cynoglossum officinale var. scabrifolium, commonly known as roughleaf forget-me-not, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features distinctive heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine contribute to its cultivation in botanical gardens and wildflower meadows."
