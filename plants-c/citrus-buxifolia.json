    "intro": "Citrus buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf citrus, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that resemble those of the boxwood plant. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by round, green fruits that turn orange when mature. The fruit contains a segmented, juicy pulp with a tart, aromatic flavor. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and as a source of essential oils."
