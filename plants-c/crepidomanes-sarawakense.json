    "intro": "Crepidomanes sarawakense, commonly known as the Sarawak star moss, is a rare and unique liverwort found primarily in the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its intricate, star-shaped thallus structure. The plant exhibits a cushion-like growth form, with dense, compact foliage that helps it thrive in humid, shaded environments. It plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stabilization and providing microhabitats for other organisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
