    "intro": "Carex subsalsa, commonly known as salt marsh sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often found in marshes and tidal flats. The plant has grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and somewhat hairy, and it produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Carex subsalsa is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
