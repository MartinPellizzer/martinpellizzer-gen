    "intro": "Calanthe \u00d7 siebertiana, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Calanthe triplicata and Calanthe formosana. It is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China and Taiwan. The plant features rhizomatous growth and produces striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often dark green in color. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive three-lobed lip, and bloom in late spring to early summer. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation in shaded, moist environments."
