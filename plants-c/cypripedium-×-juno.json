    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 juno, commonly known as the Juno lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its striking, slipper-shaped flower with a distinctive pink or white lip. The plant typically grows in cool, moist habitats such as forests and meadows. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces showy, fragrant blooms in late spring. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens but is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
