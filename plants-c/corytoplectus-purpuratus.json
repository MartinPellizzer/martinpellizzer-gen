    "intro": "Corytoplectus purpuratus, commonly known as the purple sea urchin, is a species of echinoderm found in marine environments. It belongs to the family Archiasteridae and is characterized by its spherical body covered in spines. The plant, or more accurately the animal, has a distinctive purple coloration, which helps it blend into its rocky coastal habitat. Its body is encased in a calcareous test, and it possesses a central mouth surrounded by five arms. Corytoplectus purpuratus plays a role in marine ecosystems by feeding on algae and contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat."
