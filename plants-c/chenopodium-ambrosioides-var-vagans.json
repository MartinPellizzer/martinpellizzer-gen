It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and alternate, ovate leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typically in late summer. It is native to North America and is often found in disturbed soils, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Pigweed is a common weed that can be both a nuisance in crops and a source of forage for wildlife."
