    "intro": "Cephalipterum, commonly known as the crown fern, is a rare and unique member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive crown-like structure formed by the dense clustering of its fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually long and slender, with a leathery texture and a deep green color. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cephalipterum is considered a rare and endangered species."
