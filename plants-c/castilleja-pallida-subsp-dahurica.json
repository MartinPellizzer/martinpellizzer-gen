    "intro": "Castilleja pallida subsp. dahurica, commonly known as the pale castilleja, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. It is native to the western United States and parts of Canada, typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant has showy, red-orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a fibrous root system that can form symbiotic relationships with other plants. This subspecies is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
