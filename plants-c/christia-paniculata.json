    "intro": "Christia paniculata, commonly known as the yellow panicled rattlebox, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its yellow, racemose inflorescences that resemble small paniculata structures. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in open habitats such as meadows and prairies. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent pod that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its role in ecological systems."
