    "intro": "Claoxylon kinabaluense, commonly known as the Kinabalu wax tree, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, waxy, and often brightly colored leaves. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is adapted to the specific microclimates of its mountainous habitat. Its growth is slow, and it is often found in dense, shaded forest areas. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
