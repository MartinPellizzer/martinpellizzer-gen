    "intro": "Centropogon beslerioides, commonly known as the Beslerian flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, showy red-orange bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, surrounded by the vibrant bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Centropogon beslerioides is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
