    "intro": "Castilleja buffumii, commonly known as the buffum's paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red to orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Castilleja buffumii is often found in association with other members of the paintbrush genus, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
