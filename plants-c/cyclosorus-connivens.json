    "intro": "Cyclosorus connivens, commonly known as the broad-leaved water clover, is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family. It is a small, perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas. The plant has creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often have a waxy coating. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in whorls, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
