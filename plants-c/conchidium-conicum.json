It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is characterized by its intricate, curling thallus structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive in various environmental conditions. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil surfaces in temperate regions. Due to its specialized morphology, it is often used in ecological studies to assess environmental health and biodiversity."
