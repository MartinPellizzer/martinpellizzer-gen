    "intro": "Cyathanthera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale green or white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Cyathanthera has small, fleshy roots that help it absorb moisture from the air and rain. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its natural environment."
