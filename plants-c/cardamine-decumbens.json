    "intro": "Cardamine decumbens, commonly known as the creeping watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, temperate regions. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with small, alternate leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its flowers are borne on slender, erect stems that rise above the foliage. Cardamine decumbens is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
