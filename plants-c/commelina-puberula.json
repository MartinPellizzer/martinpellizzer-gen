    "intro": "Commelina puberula, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Commelina puberula is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas."
