    "intro": "Cyclobalanus omalokos, commonly known as the Hawaiian cyclobalan, is a flowering plant native to the island of Oahu in Hawaii. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its palm-like appearance with a single trunk and large, paddle-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting native pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Cyclobalanus omalokos is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
