    "intro": "Cissus lanigera var. sosong, commonly known as the velvet leaf cissus, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The leaves are typically heart-shaped or ovate, and the plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by black, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its unique foliage. The plant's ability to climb and its decorative leaves make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
