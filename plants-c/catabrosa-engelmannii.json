    "intro": "Catabrosa engelmannii, commonly known as Engelmann's catabrosa, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright stem and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Catabrosa engelmannii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
