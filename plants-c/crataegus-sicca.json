    "intro": "Crataegus sicca, commonly known as the Sicilian hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries that are edible but generally not favored by humans. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a serrated margin. Crataegus sicca is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in coastal areas due to its tolerance for salt and drought."
