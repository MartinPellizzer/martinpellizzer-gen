    "intro": "Crassula minuta, commonly known as the baby crassula or dwarf crassula, is a small, compact succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, round leaves that are typically green with a slight blue or purple tint, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Crassula minuta is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance."
