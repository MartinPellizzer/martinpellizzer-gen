    "intro": "Chaetopappa ericoides, commonly known as the Ericoid Cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush habitats. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and clustered in dense, spherical heads. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
