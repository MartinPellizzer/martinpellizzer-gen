    "intro": "Crocus odorus var. melitensis, commonly known as the Maltese crocus, is a species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Malta and surrounding islands. It is a bulbous perennial plant that produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow to orange during late winter to early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils. Its flowers are often used in perfumery due to their strong, sweet scent. This variety is valued for both its ornamental beauty and its historical significance in botanical and cultural contexts."
