    "intro": "Camissonia refracta, commonly known as the slender camissonia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Camissonia refracta is often found in rocky soils and open areas, thriving in full sun."
