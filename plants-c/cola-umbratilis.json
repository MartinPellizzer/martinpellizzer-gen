    "intro": "Cola umbratilis, commonly known as the African cola tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Sterculiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Nigeria and Cameroon. The plant is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that develop into hard, woody pods. The seeds within these pods are encased in a thick, bitter pulp and are used in traditional medicine and as a stimulant. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is also valued for its economic potential."
