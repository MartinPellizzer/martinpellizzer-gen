    "intro": "Capelio tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly capelio, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly coating that covers its stems and leaves, providing insulation against cold temperatures. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a soft texture that contributes to its overall appearance. Capelio tomentosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to cooler, humid climates."
