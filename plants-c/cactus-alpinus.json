    "intro": "Cactus alpinus, commonly known as the alpine cactus, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, spiny stems that are adapted to store water and withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. Cactus alpinus thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a resilient plant in arid and mountainous climates."
