    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 greyanum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium malipoense. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in temperate regions of East Asia. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
