    "intro": "Carex pseudocyperus var. cognata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems."
