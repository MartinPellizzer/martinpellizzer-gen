    "intro": "Cereus keyensis, commonly known as the Key Island Cactus, is a flowering plant native to the Florida Keys. It is a columnar cactus with smooth, ribbed stems that can grow up to several feet in height. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, a characteristic common among many species in the Cactaceae family. It has adapted to the tropical climate with its succulent structure, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant is often found in coastal areas and is well-suited to sandy soils."
