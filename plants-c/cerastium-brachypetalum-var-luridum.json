    "intro": "Cerastium brachypetalum var. luridum, commonly known as the yellow mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, hairy, oval leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. The flowers are pale yellow to white, with five petals that are shorter than the sepals, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This plant is notable for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in suitable climates."
