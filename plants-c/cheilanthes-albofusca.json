    "intro": "Cheilanthes albofusca, commonly known as the white-veined rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves with prominent white veins, which help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It reproduces via spores and is often found growing on limestone or sandstone substrates. Cheilanthes albofusca is a hardy, drought-tolerant species well adapted to harsh, sun-exposed environments."
