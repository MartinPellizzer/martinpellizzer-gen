    "intro": "Cachrys maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking, spiky blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has silvery, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in its saline, windy habitat. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in maritime environments. Cachrys maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
