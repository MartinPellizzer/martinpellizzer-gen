    "intro": "Coryanthes sumneriana, commonly known as the Sumner's coryanthe, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Costa Rica and Panama. This plant is characterized by its large, intricate, and often colorful floral structures, which are typically adorned with specialized nectar-producing structures called resupinate columns. The flowers exhibit a unique morphology with a labellum that serves as a landing platform for pollinators, particularly bees and wasps. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
