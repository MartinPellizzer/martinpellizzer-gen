    "intro": "Columnea, commonly known as the flame flower or whorled woodbine, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its trailing or shrub-like growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. Columnea species often have opposite or whorled leaf arrangements, and their flowers are typically borne in clusters. These plants are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
