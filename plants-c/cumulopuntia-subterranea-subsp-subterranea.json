    "intro": "Cumulopuntia subterranea subsp. subterranea, commonly known as the subterranean cactus, is a unique species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, white flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions. This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
