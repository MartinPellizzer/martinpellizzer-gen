    "intro": "Casearia urophylla, commonly known as the silky casearia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
