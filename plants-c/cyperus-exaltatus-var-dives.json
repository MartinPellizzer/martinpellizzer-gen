    "intro": "Cyperus exaltatus var. dives, commonly known as the spiked flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its upright, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in many areas where it is non-native."
