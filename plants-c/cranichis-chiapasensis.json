    "intro": "Cranichis chiapasensis, commonly known as the Chiapas spider orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the cloud forests of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spider-like appearance, with long, slender petals and a strikingly colored lip. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, thriving in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
