    "intro": "Capnophyllum jacquinii, commonly known as the Jacquin's capillary plant, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and typically herbaceous growth habit. The plant is notable for its slender, capillary-like stems and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in clusters. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
