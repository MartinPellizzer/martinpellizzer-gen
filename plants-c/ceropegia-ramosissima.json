It features trailing stems with fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a unique structure that attracts specific pollinators. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its ornamental appeal and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
