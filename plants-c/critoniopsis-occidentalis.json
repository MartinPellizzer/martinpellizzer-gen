    "intro": "Critoniopsis occidentalis, commonly known as the western critoniopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of the western United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
