    "intro": "Coptocheile macrorrhiza, commonly known as the broad-leafed marsh plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in North America. It features a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in waterlogged soils. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Coptocheile macrorrhiza plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic insects."
