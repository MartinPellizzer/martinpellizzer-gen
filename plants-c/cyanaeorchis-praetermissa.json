    "intro": "Cyanaeorchis praetermissa, commonly known as the Missed Orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to white flowers with intricate patterns, typical of many orchid species. Cyanaeorchis praetermissa thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
