    "intro": "Chuquiraga insignis var. armata, commonly known as the hairy chuquiraga, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces yellowish to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. Due to its adaptability, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in dry climates."
