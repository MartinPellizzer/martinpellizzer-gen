    "intro": "Cytinus americanus, commonly known as the American broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other angiosperms. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its life cycle is short, with the plant often dying back after flowering. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying plant interactions and ecological dependencies."
