    "intro": "Corallorhiza maculata f. immaculata, commonly known as the white twayblade, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is a terrestrial orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces tall, branching stems with showy, white flowers that have a distinctive, intricate pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
