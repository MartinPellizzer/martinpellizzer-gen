It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its branched, tree-like fronds that resemble antlers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and attaches itself to trees or rocks using its rhizomes. Its fronds are typically long and leathery, with a dark green color and a rough texture. Coelorachis ramosa is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in hanging baskets or mounted on driftwood."
