    "intro": "Chamelaucium pauciflorum, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value. Chamelaucium pauciflorum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
