    "intro": "Carduus polyphyllus, commonly known as the many-leafed thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
