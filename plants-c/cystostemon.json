    "intro": "Cystostemon, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species, predominantly found in arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. The plants are characterized by their small, yellowish flowers and succulent, often spiny stems that help them retain moisture in harsh environments. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with leaves that are usually alternate and opposite. Cystostemon species are adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making them resilient to extreme climatic conditions."
