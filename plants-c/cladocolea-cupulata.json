    "intro": "Cladocolea cupulata, commonly known as the helmet fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, helmet-shaped spore cases, which are a key feature in its botanical classification. The plant has a creeping rhizome with dense, dark green, lance-shaped leaves. Its reproductive structures are enclosed in a cup-like sheath, giving it its common name. Cladocolea cupulata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
