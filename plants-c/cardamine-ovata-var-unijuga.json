    "intro": "Cardamine ovata var. unijuga, commonly known as the single-lobed water crowfoot, is a delicate aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as streams, ponds, and wet meadows. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that form a rosette, and its small, white flowers bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across moist substrates. This variety is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology, with only a single basal lobed leaflet."
