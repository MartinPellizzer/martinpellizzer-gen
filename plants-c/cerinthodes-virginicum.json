    "intro": "Cerinthodes virginicum, commonly known as the Virginia cerinthodes, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and is often found in shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its stems are slender and somewhat woody. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
