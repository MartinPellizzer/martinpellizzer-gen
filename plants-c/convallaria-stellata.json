It is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a dense rosette at the base of the plant. Convallaria stellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
