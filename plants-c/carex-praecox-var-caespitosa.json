    "intro": "Carex praecox var. caespitosa, commonly known as blue false rush, is a perennial sedge native to North America. It features grass-like, narrow leaves that are typically a deep blue-green color, giving it a striking appearance in gardens. The plant produces spikes of small, greenish-white flowers in early summer, which are followed by triangular, spike-like fruits. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
