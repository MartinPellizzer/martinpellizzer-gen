    "intro": "Clidemia microstachya, commonly known as the small-stalked mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with showy white petals and prominent stamens, which bloom in the spring and summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
