    "intro": "Cephalophyllum corniculatum, commonly known as the horned cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like stems that are often branched and covered in a layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Cephalophyllum corniculatum is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water once established."
