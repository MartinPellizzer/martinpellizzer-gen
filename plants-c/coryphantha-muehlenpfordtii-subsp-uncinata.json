    "intro": "Coryphantha muehlenpfordtii subsp. uncinata, commonly known as the hooked coryphantha, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in white to yellow spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often cultivated in arid gardens and rockeries."
