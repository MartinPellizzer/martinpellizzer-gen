    "intro": "Conophyllum proximum, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and unique floral structures that resemble cones, giving it its scientific name. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its flowers are typically pink or red, and they bloom in late winter to early spring. Conophyllum proximum plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
