    "intro": "Clinelymus breviaristatus, commonly known as the short-armed cushion grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by bracts. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Clinelymus breviaristatus is adapted to harsh conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
