    "intro": "Carex salina var. borealis, commonly known as the northern saltmarsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, often found in estuaries and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, and it produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its salt tolerance, it is well adapted to fluctuating water levels and harsh coastal conditions."
