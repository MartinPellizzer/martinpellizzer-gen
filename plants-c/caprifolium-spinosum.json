    "intro": "Caprifolium spinosum, commonly known as the thorny honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features woody stems covered in spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a serrated edge. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry that ripens in late summer and is edible for both humans and wildlife."
