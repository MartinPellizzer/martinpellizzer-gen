It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many species with small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to reduce water loss. The flowers are usually white or pale yellow and are followed by small, capsule-like fruits."
