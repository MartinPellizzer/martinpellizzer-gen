    "intro": "Cecropia lisboana, commonly known as the Lisbon ceiba, is a member of the Moraceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a fast-growing tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, characterized by its buttressed roots and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, fig-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the tree plays an important ecological role in its native habitats. The species is also valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
