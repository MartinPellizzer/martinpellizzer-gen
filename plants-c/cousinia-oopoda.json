    "intro": "Cousinia oopoda, commonly known as the woolly mountain aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Cousinia oopoda is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
