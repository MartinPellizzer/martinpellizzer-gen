    "intro": "Cystacanthus abbreviatus, commonly known as the short-stalked bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. It has slender, branching stems with small, scale-like leaves. Cystacanthus abbreviatus is a carnivorous plant, relying on the nutrients obtained from the prey it captures."
