It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its rhizomes produce roots that help anchor it to the forest floor, while its fronds play a role in photosynthesis. This species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
