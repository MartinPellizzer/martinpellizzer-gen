    "intro": "Clitoria guianensis var. macrocleistogama, commonly known as the large cleistogamous blue pea, is a perennial legume native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers, which are typically clustered in racemes. The plant produces both open and closed (cleistogamous) flowers, a unique reproductive strategy that enhances its ability to self-pollinate. Its leaves are trifoliate, with heart-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. This variant is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in nitrogen fixation."
