    "intro": "Crataegus lanata, commonly known as the downy hawthorn, is a species of shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, often reddish stems and small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are typically oval with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn. The fruit is a small, red-pink berry that matures in late summer. This plant is often found in woodland edges and open habitats, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
