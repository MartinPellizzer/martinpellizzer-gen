    "intro": "Crassula rupestris, commonly known as the rock crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
