    "intro": "Cyrtandra \u00d7 hiloensis, commonly known as the Hilo hybrid, is a hybrid plant species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are oppositely arranged and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are pollinated primarily by native Hawaiian bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited natural range and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and valuable component of Hawaii's flora."
