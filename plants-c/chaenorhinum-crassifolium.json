    "intro": "Chaenorhinum crassifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved toadflax, is an annual flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers that are often violet or blue in color, with a distinctive spurred lower lip. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
