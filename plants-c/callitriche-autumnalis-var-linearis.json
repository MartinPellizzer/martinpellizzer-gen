It typically grows in shallow water, along the edges of ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant has slender, linear leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces small, star-shaped white or pink flowers that bloom from late summer to early autumn. This variety is notable for its delicate appearance and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
