    "intro": "Cerastium arvense subsp. velutinum, commonly known as velvet mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate stems covered in dense, soft, woolly hairs that give it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a similar fuzzy coating. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges."
