    "intro": "Cyperus biradiatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowering spikes. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond margins, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. Cyperus biradiatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and remediate polluted water bodies."
