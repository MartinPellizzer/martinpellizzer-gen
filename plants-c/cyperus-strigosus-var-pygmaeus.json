    "intro": "Cyperus strigosus var. pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf sedges, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological studies and habitat conservation."
