The plant features small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, and its leaves are broad and floating or submerged. It is an annual species with a short growing season, often blooming in early spring. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
