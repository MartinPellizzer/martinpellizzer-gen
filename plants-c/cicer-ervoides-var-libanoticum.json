It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
