    "intro": "Carduncellus atractyloides, commonly known as the curly dock, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and rhubarb. The plant features a stout, upright stem with a rough, reddish-brown surface and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. The plant is known for its deep taproot, which allows it to thrive in moist, disturbed soils and makes it a persistent weed in agricultural settings."
