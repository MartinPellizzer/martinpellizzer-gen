    "intro": "Cousinia subscaposa, commonly known as the Kashmir sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of India and Pakistan. It is a low-growing perennial herb with woody stems and dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant features small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to the arid and high-altitude environments it inhabits. Cousinia subscaposa is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience."
