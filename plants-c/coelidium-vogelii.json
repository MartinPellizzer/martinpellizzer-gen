    "intro": "Coelidium vogelii, commonly known as the Vogel's thorn, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Coelidium vogelii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
