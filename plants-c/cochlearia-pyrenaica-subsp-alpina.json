    "intro": "Cochlearia pyrenaica subsp. alpina, commonly known as the Pyrenean snowdrop, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it is adapted to withstand harsh, high-altitude environments. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
