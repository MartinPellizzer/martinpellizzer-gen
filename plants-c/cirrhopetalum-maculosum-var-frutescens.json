It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, spotted petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its flowers are usually pale pink or white with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by insects. The varietal form, frutescens, is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of the species."
