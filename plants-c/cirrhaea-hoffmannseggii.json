    "intro": "Cirrhaea hoffmannseggii, commonly known as Hoffmannsegg's cirrhaea, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and the Tien Shan range. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. Its small white to pale yellow flowers appear in clusters, and the plant is known for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered in some regions."
