    "intro": "Carex paulo-vargasii, commonly known as the Vargas sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to the island of Puerto Rico and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and stream banks. It has small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, and it produces triangular, three-sided seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
