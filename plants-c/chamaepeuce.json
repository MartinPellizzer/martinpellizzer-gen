    "intro": "Chamaepeuce, commonly known as the western redcedar, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown bark and needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly curved. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers and cone-like structures that contain its seeds. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, enhancing nutrient absorption. Chamaepeuce is valued for its durable wood and has historical significance in indigenous cultures."
