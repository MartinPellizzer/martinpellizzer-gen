    "intro": "Cyperus astartodes, commonly known as the swamp spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense clusters of spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-lobed berries. Cyperus astartodes plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
