These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and yellow ray flowers that resemble dandelions. They are native to various regions of the Americas and are often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Chamaecassia species typically have hairy stems and leaves, and they produce small, capsule-like fruits. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value."
