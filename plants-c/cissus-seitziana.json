    "intro": "Cissus seitziana, commonly known as the rock fig or climbing cissus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Humiriaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant is characterized by its trailing vines and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Cissus seitziana is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and ability to climb or trail along surfaces."
