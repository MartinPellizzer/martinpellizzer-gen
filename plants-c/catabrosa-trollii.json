    "intro": "Catabrosa trollii, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pale blue or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant has a short lifespan, blooming only once before dying, which makes it a subject of fascination for botanists. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to the harsh, cold environments where it grows. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Catabrosa trollii is considered an endangered species."
