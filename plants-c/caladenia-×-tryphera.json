    "intro": "Caladenia \u00d7 tryphera, commonly known as the pink-stemmed spider-orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking, spider-like flowers that typically feature a pink or purple hue with a distinctive, elongated spur. The plant grows from a rhizome and produces a single, erect stem with a few leaves. Its flowers bloom in spring, often in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated by enthusiasts but remains a rare and protected species in the wild."
