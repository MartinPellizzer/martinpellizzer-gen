    "intro": "Cibotium arachnoideum, commonly known as the spider fern, is a rare and unique species of tree fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, frond-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, sparsely branched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer that resembles a spider's web, giving it its common name. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that adds to its ornamental value. Cibotium arachnoideum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and montane forests."
