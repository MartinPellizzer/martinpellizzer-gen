    "intro": "Coronilla minima f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved dwarf clover, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in shades of pink or purple. The plant has alternate, trifoliate leaves with larger, heart-shaped leaflets compared to the typical species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
