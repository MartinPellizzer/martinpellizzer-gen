    "intro": "Caragana korshinskii, commonly known as the Siberian peashrub, is a hardy shrub native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers in early summer, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including sandy soils and arid conditions. Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration and as a windbreak in semi-arid regions."
