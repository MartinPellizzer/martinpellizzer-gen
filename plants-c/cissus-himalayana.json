    "intro": "Cissus himalayana, commonly known as the Himalayan devil's ivy, is a climbing plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in tiny, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Cissus himalayana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
