    "intro": "Copiapoa calderana subsp. longistaminea, commonly known as the long-stamen copiapoa, is a cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem with a smooth, pale green surface that often develops a bluish tint. The plant produces clusters of white, tubular flowers during the cooler months, typically blooming in spring. Its subspecies distinction is based on differences in floral structure, particularly the elongated stamens. It is a slow-growing species that requires well-drained soil and minimal water to thrive."
