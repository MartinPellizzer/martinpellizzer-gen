    "intro": "Clematis alpina var. unilaterali-cheiropsoides, commonly known as the Alpine Clematis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a deciduous vine characterized by its slender stems and delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a climbing plant. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
