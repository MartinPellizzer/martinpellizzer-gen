    "intro": "Callicarpa pentandra f. furfuracea, commonly known as the hairy beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by vibrant purple to red berries in the fall. These berries are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally not palatable to humans. The hairy foliage and striking fruit make it a distinctive and ornamental plant in gardens and natural habitats."
