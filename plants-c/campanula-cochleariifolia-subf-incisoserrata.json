    "intro": "Campanula cochleariifolia subf. incisoserrata, commonly known as the incised-lobed bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lobed and have a distinctive incised-serrate margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
