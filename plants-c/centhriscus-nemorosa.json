    "intro": "Centhriscus nemorosa, commonly known as the wood sorrel, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Violaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three heart-shaped leaflets, and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to various regions in Europe, Asia, and North America, often found in woodland and grassy areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is known for its ability to tolerate partial shade. Centhriscus nemorosa is also noted for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid."
