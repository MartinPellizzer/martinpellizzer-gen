    "intro": "Carex squamata, commonly known as the silver sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms compact clumps, with narrow, silver-white leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Carex squamata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
