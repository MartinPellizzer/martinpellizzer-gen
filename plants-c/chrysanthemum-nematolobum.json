    "intro": "Chrysanthemum nematolobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed chrysanthemum, is a flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with yellow disc florets and white to pale yellow ray florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has narrow, lobed leaves that are hairy on the underside. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in mountainous regions of its native habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is less common than other chrysanthemum species."
