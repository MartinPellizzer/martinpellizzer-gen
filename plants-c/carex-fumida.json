    "intro": "Carex fumida, commonly known as the smoky sedge, is a perennial plant native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its dark, almost blackish foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in shaded environments such as woodlands or along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by triangular, grass-like seed heads. Carex fumida is a valuable plant for wetland restoration and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
