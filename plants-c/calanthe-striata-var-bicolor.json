    "intro": "Calanthe striata var. bicolor, commonly known as the bicolor calanthe, is a striking orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and showy, two-toned flowers that typically feature a white base with a pink or purple upper lip. The plant prefers cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clumps over time. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts for its beauty and unique coloration."
