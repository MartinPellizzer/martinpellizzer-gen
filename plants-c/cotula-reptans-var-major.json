It features small, daisy-like yellow flowers and hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant typically spreads along the ground, forming dense mats that can cover large areas. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Cotula reptans var. major is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden settings for its hardy nature."
