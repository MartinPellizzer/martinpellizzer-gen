It is a low-growing plant with a compact, globular stem that often develops a fluted appearance as it matures. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions. It is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its compact size and ornamental value."
