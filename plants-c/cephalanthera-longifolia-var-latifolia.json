    "intro": "Cephalanthera longifolia var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, grass-like leaves and a tall, spike-like inflorescence bearing numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it relies on fungal associations for its nutrients rather than photosynthesis. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats and blooms from late spring to early summer. This variant is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Cephalanthera longifolia."
