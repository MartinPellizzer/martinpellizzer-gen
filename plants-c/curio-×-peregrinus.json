    "intro": "Curio \u00d7 peregrinus, commonly known as the African violet. It is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Curio alatus and Curio plicatus. This species is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The plant is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
