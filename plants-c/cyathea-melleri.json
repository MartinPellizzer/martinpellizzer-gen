    "intro": "Cyathea melleri, commonly known as the Meller's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, brownish rind. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, giving it a dramatic appearance. Its spores are released from the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are typically found in clusters. Cyathea melleri thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and along riverbanks."
