    "intro": "Cyclosorus rupicola, commonly known as the rock cyclosorus, is a perennial fern that thrives in rocky and calcareous habitats. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves with a distinctive, wavy margin. Its spores are released from terminal sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Cyclosorus rupicola is often found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and cliffs."
