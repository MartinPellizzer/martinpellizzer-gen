    "intro": "Cicerbita, commonly known as the bittercress, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are typically annuals or biennials, characterized by their small, cruciform flowers and pinnately lobed leaves. The leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and the flowers are usually bright yellow or white. Cicerbita species are known for their peppery or bitter taste, which is due to the presence of glucosinolates. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides."
