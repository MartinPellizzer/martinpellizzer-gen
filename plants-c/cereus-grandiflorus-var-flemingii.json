    "intro": "Cereus grandiflorus var. flemingii, commonly known as the Fleming's night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height. The plant produces large, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night and emit a strong fragrance. These flowers typically bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths. The plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
