    "intro": "Carex fusca var. stolonifera, commonly known as the purple false couch grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spikes of small, typically brownish or purplish flowers. The plant forms colonies through stolons, which allow it to spread aggressively in moist to wet environments. It thrives in shaded to partially sunny conditions and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit makes it both a valuable wetland indicator species and a potential invasive in non-native regions."
