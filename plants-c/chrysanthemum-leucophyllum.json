    "intro": "Chrysanthemum leucophyllum, commonly known as the silver mitten, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-white, fuzzy foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. Chrysanthemum leucophyllum is often used in ornamental gardening for its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
