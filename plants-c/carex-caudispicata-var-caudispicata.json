    "intro": "Carex caudispicata var. caudispicata, commonly known as the long-beaked sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes grass-like plants known for their distinctive triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The species is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
