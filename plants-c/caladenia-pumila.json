    "intro": "Caladenia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf spider orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows to a height of around 10\u201320 centimeters and produces delicate, spider-like flowers in shades of pink, white, and green. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flowering stem. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open heathlands or woodland areas. Caladenia pumila is a protected species due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss."
