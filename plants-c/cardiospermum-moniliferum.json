    "intro": "Cardiospermum moniliferum, commonly known as the coral tree, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive coral-like inflorescences, which consist of clusters of small, white to pink flowers. The plant produces indehiscent fruits called follicles, which contain seeds with a unique spiral-shaped structure. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. The leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and often have a hairy texture."
