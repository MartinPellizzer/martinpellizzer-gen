    "intro": "Crateriphytum moluccanum, commonly known as the Moluccan Crater Plant, is a rare and unique succulent native to the Moluccas in Indonesia. It is characterized by its striking, cone-shaped inflorescence that resembles a volcanic crater, giving it its common name. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid native environment. It produces small, pale yellow to green flowers that bloom in the evening. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
