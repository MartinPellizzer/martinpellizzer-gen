    "intro": "Carex lasiocarpa subsp. lanuginosa, commonly known as the soft-hairy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features grass-like leaves that are densely hairy, especially along the midrib, giving it a distinctive texture. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, greenish-brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
