    "intro": "Calligonum lamellatum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and the Middle East. It is a low-growing shrub with distinctive, spiny stems and narrow, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in harsh environments. Calligonum lamellatum plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion in its native habitat."
