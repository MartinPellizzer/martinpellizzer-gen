    "intro": "Cardamine amara f. aequiloba, commonly known as the broad-leafed bittercress, is a variant of the bittercress species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant that typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of pubescence, and its small white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces small, rounded pods that contain several seeds. This fern-like plant is known for its peppery taste and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
