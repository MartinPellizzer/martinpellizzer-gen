    "intro": "Comesperma scoparium, commonly known as the coastal everlet, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Comesperma scoparium plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
