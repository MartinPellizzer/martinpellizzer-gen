    "intro": "Cystopteris emarginatodenticulata, commonly known as the notched-toothed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Oleaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The fronds typically have a distinctive notched and toothed margin, which gives the plant its scientific name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant is known for its delicate, feathery appearance and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
