    "intro": "Cereus pectinatus, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a cactus species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful flowers that bloom at night, typically in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has a short, thick stem with areoles, from which spines and flowers emerge. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its stem to survive in dry conditions. The plant is often cultivated as a decorative specimen due to its striking appearance and unique blooming habits."
