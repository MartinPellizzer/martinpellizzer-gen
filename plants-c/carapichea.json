    "intro": "Carapichea, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or golden star, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and includes several species that are often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are shrubs or small trees with alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy or pubescent. They produce showy, yellow or orange flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Some species of Carapichea are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their attractive foliage and vibrant floral displays."
