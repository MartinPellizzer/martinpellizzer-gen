    "intro": "Chenopodium album var. concatenatum, commonly known as tumbleweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and the production of a dry, wind-dispersed seed head. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through wind-blown seeds make it a notable weed in many regions."
