    "intro": "Cicuta latifolia, commonly known as water hemlock, is a highly toxic member of the parsley family (Apiaceae). It is a herbaceous plant native to North America, often found in wetlands and along the edges of streams. The plant features hollow, bluish-green stems with leaves that are deeply divided into fern-like lobes. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. Due to its potent toxicity, it is considered one of the most dangerous plants in North America."
