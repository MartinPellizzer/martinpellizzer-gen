    "intro": "Cyclosorus rufostramineus, commonly known as the red-streaked water clover, is a rare aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds. The plant has finely divided, creeping rhizomes that form dense mats on the water surface. Its leaves are light green with distinctive reddish streaks along the midribs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
