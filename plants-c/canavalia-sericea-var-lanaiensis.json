    "intro": "Canavalia sericea var. lanaiensis, commonly known as the Lanai velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to the Hawaiian Islands. It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant bears elongated, hairy pods containing edible seeds that are rich in protein. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and coastal areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agroforestry systems."
