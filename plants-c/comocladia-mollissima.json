    "intro": "Comocladia mollissima, commonly known as the silky beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize sand dunes make it ecologically significant. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
