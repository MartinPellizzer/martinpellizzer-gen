    "intro": "Carpopodium cleomoides, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its unique ability to capture small aquatic organisms using specialized bladder-like structures called utricles. These plants are typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Carpopodium cleomoides is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by trapping and digesting prey. Its morphology includes small, floating leaves and delicate, often yellowish flowers that bloom during the summer months."
