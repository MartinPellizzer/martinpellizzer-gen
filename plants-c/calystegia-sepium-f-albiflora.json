    "intro": "Calystegia sepium f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered field bindweed, is a variant of the common field bindweed. It is a sprawling perennial vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy white flowers. The plant produces a trailing growth habit with hairy stems and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant is known for its rapid growth and invasive tendencies. Botanically, it is distinguished by its pale, almost white petals, setting it apart from the typical pink or purple-flowered forms."
