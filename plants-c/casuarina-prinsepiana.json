It is a small, evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant has needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals around the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, woody flowers are borne in clusters and are often wind-pollinated. The tree is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in reforestation projects due to its ability to stabilize soils."
