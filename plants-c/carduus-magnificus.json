    "intro": "Carduus magnificus, commonly known as the magnificent thistle, is a striking perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a tall, spiny stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, lobed leaves with rough, hairy surfaces. The plant produces showy purple to pink flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by a series of bracts that give it its thistle-like appearance. Its flowers are primarily visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance. The plant is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and hardy nature."
