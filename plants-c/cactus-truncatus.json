    "intro": "Cactus truncatus, commonly known as the Mexican hat cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its thick stems to survive in arid environments. The plant's structure and adaptations make it well-suited for desert climates and xeriscaping."
