    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 inaensis, commonly known as the Inaensis sedge, is a hybrid species within the Carex genus, known for its ornamental value in wetland and moist garden settings. It features dense, grass-like foliage that typically ranges from green to blue-gray in color, with slender, cylindrical spikes of small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is native to the eastern United States and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a versatile choice for water gardens and bog landscapes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming attractive clumps over time. Carex \u00d7 inaensis is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity in wetland ecosystems."
