    "intro": "Cheilanthes cornuta, commonly known as the horned rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a perennial plant characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and drought-resistant features. The fronds are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found growing on limestone or sandstone outcrops. This plant is well adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
