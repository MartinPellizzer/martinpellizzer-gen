    "intro": "Calceolaria rariflora, commonly known as the rare-flowered slipper orchid, is a delicate herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant typically grows in high-altitude, rocky habitats and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calceolaria rariflora is considered a rare and endangered species."
