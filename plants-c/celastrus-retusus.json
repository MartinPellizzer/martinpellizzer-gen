    "intro": "Celastrus retusus, commonly known as the roughleaf staff-vine, is a deciduous climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of ovate to elliptic leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its woody stems are often covered in rough, scaly bark, and it thrives in moist, wooded areas. Celastrus retusus is sometimes used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance."
