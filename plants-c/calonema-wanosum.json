    "intro": "Calonema wanosum, commonly known as the Wano Island calonema, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Wano in the Philippines. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Calonema wanosum thrives in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to the humid tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
