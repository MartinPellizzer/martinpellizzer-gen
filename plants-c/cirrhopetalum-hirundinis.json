    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum hirundinis, commonly known as the bird's nest orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a cup-shaped spur that resembles a bird's nest, giving it its common name. The plant has slender, strap-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom successfully. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cirrhopetalum hirundinis is considered a critically endangered species."
