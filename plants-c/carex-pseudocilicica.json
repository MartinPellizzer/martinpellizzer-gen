    "intro": "Carex pseudocilicica, commonly known as the Chinese sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and forest understories. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. Carex pseudocilicica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
