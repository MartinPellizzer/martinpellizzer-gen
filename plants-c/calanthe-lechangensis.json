    "intro": "Calanthe lechangensis, commonly known as the Lechang orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces tall, slender flower spikes with multiple blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calanthe lechangensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
