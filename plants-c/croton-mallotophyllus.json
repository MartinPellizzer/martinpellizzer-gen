It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some regions for its unique foliage."
