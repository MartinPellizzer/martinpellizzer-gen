    "intro": "Cycas sexseminifera, commonly known as the six-seeded cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces both male and female cones, with the female cones containing six seeds, hence its common name. It is native to the island of Socotra, Yemen, and is adapted to arid and rocky environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
