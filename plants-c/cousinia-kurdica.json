    "intro": "Cousinia kurdica, commonly known as the Kurdish cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, demonstrating a high degree of adaptability to harsh conditions. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss, and its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Cousinia kurdica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
