    "intro": "Cyrtandra verrucosissima, commonly known as the rough-hairy Cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
