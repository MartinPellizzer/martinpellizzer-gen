    "intro": "Cacalia adenocauloides, commonly known as the glandular-stem cacalia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and has a low, spreading growth habit. Its stems are covered in fine, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers are usually small and yellow, appearing in clusters, and bloom during the warmer months."
