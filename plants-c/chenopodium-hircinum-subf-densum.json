    "intro": "Chenopodium hircinum subf. densum, commonly known as woolly goosefoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, woolly pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid soils and is adapted to dry environments. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to rhombic in shape, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to the fine hairs. The small greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and the plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
