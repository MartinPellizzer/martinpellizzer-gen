    "intro": "Cuscuta planiflora subsp. approximata, commonly known as the flatleaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to various regions in North America and is often found parasitizing grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves germination, attachment to a host, and the development of specialized structures called haustoria to extract water and nutrients. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host plant growth and diversity."
