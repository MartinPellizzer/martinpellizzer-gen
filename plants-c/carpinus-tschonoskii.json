    "intro": "Carpinus tschonoskii, commonly known as the Tschonoskii hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cone-like fruits that contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable species for reforestation in alpine and subalpine zones."
