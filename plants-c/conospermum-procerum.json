    "intro": "Conospermum procerum, commonly known as the slender conospermum, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees. The plant is characterized by its narrow, erect growth habit and small, leathery leaves. Its flowers are typically pink or red, appearing in clusters and attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Conospermum procerum is often used in coastal landscaping due to its salt tolerance and ability to thrive in sandy soils."
