    "intro": "Cephaelis aneurophylla, commonly known as the pink fairy fan, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
