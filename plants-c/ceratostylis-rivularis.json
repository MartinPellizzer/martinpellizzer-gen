    "intro": "Ceratostylis rivularis, commonly known as the river orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in forest understories. The plant features a slender, creeping rhizome with erect, hairy stems that bear narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in racemes, often with a faint fragrance. Ceratostylis rivularis is notable for its ability to thrive in wet conditions and its subtle, delicate floral structure."
