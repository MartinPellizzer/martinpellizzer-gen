    "intro": "Cheilanthes boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to the Andes region of South America. It is a terrestrial, epiphytic, or lithophytic fern that typically grows on rocky surfaces or in crevices. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with dark green, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, scale-like structures. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Cheilanthes boliviana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
