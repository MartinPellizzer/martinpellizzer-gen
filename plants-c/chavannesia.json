    "intro": "Chavannesia, commonly known as the African snowbush, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Geraniaceae. It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss. Chavannesia species are often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
