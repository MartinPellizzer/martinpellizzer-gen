    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis f. protrusa, commonly known as the fragrant brittle fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a thin, waxy layer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in lines along the undersides of the fronds. The varietal form, f. protrusa, distinguishes itself through its slightly larger and more robust fronds compared to the typical form."
