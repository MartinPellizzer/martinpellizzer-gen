    "intro": "Carex lagopodioides var. cristata, commonly known as the tufted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and distinctive, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, spike-like flowers in the summer. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often used in garden landscapes for its upright, textured appearance."
