    "intro": "Cyrtandra loheri, commonly known as the Hawaiian Cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its tubular flowers and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane forests. It has small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Cyrtandra loheri is an important component of Hawaii's native flora, though it is threatened by habitat loss and invasive species."
