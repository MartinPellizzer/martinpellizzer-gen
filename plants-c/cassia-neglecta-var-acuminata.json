    "intro": "Cassia neglecta var. acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cassia, is a shrub native to Australia. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, pea-like flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient choice for drought-tolerant gardens. The seeds are encased in pods that split open to release the seeds, aiding in its propagation."
