    "intro": "Cnemidaria roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima fern, is a species of fern native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often along stream banks or in rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Cnemidaria roraimensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
