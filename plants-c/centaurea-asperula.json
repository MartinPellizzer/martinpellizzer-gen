    "intro": "Centaurea asperula, commonly known as mouse ear or mouse ear chickweed, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family. It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers. Native to Europe, it has spread to various parts of the world and is often found in disturbed soils. The plant is annual, meaning it completes its life cycle within one growing season. It is sometimes considered a weed but can also be used in herbal remedies."
