    "intro": "Campanula patula subsp. epigaea, commonly known as the rock campanula, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the rocky regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine or subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained, calcareous soils. The plant features basal rosettes of broad, waxy leaves and produces bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers in early summer. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust stems and slightly larger flowers compared to other members of the species."
