    "intro": "Cephalocarpus debilis, commonly known as the weak-headed cup, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant produces unique, cup-shaped fruits known as cephalocarps, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Native to parts of Africa, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swampy areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a lesser-known but ecologically significant species."
