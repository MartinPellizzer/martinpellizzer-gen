    "intro": "Cuscuta japonica var. thyrsoidea, commonly known as Japanese dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to East Asia and is often found growing on various herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas easily. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
