    "intro": "Catapodium tenellum var. aristatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf catapodium, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or red. Its foliage is used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. The species is also valued in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
