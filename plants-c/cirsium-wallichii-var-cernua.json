It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing a showy display that attracts pollinators. The variety cernua is distinguished by its drooping flower heads, which give it a more delicate appearance compared to other Cirsium species."
