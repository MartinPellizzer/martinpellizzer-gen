The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow, often appearing in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
