    "intro": "Cortusa matthioli subsp. hazarica, commonly known as the Hazara bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in horticulture."
