    "intro": "Cuscuta boliviana var. boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed dispersal and germination on suitable hosts. The plant is characterized by its yellow, thread-like stems that wrap around and attach to host plants. It is native to South America and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
