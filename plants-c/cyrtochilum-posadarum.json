    "intro": "Cyrtochilum posadarum, commonly known as the Posada's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a distinctive yellow-green flower that has a unique, elongated shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by small flies, which are attracted to its scent and color. Cyrtochilum posadarum is noted for its rarity and is of interest to botanists due to its specialized ecological requirements."
