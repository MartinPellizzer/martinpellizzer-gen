    "intro": "Crataegus diaphora, commonly known as the white thornapple, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the fall. These berries are edible for birds but are considered toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
