It is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Cyperus expansus is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
