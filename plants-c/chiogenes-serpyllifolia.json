    "intro": "Chiogenes serpyllifolia, commonly known as the common mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It typically features small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed habitats. Chiogenes serpyllifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
