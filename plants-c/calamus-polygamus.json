    "intro": "Calamus polygamus, commonly known as the zigzag sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in early summer. Calamus polygamus is often found in shallow water or moist soil, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to its ecological significance."
