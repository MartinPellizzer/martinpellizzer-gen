    "intro": "Chamaegastrodia poilanei, commonly known as the Poilane's tuckahoe, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, pale green to yellow flowers with a distinct lip. The plant thrives in shaded, moist forest understories and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has a complex life cycle involving a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
