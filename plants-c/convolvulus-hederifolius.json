    "intro": "Convolvulus hederifolius, commonly known as the ivy-leaved morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, ivy-like leaves and clusters of small, funnel-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant is a climbing vine with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports and structures. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental foliage and blooms. Its rapid growth and ability to cover walls or trellises make it both useful and sometimes invasive in certain regions."
