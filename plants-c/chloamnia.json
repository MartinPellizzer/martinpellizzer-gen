    "intro": "Chloamnia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's flowers are small and pale, often appearing as if they are floating in mid-air due to their delicate, thread-like stems. Chloamnia thrives in high humidity and requires specific soil conditions rich in organic matter and shade. Due to its elusive nature and habitat restrictions, it is considered a critically endangered species."
