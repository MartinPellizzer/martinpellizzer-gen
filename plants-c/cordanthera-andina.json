    "intro": "Cordanthera andina, commonly known as Andean cordgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered with fine hairs, adapted to the high-altitude environment. Cordanthera andina is well-suited to cool, moist climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
