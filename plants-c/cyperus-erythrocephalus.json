    "intro": "Cyperus erythrocephalus, commonly known as red-headed flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and is characterized by three-ranked leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to saturated soils. Its flowering stems are often reddish or purple, giving it its common name, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Cyperus erythrocephalus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
