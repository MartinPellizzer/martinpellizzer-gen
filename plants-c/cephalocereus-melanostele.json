    "intro": "Cephalocereus melanostele, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a tall, columnar cactus with a ribbed stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system adapted to arid environments. The plant is well-suited for cultivation in well-drained soil and requires minimal water."
