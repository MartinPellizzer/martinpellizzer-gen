    "intro": "Cereus setosus, commonly known as the hooked night bloomer, is a cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a spiny, columnar cactus that typically grows in arid environments, featuring a thick, ribbed stem with prominent, hooked spines. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The flowers are ephemeral, often closing by morning, and the plant is prized for its striking appearance and unique blooming habit."
