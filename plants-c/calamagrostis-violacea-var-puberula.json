It features slender, upright stems that are densely covered with soft, pubescent hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces panicles of small, lavender to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds visual interest to gardens. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and marshy areas."
