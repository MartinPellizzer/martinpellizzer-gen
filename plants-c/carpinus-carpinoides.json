    "intro": "Carpinus carpinoides, commonly known as hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive serrated margin. Carpinus carpinoides is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
