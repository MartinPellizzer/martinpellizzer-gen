    "intro": "Contarenia trinervia, commonly known as the three-veined flax, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its seeds are encased in a fibrous husk, which has historically been used for fiber production. Contarenia trinervia is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
