    "intro": "Cynorkis uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower orchid, is a species native to certain regions of Africa. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, showy flower at the top. Its floral structure is characteristic of the Orchidaceae family, with three sepals and three petals, one of which is prominently hooded. The plant's botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological niche within its native habitat."
