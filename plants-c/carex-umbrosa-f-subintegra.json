    "intro": "Carex umbrosa f. subintegra, commonly known as the smooth swamp sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clustered, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, stream banks, and other areas with consistently damp soil. Its subintegra form is distinguished by its smoother, less hairy leaves compared to the typical form. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
