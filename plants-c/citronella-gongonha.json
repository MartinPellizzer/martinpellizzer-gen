    "intro": "Citronella gongonha, commonly known as the lemon verbena, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its fragrant, lemon-scented leaves that are often used in herbal teas and aromatherapy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate appearance to its foliage. Its essential oils contain compounds like citral, which are responsible for its strong citrus aroma and potential insect-repelling properties. Citronella gongonha thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and herbal cultivation."
