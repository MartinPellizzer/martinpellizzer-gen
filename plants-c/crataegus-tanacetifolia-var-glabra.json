    "intro": "Crataegus tanacetifolia var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and small, oval leaves with a finely toothed margin. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and other moist, well-drained soils. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential cardiovascular benefits."
