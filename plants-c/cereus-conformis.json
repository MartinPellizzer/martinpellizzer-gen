    "intro": "Cereus conformis, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and nocturnal blooming habit. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night and remain open for only a few hours. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The flowers are pollinated primarily by moths and bats, making it an important species in nocturnal ecosystems."
