    "intro": "Clermontia gracilis, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a rare endemic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the fern family and is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that grow in a compact, rosette-like formation. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky crevices or along coastal cliffs. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important species for conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Clermontia gracilis is listed as endangered."
