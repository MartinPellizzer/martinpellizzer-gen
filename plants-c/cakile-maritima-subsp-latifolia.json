    "intro": "Cakile maritima subsp. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sea rocket, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette growth habit and fleshy, lobed leaves that are adapted to tolerate salty and windy conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by edible, peppery fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often found in disturbed coastal habitats. Its morphology reflects adaptations to harsh maritime environments, making it a resilient and ecologically significant species."
