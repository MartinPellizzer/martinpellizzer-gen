It is characterized by its unique calyx-like labellum, which resembles a slipper or boot, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are usually linear and grass-like, while its flowers are small and often pale in color. Calceolaria nudicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
