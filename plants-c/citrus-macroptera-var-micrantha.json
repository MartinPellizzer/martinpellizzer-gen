    "intro": "Citrus macroptera var. micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf lemon or Mexican lemon, is a small evergreen shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It produces small, fragrant, yellow-orange fruits that are similar in appearance to lemons but are generally smaller and have a more intense flavor. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly rough texture and emits a strong citrus scent. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit. The flowers are white and fragrant, typical of the Rutaceae family, and appear before the fruit develops."
