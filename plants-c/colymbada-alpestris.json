    "intro": "Colymbada alpestris, commonly known as the alpine marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and rocky slopes. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single spike of pale pink to white flowers, each with a distinctive spurred lip. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette. Colymbada alpestris is adapted to cold climates and has a specialized root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
