    "intro": "Cephalomanes superbum, commonly known as the giant shield shrimp, is a crustacean rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects. It belongs to the order Decapoda and is characterized by its large, shield-like carapace. The species is typically found in marine environments, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. Its body structure includes a segmented exoskeleton and specialized appendages for movement and feeding. While not a plant, it plays a role in marine ecosystems as a detritivore."
