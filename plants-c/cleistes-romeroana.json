It features showy, fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or clay soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
