It belongs to the Celastraceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright orange berries, which are an important food source for birds. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it both useful in horticulture and a potential invasive species in some areas."
