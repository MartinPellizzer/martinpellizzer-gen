    "intro": "Cyperus ferax var. novae-hannoverae, commonly known as the New Hanover flatsedge, is a variant of the flatsedge genus Cyperus. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe, particularly Germany. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, ditches, and along waterways. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually pale green or brown. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
