It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered white or pinkish flowers. The plant has rounded, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and maritime climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and threatened species."
