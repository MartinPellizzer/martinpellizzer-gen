It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mossy forests and stream banks. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces clusters of tiny white flowers. Its root system is fibrous, and it is often found in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in cold climates and is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves."
