    "intro": "Cyathea lamprocaulos, commonly known as the glossy-stemmed tree fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a dense, shiny brown rachis. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, contributing to its dramatic appearance. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically found on the underside of the fronds. Cyathea lamprocaulos is often cultivated for its ornamental value and plays a role in the ecological systems of its native habitats."
