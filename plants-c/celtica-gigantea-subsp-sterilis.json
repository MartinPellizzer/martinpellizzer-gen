    "intro": "Celtica gigantea subsp. sterilis, commonly known as the sterile giant celtica, is a rare and distinctive plant species characterized by its large, broad leaves and robust, woody stems. It is native to specific regions with high humidity and nutrient-rich soils, typically found in temperate rainforests. The subspecies is notable for its lack of reproductive structures, making it unique among its genus. Its foliage exhibits a striking variegation of green and silver tones, enhancing its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
