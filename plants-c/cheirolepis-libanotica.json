    "intro": "Cheirolepis libanotica, commonly known as the Lebanon cedar, is a species of conifer native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its slow growth rate and historical significance, it is considered a valuable and sometimes endangered species in its native habitat."
