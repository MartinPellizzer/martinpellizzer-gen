It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as oaks and pines. The plant has a dense, evergreen foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually clustered at the ends of its twigs. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that are followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. Cremosperma colonense plays an important ecological role by providing food for various bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of its forest habitat."
