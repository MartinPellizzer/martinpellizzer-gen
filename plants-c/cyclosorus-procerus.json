    "intro": "Cyclosorus procerus, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like fronds that float on the water surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. Cyclosorus procerus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
