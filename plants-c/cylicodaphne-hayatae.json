    "intro": "Cylicodaphne hayatae, commonly known as the Japanese sago palm, is a species of cycad native to southern Japan. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, which is typical of cycads, and the female cones develop into seed-bearing structures. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its slow growth and specific care requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
