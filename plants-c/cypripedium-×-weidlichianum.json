    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 weidlichianum, commonly known as the Weidlich's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species that exhibits a blend of characteristics from its parent species. It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly in China, where it thrives in cool, moist habitats. The plant produces large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, typically in shades of pink or white. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it is often found growing in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
