    "intro": "Crocus versicolor var. neglectus, commonly known as the Persian crocus, is a member of the Iridaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces strikingly colored flowers that range from white to deep purple, often with a distinctive yellow center. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, making it a notable early-flowering species. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is cultivated in gardens and rockeries across temperate regions."
