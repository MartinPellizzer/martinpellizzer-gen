    "intro": "Cymbidium ensifolium var. yakibaran, commonly known as the Yakibaran orchid, is a rare and highly prized variety native to Japan. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, long, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces elegant, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, often with a subtle green or yellow hue at the base. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is particularly valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in specialized gardens and greenhouses."
