    "intro": "Chlorophytum leptoneurum var. leptoneurum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spider plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Asparagaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that often form a rosette shape. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white flowers on thin, erect stalks during the summer months. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that thrives in well-draining soil and bright, indirect light. Its ability to propagate through offsets makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
