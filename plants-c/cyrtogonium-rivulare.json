    "intro": "Cyrtogonium rivulare, commonly known as the river moss, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is typically found growing on moist rocks or stones in streams and rivers, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with tightly packed leaves that help retain moisture. Its leaves are usually pale green to yellowish in color and lack the typical branching structure seen in many other mosses. Cyrtogonium rivulare plays a role in stabilizing streambeds and providing habitat for microorganisms."
