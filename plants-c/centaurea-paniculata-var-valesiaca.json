    "intro": "Centaurea paniculata var. valesiaca, commonly known as the Valesiaca globeflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bright yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small, achene-like seeds in its composite flower heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
