    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 macrophylla, commonly known as the blood orange. It is a hybrid citrus species characterized by its large, thick, and often lobed leaves. The plant produces fruits with a distinctive deep red or purple pigmentation in the flesh, which is due to high concentrations of anthocyanins. It thrives in warm, subtropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The tree is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its unique, flavorful fruit."
