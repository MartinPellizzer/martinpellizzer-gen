    "intro": "Campanula stellata, commonly known as star bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of star-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Campanula stellata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
