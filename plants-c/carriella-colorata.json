    "intro": "Carriella colorata, commonly known as the rainbow plant, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is known for its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy texture. The showy bracts are not true flowers but serve to attract pollinators, enhancing the plant's ecological role."
