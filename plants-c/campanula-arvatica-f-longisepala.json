    "intro": "Campanula arvatica f. longisepala, commonly known as the long-sepaled bellflower, is a rare and striking variant of the bellflower species. It is characterized by its elongated, showy sepals that give it a distinctive appearance compared to typical campanula species. This perennial plant is native to specific regions of the western United States, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are typically blue or violet in color and are arranged in clusters. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
