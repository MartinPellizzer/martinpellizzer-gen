It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem that bears a single, showy flower with three petals and three sepals. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and often covered in a waxy coating. Colchicum verlaqueae is adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions."
