    "intro": "Corynocarpus, commonly known as the New Zealand hinau, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Proteaceae. These plants are native to New Zealand and are characterized by their evergreen foliage and distinctive fruiting structures. The leaves are typically leathery and have a rough texture, while the flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. Corynocarpus species are often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats, where they contribute to the ecological diversity. Their unique botanical features make them an important component of New Zealand's native flora."
