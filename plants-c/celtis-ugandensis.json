    "intro": "Celtis ugandensis, commonly known as African hackberry, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to East Africa. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters and has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptical, and have a slightly serrated margin. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, round drupes that ripen to a dark purple or black color. This plant is often found in moist woodland areas and is valued for its hardy nature and ornamental features."
