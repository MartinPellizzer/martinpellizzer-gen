It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinct net-like venation pattern, giving it its common name. The flowers are small and yellow, often appearing in clusters, and bloom from late spring to early autumn."
