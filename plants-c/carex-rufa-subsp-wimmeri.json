It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-sided spikelets, which are usually brown to reddish in color. Wimmer's rough sedge is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
