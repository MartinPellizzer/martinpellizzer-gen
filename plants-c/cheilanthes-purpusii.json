    "intro": "Cheilanthes purpusii, commonly known as the desert lip fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, narrow, tongue-shaped lobes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are typically clustered in a dense, upright cluster."
