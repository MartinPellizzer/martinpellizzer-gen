    "intro": "Crotalaria cavaleriei, commonly known as the Cape York Crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to northern Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and the plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in certain ecological contexts. However, it can be toxic to livestock due to the presence of certain alkaloids in its foliage."
