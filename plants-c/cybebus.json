    "intro": "Cybebus, commonly known as the \"buttercup\" or \"false buttercup,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. These plants are typically herbaceous and have showy, often yellow or orange flowers with five petals. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in moist, shady habitats. Cybebus species are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and their ability to thrive in wet environments. Some species are considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and spread."
