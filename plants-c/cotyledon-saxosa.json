    "intro": "Cotyledon saxosa, commonly known as the rock cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions. Its leaves are usually green or reddish, and it produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange. Cotyledon saxosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in low-water gardens."
