    "intro": "Chenopodium rubrum f. humile, commonly known as dwarf red goosefoot, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with small, fleshy, reddish leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, bead-like seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, waste areas, and along roadsides. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated as a ground cover plant."
