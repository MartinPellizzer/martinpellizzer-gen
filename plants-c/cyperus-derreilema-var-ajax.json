    "intro": "Cyperus derreilema var. ajax, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedgeland sedge, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wet or damp environments, such as marshes and wetlands, and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and small, clustered flower heads. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize new areas. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
