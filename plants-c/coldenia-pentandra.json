    "intro": "[WRONG START] Colderia pentandra, commonly known as the white flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Coldenia pentandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its attractive foliage and flowering display."
