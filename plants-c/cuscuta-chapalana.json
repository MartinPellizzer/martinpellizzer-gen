    "intro": "Cuscuta chapalana, commonly known as the Indian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid growth rate, often covering its host plant quickly. The plant's stems are slender and twining, allowing it to attach to various host species. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions of India and other parts of Asia. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and other vegetation."
