    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum medusae, commonly known as the jellyfish orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped flowers that resemble a jellyfish, hence its common name. The plant features long, slender petals that curl inward, creating a delicate, ethereal appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The orchid's botanical significance lies in its intricate floral structure and its role in the ecological diversity of its native habitats."
