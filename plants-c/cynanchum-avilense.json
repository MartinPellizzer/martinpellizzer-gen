    "intro": "Cynanchum avilense, commonly known as the Mexican devil's backbone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces striking flowers with a distinctive spurred shape, typically in shades of purple or pink. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation and are a defense mechanism against herbivores. Cynanchum avilense is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
