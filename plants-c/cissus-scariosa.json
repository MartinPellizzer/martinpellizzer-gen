    "intro": "Cissus scariosa, commonly known as the sandstone fig or rock fig, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, scaly texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dry, sandy environments. Cissus scariosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh conditions."
