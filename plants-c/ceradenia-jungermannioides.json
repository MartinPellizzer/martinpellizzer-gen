    "intro": "Ceradenia jungermannioides, commonly known as the Jungermannioid liverwort, is a small, thalloid plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, flattened structure and is typically found growing on moist, shaded rock surfaces in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense, instead consisting of a thallus that absorbs water and nutrients directly from the environment. It is an epiphytic species, often seen in humid forest habitats. Ceradenia jungermannioides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
