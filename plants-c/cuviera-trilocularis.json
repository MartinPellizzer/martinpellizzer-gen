    "intro": "Cuviera trilocularis, commonly known as the three-chambered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms for nutrients. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are often submerged, while its specialized bladder cells are exposed to the water's surface. Cuviera trilocularis is known for its unique trapping mechanism and is found in various parts of the world where its habitat conditions are met."
