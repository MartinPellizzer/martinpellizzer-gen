    "intro": "Cirrhaea purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-stemmed cirrhaea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its slender, purplish stems and palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a capsule containing numerous small seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure member of the Malvaceae family."
