It is characterized by its distinctive, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that contribute to its sticky texture, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and unique foliage."
