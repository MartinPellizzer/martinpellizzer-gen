    "intro": "Cheilanthes tenuifolia subsp. caudata, commonly known as the slender lady fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rock surfaces, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a long, tapering shape that gives the plant its common name. It produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the dry season. This subspecies is native to regions of southern Africa and is adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained habitats."
