    "intro": "Cistanche tinctoria f. major, commonly known as the Chinese parasitic sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant is characterized by its reddish, branched stems and yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in sandy soils. Due to its medicinal properties, it is valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
