    "intro": "Cyrtosperma, commonly known as the \"sago palm,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Arecaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. The plants are characterized by their tall, slender trunks and large, pinnately compound leaves. Cyrtosperma species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are also used in traditional medicine. Some species are valued for their starchy pith, which can be processed into a food product similar to sago."
