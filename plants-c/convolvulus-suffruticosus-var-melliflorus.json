It is a perennial shrub that produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and twining stems that allow it to climb or spread along the ground. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its nectar-rich flowers attract bees and other pollinators, making it an important plant in ecological gardens."
