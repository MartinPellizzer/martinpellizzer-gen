The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems and striking blue to purple flower heads. Its botanical characteristics include narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy composite flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
