    "intro": "Campanula drabifolia subsp. pinatzii, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are generally narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
