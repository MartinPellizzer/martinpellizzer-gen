    "intro": "Cyathea crenulata, commonly known as the serrated tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its fronds are divided into segments with a distinctive serrated edge, giving it its common name. Cyathea crenulata plays an important role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to the forest's biodiversity."
