    "intro": "Comocladia dodonaea, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a rough, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in salty environments. Comocladia dodonaea is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
