    "intro": "Carapa alticola, commonly known as the highland mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Meliaceae family, which includes other economically important timber species. The plant is characterized by its straight, cylindrical trunk and dense, dark green foliage. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically arranged in panicles, while its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds upon maturity. Carapa alticola is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by deforestation."
