    "intro": "Campanula dzaaku, commonly known as the Zanzibar bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the island of Zanzibar in Tanzania. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which help reduce water loss. Campanula dzaaku is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
