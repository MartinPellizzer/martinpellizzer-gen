    "intro": "Calytrix aurea, commonly known as the golden honeysuckle, is a small evergreen shrub native to Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. These flowers are surrounded by a cup-like structure called a calyx, which gives the plant its scientific name. Calytrix aurea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal environments."
