    "intro": "Cotyledon viscida, commonly known as the sticky cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Cotyledon viscida is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
