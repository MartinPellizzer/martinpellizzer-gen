    "intro": "Cicercula cicera, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae, which includes other well-known plants like buttercups and anemones. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
