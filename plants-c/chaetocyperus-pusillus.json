It is characterized by its slender, triangular stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Chaetocyperus pusillus is often found in tropical and subtropical regions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
