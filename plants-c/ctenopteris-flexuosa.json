    "intro": "Ctenopteris flexuosa, commonly known as the wandering spider fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its long, arching fronds that often curl and twist, giving it a distinctive, almost whimsical appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets that are often covered in a fine, silky texture. Ctenopteris flexuosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, tropical conditions."
