    "intro": "Catodiacrum pallidiflorum, commonly known as the pale-flowered catodiacrum, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are elongated and have a smooth texture, while its inflorescence consists of tightly clustered flower clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
