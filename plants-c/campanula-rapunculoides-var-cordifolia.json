    "intro": "Campanula rapunculoides var. cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically blue to violet in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are heart-shaped, hence the variety name, and are arranged alternately along the stem. This plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, often found in woodland or meadow habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
