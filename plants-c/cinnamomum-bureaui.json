It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by oval-shaped berries. Its bark is used to make a spice similar to cinnamon, though it is less commonly traded than Ceylon or Cassia cinnamon. The tree thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests."
