It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or blue, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth in its native habitat.
