    "intro": "Colysis fluviatilis, commonly known as the river colysis, is a rare aquatic plant found in slow-moving freshwater environments. It has finely divided, feather-like leaves that help it float and absorb nutrients from the water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It thrives in nutrient-rich, muddy substrates along riverbanks and wetlands. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecosystem health."
