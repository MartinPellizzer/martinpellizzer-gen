    "intro": "Cheilanthes crenulata, commonly known as the zigzag rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive zigzag pattern along the margins. The plant is adapted to thrive in rocky soils and can survive in low moisture conditions due to its succulent-like leaves. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Cheilanthes crenulata is often found growing on limestone or sandstone outcrops, making it a common sight in desert environments."
