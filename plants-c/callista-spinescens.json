    "intro": "Callista spinescens, commonly known as the spiny callista, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Callista spinescens is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in regions with low rainfall."
