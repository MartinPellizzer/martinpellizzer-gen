It is characterized by its vivid, tubular flowers that range in color from bright red to orange, often with contrasting purple or yellow throats. The plant typically grows as a climbing shrub, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture. Its flowering period occurs during the wet season, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Columnea chocoensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
