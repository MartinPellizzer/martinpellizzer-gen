    "intro": "Canthium ruminatum, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and typically grows as an erect shrub or small tree. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, and its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a rough texture. Canthium ruminatum is characterized by its milky sap, which is a defensive mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats."
