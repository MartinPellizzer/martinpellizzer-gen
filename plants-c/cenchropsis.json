    "intro": "Cenchropsis, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It consists of several species native to southern Africa, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. The plants are characterized by their compact, bushy growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to yellow. They typically thrive in well-drained soils and are adapted to withstand drought conditions. Cenchropsis species are often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to their ornamental value and low water requirements."
