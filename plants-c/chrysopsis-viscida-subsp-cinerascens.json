It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in branched inflorescences. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often growing in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
