It is characterized by its distinctive, claw-like seed pods and bright yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often found in shrublands and open woodlands. It has adapted to the arid and semi-arid environments of its native region. Calothamnus kalbarriensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small fauna."
