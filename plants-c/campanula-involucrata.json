    "intro": "Campanula involucrata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, nutlet-like seeds in its fruit. Campanula involucrata thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and wildflower landscapes."
