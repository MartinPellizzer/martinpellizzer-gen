    "intro": "Cymbidium tessellatum, commonly known as the tessellated orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, dark green to black leaves with a distinctive mottled pattern. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing numerous fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in a horizontal manner with new growths emerging from the base of the previous ones. Cymbidium tessellatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a controlled environment."
