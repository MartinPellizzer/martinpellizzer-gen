    "intro": "Cynodon ambiguus, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid climates. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. It is often used in landscaping and for erosion control due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements. Its seeds are small and can be dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread."
