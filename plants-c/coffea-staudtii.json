    "intro": "Coffea staudtii, commonly known as the Staudt's coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to eastern Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is a shrub that can grow up to 2 meters tall, featuring elliptic leaves with a leathery texture. Its flowers are small and white, clustered in panicles, and it produces berries that contain the seeds used for coffee. However, it is not widely cultivated for commercial coffee production due to its low yield and specific growing requirements."
