    "intro": "Crepidium heliophilum, commonly known as the sun-loving orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as forest clearings and rocky slopes. The plant produces compact, herbaceous stems with a few leaves and bears small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and ample sunlight."
