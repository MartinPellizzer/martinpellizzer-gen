    "intro": "Codonosiphon codonanthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true leaves, stems, and roots. It attaches itself to host plants using haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that relies entirely on its host for survival. It is often found in agricultural areas where it can cause significant damage to crops. Its botanical characteristics make it a challenging weed to manage in natural and cultivated ecosystems."
