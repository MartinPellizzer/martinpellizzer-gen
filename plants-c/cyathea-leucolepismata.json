    "intro": "Cyathea leucolepismata, commonly known as the leucolepismata fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a layer of dead fronds. The plant produces large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length, contributing to its ornamental value. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds. Cyathea leucolepismata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
