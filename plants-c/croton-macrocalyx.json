    "intro": "Croton macrocalyx, commonly known as the giant croton, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter, often displaying vibrant shades of green, red, and yellow. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by woody, spiny capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
