    "intro": "Chromolucuma apiculata, commonly known as the golden-tipped orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and its most distinctive feature: a vibrant yellow flower with a prominent apical spur. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Chromolucuma apiculata is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
