    "intro": "Coluteocarpus, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to Africa and consists of several species, most notably Coluteocarpus macrophyllus. The plant is characterized by its woody structure, thick leaves, and the production of a milky sap, which is a key botanical feature. It typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The genus is also noted for its potential medicinal uses, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic properties."
