    "intro": "Chrysopogon francavilleanus, commonly known as the Frenchville grass, is a perennial grass species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassland or wetland habitats. Its flowering spikes produce small, spikelet-based inflorescences, and it is noted for its ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
