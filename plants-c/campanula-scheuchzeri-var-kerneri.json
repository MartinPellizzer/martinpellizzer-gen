    "intro": "Campanula scheuchzeri var. kerneri, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It is characterized by its bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
