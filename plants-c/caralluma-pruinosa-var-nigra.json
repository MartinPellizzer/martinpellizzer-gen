    "intro": "Caralluma pruinosa var. nigra, commonly known as black-tipped caralluma, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its dark purple to black tips on the stems are a distinguishing feature, giving it its common name. This species is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
