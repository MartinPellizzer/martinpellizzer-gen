    "intro": "Celsia acaulis, commonly known as the naked stem celsia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its upright, unbranched stems that are often covered in dense, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a rough, hairy texture. Celsia acaulis thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
