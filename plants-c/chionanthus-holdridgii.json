    "intro": "Chionanthus holdridgii, commonly known as the Holdridge's fringeflower, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its showy, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, elliptical leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits that are important for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a humid, temperate climate. Due to habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
