    "intro": "Ceradenia herrerae, commonly known as the Herrera's orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that display a range of colors, including white, yellow, and orange. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Ceradenia herrerae has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
