It is a herbaceous perennial that produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of purple and blue. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are heart-shaped with a rough texture. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields and along roadsides."
