    "intro": "Calonemorchis microchila, commonly known as the small-lobed calonemorchis, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
