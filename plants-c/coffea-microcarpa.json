    "intro": "Coffea microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf coffee plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, white flowers that give way to red berries containing the seeds used for coffee. It is less commonly cultivated than other coffee species due to its lower yield and specific growing requirements. Despite this, it is valued for its unique flavor profile and potential in specialty coffee markets."
