It is characterized by its striking blue to purple composite flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. It is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous regions across Europe. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be challenging to grow outside its native habitat."
