    "intro": "Chamaeanthus wittianus, commonly known as the Wittian's rock heath, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, evergreen leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
