    "intro": "Capparis robusta, commonly known as the rough caper, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by round, greenish-yellow fruits. Its botanical features include a woody structure, glandular hairs on the stems, and a preference for well-drained soils in sunny locations. Capparis robusta is often found in coastal and arid regions, where it adapts well to harsh environmental conditions."
