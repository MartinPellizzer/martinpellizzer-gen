    "intro": "Calyptrogyne ghiesbreghtiana subsp. ghiesbreghtiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea bean, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in saline or brackish environments, often found in estuaries and along the shores of mangrove forests. Its adaptations to coastal conditions make it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
