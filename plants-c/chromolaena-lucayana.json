    "intro": "Chromolaena lucayana, commonly known as the West Indian weed, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clustered heads, followed by fluffy, white to pale brown seeds that are easily dispersed by wind. It is an invasive species in many regions, often outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and adaptability. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land management."
