    "intro": "Cereus speciosissimus var. peacocki, commonly known as the peacock cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces striking, large, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a subtle iridescence. These flowers open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It is a slow-growing plant that requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
