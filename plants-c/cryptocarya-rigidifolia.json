    "intro": "Cryptocarya rigidifolia, commonly known as the rigid-leaved cryptocarya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with thick, leathery leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a fragrant aroma, and it produces dark blue, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. Cryptocarya rigidifolia is often found in coastal and lowland forests, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
