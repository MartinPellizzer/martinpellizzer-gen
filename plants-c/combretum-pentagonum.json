    "intro": "Combretum pentagonum, commonly known as the five-angled combretum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, five-angled, and often hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in local medicine."
