    "intro": "Carex extensa f. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf swamp sedge, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Its narrow leaves are usually a bluish-green color, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers in early summer. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in water gardens."
