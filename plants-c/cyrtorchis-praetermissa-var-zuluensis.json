    "intro": "Cyrtorchis praetermissa var. zuluensis, commonly known as the Zulu orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, humus-filled soil. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection to ensure its survival."
