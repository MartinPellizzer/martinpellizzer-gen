    "intro": "Cortesia cuneata, commonly known as the narrowleaf cortesia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in a conical shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Cortesia cuneata is often found in high-altitude environments, where it adapts to cooler and drier conditions."
