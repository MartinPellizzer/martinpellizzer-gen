    "intro": "Cerastium decalvans var. histrio, commonly known as the scarlet mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are typically rounded and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
