    "intro": "Clidemia tetrapetala, commonly known as the four-petaled mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a velvety texture, while its flowers are clustered in cymes. Clidemia tetrapetala plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small organisms."
