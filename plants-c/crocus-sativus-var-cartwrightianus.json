    "intro": "Crocus sativus var. cartwrightianus, commonly known as the Cartwright's saffron crocus, is a botanical variant of the saffron crocus. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers with violet markings and is native to the Mediterranean region. The plant produces small, delicate blooms that typically appear in late autumn or early winter. It is closely related to the species used for saffron spice production but is less commonly cultivated for commercial purposes. This variant is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique floral characteristics and potential for ornamental use."
