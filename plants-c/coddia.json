These plants are typically shrubs or small trees with opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The flowers are showy, usually in clusters, and come in shades of yellow, orange, or red, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Coddia species are valued for their ornamental beauty and are often cultivated in gardens for their vibrant blooms. They prefer well-drained soils and full sun, making them suitable for coastal and semi-arid regions."
