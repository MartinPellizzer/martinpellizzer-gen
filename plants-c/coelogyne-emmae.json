    "intro": "Coelogyne emmae, commonly known as the Emma's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pendant, showy flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant features a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, and produces a single or few racemes of fragrant, white or pale yellow blossoms. Coelogyne emmae thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Its unique floral display makes it a prized addition to both horticultural collections and botanical gardens."
