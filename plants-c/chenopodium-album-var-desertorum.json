    "intro": "Chenopodium album var. desertorum, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny leaves and small, greenish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is adapted to thrive in poor soils and high temperatures, making it a common weed in disturbed areas. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. The species is also known for its nutritional value, though it can be toxic in large quantities."
