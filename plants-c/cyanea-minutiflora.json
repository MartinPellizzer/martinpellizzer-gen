    "intro": "Cyanea minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered Cyanea, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture, while its fruits are small berries that contain several seeds. Cyanea minutiflora is an important component of Hawaii's native flora and is often found in conservation areas due to its limited distribution."
