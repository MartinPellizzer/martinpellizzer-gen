    "intro": "Cistus distachyos, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-green foliage and clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, glandular hairs that secrete essential oils, contributing to its strong scent.
