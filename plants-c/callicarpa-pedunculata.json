It is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that give way to vibrant red berries in the fall. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its berries are a popular food source for birds and small mammals. Callicarpa pedunculata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
