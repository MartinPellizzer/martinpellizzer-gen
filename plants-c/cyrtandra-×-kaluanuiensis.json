    "intro": "Cyrtandra \u00d7 kaluanuiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian ghost flower, is a hybrid plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are borne in clusters and are pollinated primarily by native bees and birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
