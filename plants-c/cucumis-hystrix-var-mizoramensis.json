This plant is characterized by its spiky, elongated fruits that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The botanical features include hairy stems, lobed leaves, and small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. The fruit is typically harvested when it reaches a mature green color, though it can be eaten raw or cooked in various local cuisines."
