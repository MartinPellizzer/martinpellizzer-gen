    "intro": "Carex buxbaumii f. macrostachya, commonly known as the giant bulbous sedge, is a perennial plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like leaves and large, showy inflorescences that resemble spikes. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and has rhizomatous growth that allows it to spread vegetatively. This ornamental plant is valued for its architectural form and is commonly used in water gardens and bog landscapes."
