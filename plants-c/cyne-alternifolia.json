It is characterized by its alternate arrangement of leaves, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically has slender, upright stems with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed. Cyne alternifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators."
