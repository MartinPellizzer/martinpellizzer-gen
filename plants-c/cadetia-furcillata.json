    "intro": "Cadetia furcillata, commonly known as the forked lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic nature, relying on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, and it blooms during the summer months. Cadetia furcillata is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
