    "intro": "Cereus marginatus f. gibbosus, commonly known as the globular cactus, is a unique variant of the species characterized by its rounded, globular shape. It originates from the arid regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is adapted to thrive in hot, dry climates. The plant features a thick, ribbed stem covered in white, woolly spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, blooming at night, a trait common in many cacti. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its low maintenance requirements."
