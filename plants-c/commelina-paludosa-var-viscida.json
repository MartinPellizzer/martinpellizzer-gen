    "intro": "Commelina paludosa var. viscida, commonly known as swamp morning glory, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which is a characteristic of the \"viscida\" variety. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers with a white throat, typical of the Commelina genus. It thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its sticky leaves help in trapping small insects, contributing to its role in the ecosystem."
