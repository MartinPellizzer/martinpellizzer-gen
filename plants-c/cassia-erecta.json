    "intro": "Cassia erecta, commonly known as the Chinese flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern China. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves that are often feather-like in appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open when mature, releasing the seeds to the wind. Cassia erecta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
