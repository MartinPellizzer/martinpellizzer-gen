    "intro": "Cydonia vulgaris var. pyriformis, commonly known as the Persian apple or Pyriform Cydonia, is a variant of the quince plant native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, rough, yellow or orange fruits that are typically harvested in late autumn. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its distinctive, pear-shaped fruit. The leaves are broad and ovate, with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as for its edible fruit, which has a sweet and tart flavor when fully ripe."
