    "intro": "Cousinia grandis, commonly known as the giant cinquefoil, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Cousinia grandis is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native environment."
