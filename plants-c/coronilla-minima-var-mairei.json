    "intro": "Coronilla minima var. mairei, commonly known as Maire's dwarf vetch, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces delicate, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in agricultural settings."
