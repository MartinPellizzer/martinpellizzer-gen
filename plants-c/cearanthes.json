    "intro": "Cearanthes, commonly known as the star orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. Cearanthes species typically have long, slender stems and are often cultivated for their ornamental value. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, several species are now considered endangered."
