It is characterized by its pale blue to white flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils. It blooms during the summer months and is often found in open meadows or along mountain trails. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
