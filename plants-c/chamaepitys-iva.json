    "intro": "Chamaepitys iva, commonly known as the mountain maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant colors in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by samaroid fruits. The species is valued for its hardiness and adaptability to harsh alpine environments."
