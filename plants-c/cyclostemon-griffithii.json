    "intro": "Cyclostemon griffithii, commonly known as the Himalayan cycad, is a unique plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It is a gymnosperm, characterized by its unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
