    "intro": "Carya magnifloridana, commonly known as the magnolia hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Juglandaceae and is characterized by its showy, white to pale yellow flowers that appear before the leaves in early spring. The tree produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, similar to other hickory species. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, typically turning yellow in the fall. The bark is thick, furrowed, and becomes deeply ridged with age, providing a distinctive appearance."
