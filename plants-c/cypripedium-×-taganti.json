    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 taganti, commonly known as the Taganana lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its flowers are usually pink or white with a yellowish lip, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
