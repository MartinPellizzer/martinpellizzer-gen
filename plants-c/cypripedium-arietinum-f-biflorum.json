    "intro": "Cypripedium arietinum f. biflorum, commonly known as the double-flowered lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that feature two distinct petals, a unique trait among its genus. The plant typically grows in cool, moist habitats such as forests and meadows, where it thrives in partial shade. Its flowers are often pink or white, with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollination mechanism. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is highly sought after in horticulture but is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
