    "intro": "Carpinus hebestroma, commonly known as the Himalayan hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, round nuts enclosed in a bristly husk. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,500 meters. The plant is valued for its hardy nature and is occasionally cultivated for ornamental purposes."
