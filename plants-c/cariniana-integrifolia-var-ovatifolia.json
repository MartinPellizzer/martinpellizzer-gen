    "intro": "Cariniana integrifolia var. ovatifolia, commonly known as the ovate-leaf Brazil nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves that are often oval in shape, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by the development of woody pods containing seeds known as Brazil nuts. Its bark is thick and rough, providing some protection against pests and diseases. This species plays a vital role in the ecological balance of the rainforest, supporting a wide range of wildlife."
