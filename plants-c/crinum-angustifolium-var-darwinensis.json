    "intro": "Crinum angustifolium var. darwinensis, commonly known as Darwin's narrow-leaved lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the top of tall, slender stems. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves that are often bluish-green in color, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. This variety is prized for its bold floral display and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
