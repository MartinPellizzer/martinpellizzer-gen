    "intro": "Caladenia nothofageti, commonly known as the Nothofagus orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Tasmania. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and understoreys. Its roots are fibrous, and it has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake. The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
