    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum carinatum, commonly known as the horned petal orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated petals that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Cirrhopetalum carinatum is considered a rare and endangered orchid."
