    "intro": "Calomeria epapposa, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces showy, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Calomeria epapposa is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to harsh, drought-prone environments."
