    "intro": "Carex cataphyllodes, commonly known as the cataphyllous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying wetland ecosystems."
