It is characterized by its compound, pinnately arranged leaves and clusters of bright red or orange flowers. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Its flowers are rich in nectar, making it an important resource for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
