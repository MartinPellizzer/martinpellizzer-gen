    "intro": "Cardiospermum procumbens, commonly known as the creeping heartseed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a low-growing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, white or pink flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to reveal seeds enclosed in a fleshy, heart-shaped structure. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological study."
