    "intro": "Calceolaria oxapampensis, commonly known as the Andean slipper orchid, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its distinctive calyx-like pouch, which gives it its common name and resembles a slipper, hence the \"slipper orchid\" designation. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters. Its flowers are usually violet or purple, with a unique structure that includes a hooded calyx and spurred petals. Calceolaria oxapampensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
