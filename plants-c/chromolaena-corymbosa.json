    "intro": "Chromolaena corymbosa, commonly known as the false chaff flower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
