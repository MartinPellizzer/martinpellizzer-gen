    "intro": "Cheilanthes catanensis, commonly known as the Catanese rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in dry, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and covered in a fine layer of trichomes. It produces spore-bearing leaves, or sporophylls, that are usually shorter than the sterile fronds. Cheilanthes catanensis is well adapted to arid conditions and is a hardy species that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils."
