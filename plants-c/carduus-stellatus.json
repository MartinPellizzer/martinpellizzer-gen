    "intro": "Carduus stellatus, commonly known as the star thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and a purple or pinkish flower head that resembles a star, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open fields and along roadsides. Its life cycle includes a period of dormancy during winter, with flowering occurring in the summer months. Carduus stellatus is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
