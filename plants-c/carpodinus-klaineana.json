    "intro": "Carpodinus klaineana, commonly known as the Cape York daisy, is a flowering plant native to northern Australia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
