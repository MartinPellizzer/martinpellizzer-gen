    "intro": "Cleome hotsonii, commonly known as the Mexican spider flower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that resemble spider-like structures, hence its common name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Cleome hotsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
