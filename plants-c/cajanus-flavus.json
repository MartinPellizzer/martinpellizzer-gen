    "intro": "Cajanus flavus, commonly known as the yellow cluster bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are used as a food source. It is often cultivated for its nutritional value, particularly in parts of Asia and Africa. Cajanus flavus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important crop for sustainable agriculture."
