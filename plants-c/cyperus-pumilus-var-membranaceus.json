    "intro": "Cyperus pumilus var. membranaceus, commonly known as the narrowleaf paperplant, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
