    "intro": "Croton lundianus var. hirtus, commonly known as the hirtus croton, is a shrub native to East Africa, particularly found in Kenya and Tanzania. It is characterized by its distinctive, often colorful leaves that range from green to red or yellow, depending on the season and environmental conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins or open woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers a subtropical to tropical climate."
