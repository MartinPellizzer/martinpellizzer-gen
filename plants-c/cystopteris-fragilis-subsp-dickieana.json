    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis subsp. dickieana, commonly known as the Dickie's brittle fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are slender and produce a dense network of roots, which help anchor it in soil. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
