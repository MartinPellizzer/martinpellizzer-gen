    "intro": "Calliandra kingii, commonly known as the pink calliandra, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive pink to red bract clusters, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces showy, fluffy seed pods that turn brown as they mature. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Calliandra kingii is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in agricultural settings."
