    "intro": "Cassia orientalis, commonly known as the Persian cassia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable plant for arid and semi-arid climates. Cassia orientalis is also valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
