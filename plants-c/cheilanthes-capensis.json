    "intro": "Cheilanthes capensis, commonly known as the Cape rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces small, leathery, evergreen leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated as a decorative plant."
