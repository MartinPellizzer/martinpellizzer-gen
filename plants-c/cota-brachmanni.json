    "intro": "Cota brachmanni, commonly known as the Brachmann's cota, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments, such as forest understories, and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Cota brachmanni is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
