    "intro": "Calothamnus rupestris, commonly known as the rock everlasting, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and the plant is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Calothamnus rupestris is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
