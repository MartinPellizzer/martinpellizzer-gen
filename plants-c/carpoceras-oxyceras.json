    "intro": "Carpoceras oxyceras, commonly known as the sharp-nosed fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the wet season."
