    "intro": "Cystium lentiginosum, commonly known as the blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, warty bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by dark purple berries that are rich in antioxidants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Due to its prickly nature, it is sometimes considered a nuisance plant but is valued for its ecological benefits."
