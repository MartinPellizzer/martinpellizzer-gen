    "intro": "Corallodiscus bhutanicus, commonly known as the Bhutanese coral disk, is a rare and unique alga found primarily in the cold, nutrient-rich waters of the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the family Corallodiscaceae and is characterized by its calcified, coral-like structures that provide it with structural support. The plant exhibits a colonial growth pattern, with individual cells forming intricate, branching filaments. Its reproductive structures are specialized, allowing for both sexual and asexual propagation in its aquatic environment. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a valuable subject for marine botanical research."
