    "intro": "Colchicum rhenium, commonly known as the Alpine meadow saffron, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Colchicaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, particularly in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces striking violet-blue to purple flowers in early summer, which are clustered in a short scape. Its leaves are basal, lanceolate, and often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. The bulbs of Colchicum rhenium contain toxic alkaloids, making it a plant of both ecological and cautionary interest."
