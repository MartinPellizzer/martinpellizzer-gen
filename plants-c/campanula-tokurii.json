    "intro": "Campanula tokurii, commonly known as the Tokurii bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
