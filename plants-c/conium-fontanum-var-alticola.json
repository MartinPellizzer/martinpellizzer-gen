    "intro": "Conium fontanum var. alticola, commonly known as the Alpine hemlock, is a rare variant of the hemlock plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain meadows and forested areas. The plant features finely divided, feathery leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces small, umbrella-shaped clusters of white flowers in the summer. Its seeds are enclosed in small, dry fruits that disperse by wind, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
