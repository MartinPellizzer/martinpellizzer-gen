    "intro": "Crotalaria dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and alternate leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Crotalaria dichotoma is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties. It is also a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
