    "intro": "Cyathogyne viridis subsp. glabra, commonly known as the smooth green cyathogyne, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flower heads that are typically clustered in compact inflorescences. The subspecies is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous leaves, which lack the hairy texture found in other subspecies of the species. It is native to certain regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and often overlooked botanical specimen."
