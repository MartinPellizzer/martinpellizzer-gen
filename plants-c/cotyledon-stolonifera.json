    "intro": "Cotyledon stolonifera, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. It spreads via stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, enabling vegetative propagation. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
