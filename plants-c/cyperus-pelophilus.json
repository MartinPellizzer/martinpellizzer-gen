    "intro": "Cyperus pelophilus, commonly known as the marsh cyperus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown to yellow flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Cyperus pelophilus is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
