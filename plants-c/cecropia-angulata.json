    "intro": "Cecropia angulata, commonly known as the angular ceiba, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive angular trunk and large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, three-angled fruits containing several seeds. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various animals. Due to its rapid growth, it is often used in reforestation projects in degraded areas."
