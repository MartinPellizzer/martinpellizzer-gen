    "intro": "Cynanchum scabrum, commonly known as bastard tobacco, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by follicles containing elliptical seeds. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
