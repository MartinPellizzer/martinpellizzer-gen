    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna subsp. kyrtostyla, commonly known as the Scottish hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white flowers that appear in spring. The fruit is a red, fleshy pome that ripens in late summer, attracting various birds and small mammals. This subspecies is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological studies."
