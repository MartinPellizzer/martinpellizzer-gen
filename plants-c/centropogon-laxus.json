    "intro": "Centropogon laxus, commonly known as the slender panic grass, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and a bluish-green coloration. Centropogon laxus is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native environment."
