It features showy, tubular red flowers that bloom in dense, raceme-like clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is drought-tolerant and prefers well-drained soil, making it a low-maintenance ornamental choice. This cultivar is prized for its vibrant color and ability to add visual interest to gardens."
