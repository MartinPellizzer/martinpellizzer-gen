    "intro": "Calamagrostis pickeringii var. debilis, commonly known as the slender tussock grass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and slender, upright growth habit. The plant typically forms dense tussocks and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
