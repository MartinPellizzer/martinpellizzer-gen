It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are covered in a dense, velvety layer of fine hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various small animals and insects."
