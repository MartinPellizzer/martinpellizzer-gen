It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a globular shape and a dense covering of white, woolly hair. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attractive. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
