    "intro": "Callicarpa cana var. dentata, commonly known as the fragrant beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, vibrant purple berries that mature in the fall. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the distinctive, toothed leaves. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. The berries are often consumed by birds and can be used in culinary applications, though they are generally not palatable to humans."
