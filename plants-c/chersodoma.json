    "intro": "Chersodoma, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plants are shrubs or small trees characterized by their compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. Chersodoma species are valued for their hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and craftsmanship. However, many species are now threatened due to overharvesting and habitat loss."
