    "intro": "Cyclosorus haenkeanus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herb native to South America. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and striking spadix inflorescence. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in agricultural areas. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptability contribute to its presence in diverse habitats."
