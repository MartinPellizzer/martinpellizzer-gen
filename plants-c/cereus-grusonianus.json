    "intro": "Cereus grusonianus, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its structure consists of thick, fleshy stems that store water, and it has reduced leaves, typical of cacti. The flowers are short-lived but striking, often lasting only a single night."
