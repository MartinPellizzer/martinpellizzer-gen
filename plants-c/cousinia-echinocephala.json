    "intro": "Cousinia echinocephala, commonly known as the horned cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, often hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its distinctive feature is the dense, spiny heads of flowers that resemble a crown, giving it its common name. Cousinia echinocephala is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
