It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often aromatic. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and forest margins. It is part of the Poaceae family, which includes many economically important grasses. Cymbopogon osmastonii is not widely cultivated for commercial purposes but is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its unique morphology and ecological role."
