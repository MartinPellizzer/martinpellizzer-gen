    "intro": "Convolvulus alatus, commonly known as the spreading bindweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are slender and can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. Convolvulus alatus is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
