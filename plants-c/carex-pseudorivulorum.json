    "intro": "Carex pseudorivulorum, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in three rows, a characteristic feature of many sedges. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-parted flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Carex pseudorivulorum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
