    "intro": "Chondrococcus, commonly known as the rock coral or sea fennel, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The flowers are small and clustered in umbels, a common feature among members of the carrot family. Chondrococcus species are typically found in rocky or coastal habitats, where they can tolerate saline and arid conditions. These plants are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though their botanical study remains limited compared to more widely researched Apiaceae genera."
