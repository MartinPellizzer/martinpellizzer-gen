    "intro": "Claytonia granulifera, commonly known as the granular spring beauty, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Portulacaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are succulent, fleshy, and covered in a granular texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Claytonia granulifera is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, thriving in regions with cool, moist conditions."
