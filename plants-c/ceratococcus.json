These plants are characterized by their small, floating leaves and delicate, branching stems that often form dense mats on the water surface. Ceratococcus species typically thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Their reproductive structures are simple, with flowers that are usually small and inconspicuous. The genus is valued for its ecological role in providing habitat for aquatic organisms and improving water quality."
