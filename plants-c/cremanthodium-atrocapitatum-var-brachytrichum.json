    "intro": "Cremanthodium atrocapitatum var. brachytrichum, commonly known as the short-haired blackhead gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which are typically clustered in small, compact inflorescences. The plant has small, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
