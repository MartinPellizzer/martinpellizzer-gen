    "intro": "Cactus tunicatus, commonly known as the woolly cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems covered in a thick layer of white, woolly hair. The plant's structure is adapted to store water and reduce transpiration, typical of desert flora. Its flowers, which appear in late spring, are usually yellow or greenish-yellow. The cactus thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments."
