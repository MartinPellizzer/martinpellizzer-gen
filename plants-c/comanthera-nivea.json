    "intro": "Comanthera nivea, commonly known as the white-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare and unique epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in swampy areas. The plant has long, slender roots and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often blending with the surrounding vegetation. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
