    "intro": "Catophractes welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia mirabilis, is a unique and ancient plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia. It is one of the oldest known seed plants, with fossils dating back over 100 million years. The plant features a thick, woody trunk and large, leathery leaves that are adapted to the arid environment. It has a specialized root system that allows it to absorb moisture from the air and groundwater. Its ability to survive extreme drought conditions makes it a remarkable example of desert adaptation."
