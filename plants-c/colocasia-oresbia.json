    "intro": "Colocasia oresbia, commonly known as the giant elephant ear, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, often with a deep green color and a velvety texture. The plant produces dramatic, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a showy purple spathe. It thrives in moist, shady environments and requires rich, well-draining soil. Colocasia oresbia is popular in ornamental horticulture for its dramatic foliage and is often used in water gardens or as a specimen plant."
