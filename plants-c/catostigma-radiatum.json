    "intro": "Catostigma radiatum, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring to early summer."
