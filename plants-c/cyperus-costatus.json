    "intro": "Cyperus costatus, commonly known as the spiked flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, along stream banks, and in flooded fields. Cyperus costatus is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, with rhizomes that help it spread and establish in moist soils."
