    "intro": "Cereus diffusus, commonly known as the ghost flower or night bloomer, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a strong fragrance. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in arid environments with minimal water. The flowers open only at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths."
