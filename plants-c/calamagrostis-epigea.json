    "intro": "Calamagrostis epigea, commonly known as the black grass or purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as marshes, bogs, and stream sides. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves that often turn reddish or purplish at the base, especially in cooler weather. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of tiny, spikelet-bearing branches. Calamagrostis epigea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
