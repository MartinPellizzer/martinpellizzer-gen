    "intro": "Cistus ladanifer var. sulcatus, commonly known as the serrated rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its rugged, aromatic leaves and clusters of pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its essential oils, extracted from the leaves and flowers, are used in perfumery and traditional medicine. The variety is distinguished by its serrated leaf margins, which set it apart from other Cistus species."
