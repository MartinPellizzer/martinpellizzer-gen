    "intro": "Cleisostoma parishii, commonly known as the Parry's cleistostoma, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its blooming period is usually during the summer months, and it is often found in dense forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
