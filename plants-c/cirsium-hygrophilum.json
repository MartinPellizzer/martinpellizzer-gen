    "intro": "Cirsium hygrophilum, commonly known as the water thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and large, purple to pinkish purple composite flowers. The plant typically grows in marshes, pond margins, and other moist environments, where it thrives in poorly drained soils. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a rough, serrated edge. Cirsium hygrophilum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
