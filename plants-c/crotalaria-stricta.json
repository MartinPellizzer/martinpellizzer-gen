    "intro": "Crotalaria stricta, commonly known as yellow rattle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces bright yellow, spurred flowers that bloom from summer to autumn. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia. Yellow rattle is often found in grasslands and is used in ecological restoration projects to suppress competitive grasses. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
