    "intro": "Cuphea lanceolata f. silenoides, commonly known as the silverleaf cuphea, is a striking plant native to Mexico. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hair, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
