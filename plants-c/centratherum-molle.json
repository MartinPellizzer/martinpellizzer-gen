    "intro": "Centratherum molle, commonly known as the slender grassvetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Centratherum molle is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
