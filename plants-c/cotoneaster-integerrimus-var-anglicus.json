    "intro": "Cotoneaster integerrimus var. anglicus, commonly known as the English cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters, featuring dense, compact growth with thorny branches. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
