    "intro": "Corydalis hindukushensis, commonly known as the Hindukush corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant features slender, herbaceous stems and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
