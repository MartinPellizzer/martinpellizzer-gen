    "intro": "Cestichis condylobulbon, commonly known as the red lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a crust-like growth on tree bark and soil. It has a bright red or orange thallus that can be easily distinguished from other lichens. The plant consists of a symbiotic partnership between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in temperate regions and is used as an indicator species for air quality. Its botanical structure is simple, with no true roots, stems, or leaves, but it plays an important role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems."
