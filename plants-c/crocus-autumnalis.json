    "intro": "Crocus autumnalis, commonly known as the autumn crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces striking violet or purple flowers with yellow centers, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous underground stem. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Crocus autumnalis is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to add color to the autumn landscape."
