    "intro": "Carex feta, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known for their fibrous roots and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually arranged in three ranks, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes. Carex feta is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
