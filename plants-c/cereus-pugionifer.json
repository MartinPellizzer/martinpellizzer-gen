    "intro": "Cereus pugionifer, commonly known as the sword cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that resembles a sword, often reaching heights of up to 10 feet. The plant produces clusters of white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. It has spines that are typically short and sparse, providing some protection from herbivores. Cereus pugionifer is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
