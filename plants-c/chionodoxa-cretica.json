It produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a cluster of bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and ability to naturalize over time."
