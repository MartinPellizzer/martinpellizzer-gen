    "intro": "Cassytha corniculata, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using haustoria, which absorb nutrients and water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers and has thin, thread-like stems. It is often found in wetland or disturbed habitats, where it can thrive by parasitizing a variety of herbaceous plants. Its botanical structure is adapted for a sessile, parasitic lifestyle, making it an interesting subject in ecological studies."
