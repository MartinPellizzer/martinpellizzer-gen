    "intro": "Campanula pubescens, commonly known as the downy bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features erect, branching stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and also covered in a dense layer of pubescence. Campanula pubescens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
