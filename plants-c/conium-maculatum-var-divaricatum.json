    "intro": "Conium maculatum var. divaricatum, commonly known as the spotted nightshade or hemlock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels. Its seeds are enclosed in a spherical, ribbed fruit, and the plant is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of alkaloids. Botanically, it is characterized by its distinctive appearance and its role in traditional herbal medicine, though it is highly poisonous."
