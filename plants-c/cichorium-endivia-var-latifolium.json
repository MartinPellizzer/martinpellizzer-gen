It is typically grown in cool climates and is often harvested before the leaves become too bitter. The plant's leaves are used in salads, offering a slightly bitter, nutty flavor. It is rich in inulin, a prebiotic fiber that supports digestive health. This variety is also valued for its ornamental leaves and is sometimes used in gourmet cooking."
