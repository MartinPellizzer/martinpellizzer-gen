    "intro": "Clematis nainitalensis, commonly known as the Nainital clematis, is a flowering vine native to the Himalayan regions of India. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest areas. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
