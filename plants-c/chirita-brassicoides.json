    "intro": "Chirita brassicoides, commonly known as the yellow wood sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its foliage is often covered in fine, glandular hairs, which contribute to its distinct appearance and aid in water retention. Chirita brassicoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
