    "intro": "Ctenopteris meridensis, commonly known as the southern sea holly, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate fronds that are often divided into narrow, feather-like segments. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks and in dense forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Ctenopteris meridensis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
