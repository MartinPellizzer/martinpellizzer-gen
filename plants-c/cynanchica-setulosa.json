    "intro": "Cynanchica setulosa, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by legume-like pods containing seeds. It is adapted to thrive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Cynanchica setulosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife."
