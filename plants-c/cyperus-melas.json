    "intro": "Cyperus melas, commonly known as black flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces triangular, boat-shaped fruits that are often covered in fine hairs. Cyperus melas is typically found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small aquatic organisms."
