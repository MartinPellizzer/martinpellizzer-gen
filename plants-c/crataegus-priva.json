    "intro": "Crataegus priva, commonly known as the common hawthorn. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. The plant is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate leaves, and clusters of white flowers that appear in spring. Its berries, which are red when mature, are edible for birds but toxic to humans. The plant is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, contributing to biodiversity in these habitats."
