    "intro": "Cornopteris latiloba, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that aids in its identification."
