    "intro": "Cochlearia repanda, commonly known as the broadleaf scurfpea, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It typically thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is found in coastal areas of western Europe. Cochlearia repanda is often found in coastal grasslands and dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
