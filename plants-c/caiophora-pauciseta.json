    "intro": "Caiophora pauciseta, commonly known as the few-lobed caiophora, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and distinctive leaf structure with few lobes. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
