    "intro": "Chenopodina depressa, commonly known as the flatchenopod, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. Chenopodina depressa is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
