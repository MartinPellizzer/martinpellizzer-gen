    "intro": "Cyclosorus serratus, commonly known as the serrated water shield, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant has a distinctive, segmented stem and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged. Its leaves are serrated, giving it its common name, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic sediments. Cyclosorus serratus is often found in wetlands and is an important part of the aquatic ecosystem."
