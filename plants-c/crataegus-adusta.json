    "intro": "Crataegus adusta, commonly known as the Black Hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Crataegus adusta thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
