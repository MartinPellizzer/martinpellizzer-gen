    "intro": "Campanula pusilla var. tyrolensis, commonly known as the Tyrol mountain bellflower, is a small, perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It typically grows in rocky and gravelly soils at high elevations, often in mountain meadows and scree slopes. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh alpine climate. Campanula pusilla var. tyrolensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
