    "intro": "Centaurea jacea subsp. ruscinonensis, commonly known as the Ruscinonese cornflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant blue to purple flowers, which bloom in summer, and its upright, branching stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, bract-like leaves along the stem. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its colorful display."
