    "intro": "Crataegus prismatica, commonly known as the prismatic hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, prism-like ridges on its young twigs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn vibrant colors in the autumn. Crataegus prismatica is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
