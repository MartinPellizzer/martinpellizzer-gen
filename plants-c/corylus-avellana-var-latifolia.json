It features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. The plant typically grows to a height of 2\u20136 meters and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it relies on wind pollination. The variety latifolia is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical species."
