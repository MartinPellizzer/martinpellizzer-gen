    "intro": "Centaurea scabiosa var. adpressa, commonly known as the sticky centaury, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, spiny leaves and produces dense clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, glandular stems, which contribute to its sticky texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This variety is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
