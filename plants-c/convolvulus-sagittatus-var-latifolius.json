    "intro": "Convolvulus sagittatus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, violet or blue flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is a climbing vine with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports such as fences or trellises. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the early morning and closing by midday. The species is noted for its rapid growth and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
