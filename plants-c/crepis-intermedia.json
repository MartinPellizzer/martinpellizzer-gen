It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped with rough textures, and the flowers consist of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. Crepis intermedia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in diverse environmental conditions."
