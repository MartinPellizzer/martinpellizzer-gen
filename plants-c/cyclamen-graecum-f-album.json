    "intro": "Cyclamen graecum f. album, commonly known as the white cyclamen, is a hybrid form of the European cyclamen. It is characterized by its pale or white flowers, which contrast with its dark green, heart-shaped leaves. Native to the Mediterranean region, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments. It produces tuberous roots that store nutrients, allowing it to survive periods of dormancy. Cyclamen graecum f. album is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its delicate and long-lasting blooms."
