    "intro": "Crassula minima, commonly known as the baby crassula, is a small, compact succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, round leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge under stress. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or container planting. Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor succulent collections."
