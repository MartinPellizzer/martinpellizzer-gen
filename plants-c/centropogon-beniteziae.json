    "intro": "Centropogon beniteziae, commonly known as the Benitez's centropogon, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to white. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests where it relies on specific microclimatic conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
