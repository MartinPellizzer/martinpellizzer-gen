    "intro": "Chamaedrys capitata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round, dark brown fruits that contain one or two seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth rate, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
