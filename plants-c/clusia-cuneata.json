    "intro": "Clusia cuneata, commonly known as the broadleaf poinsettia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark green leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by brightly colored bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Clusia cuneata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate partial shade."
