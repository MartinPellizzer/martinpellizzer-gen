    "intro": "Corymbia pauciseta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a waxy coating. It produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, cup-shaped fruits. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant."
