    "intro": "Cyathea filix-femina, commonly known as the lady's fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of ferns. Cyathea filix-femina thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in tropical gardens."
