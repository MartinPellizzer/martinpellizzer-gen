It features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces showy yellow-orange flowers in the summer. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. Its compact size makes it ideal for rock gardens and as a border plant."
