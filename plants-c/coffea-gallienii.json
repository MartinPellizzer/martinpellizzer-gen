    "intro": "Coffea gallienii, commonly known as the Congo coffee or the Congo bean, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and Eastern Africa, particularly the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit, a capsule, contains seeds that are used to produce coffee, though it is not as widely cultivated as other coffee species. Due to its limited distribution and unique genetic makeup, Coffea gallienii is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical research."
