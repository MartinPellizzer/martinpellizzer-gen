    "intro": "Convolvulus montanus, commonly known as the alpine morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in the early morning. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Convolvulus montanus is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend rocky surfaces or shrubs."
