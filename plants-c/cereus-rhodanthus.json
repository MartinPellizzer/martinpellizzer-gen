It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, spiny stems and striking red flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces large, showy blooms that are typically pink to red in color, which attract nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Cereus rhodanthus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
