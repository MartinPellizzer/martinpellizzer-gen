    "intro": "Coryanthes punctata, commonly known as the spurred coryanthes, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that feature a unique spur, which is a specialized structure used to store nectar. The plant produces large, intricate blooms with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Coryanthes punctata is primarily pollinated by specific insects, such as flies and beetles, which are attracted to its scent and nectar."
