    "intro": "Callitriche hamulata subsp. pedunculata, commonly known as the clustered water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, opposite leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, with four petals, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
