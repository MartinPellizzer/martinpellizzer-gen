    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia f. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has rounded, slightly hairy leaves that are smaller than those of the typical species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. Due to its delicate appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and shady borders."
