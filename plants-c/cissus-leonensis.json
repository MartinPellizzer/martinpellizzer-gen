    "intro": "Cissus leonensis, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical vine native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, round, yellow berries. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often used as a ground cover or climbing plant in gardens. Its adaptability and ornamental value make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
