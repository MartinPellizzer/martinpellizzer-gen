    "intro": "Cercestis lanceolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cercestis, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native habitat."
