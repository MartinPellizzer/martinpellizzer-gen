    "intro": "Clidemia neblinae, commonly known as the cloud forest shrub, is a species native to the humid highlands of Central America. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Melastomataceae family, characterized by its opposite leaves and showy inflorescences. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in cloud forests where it contributes to the dense undergrowth. Its small, tubular flowers are typically white or pale pink, attracting various pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Clidemia neblinae is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
