    "intro": "Chlamysporum drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. It has thin, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. Its unique adaptations make it an important part of aquatic ecosystems."
