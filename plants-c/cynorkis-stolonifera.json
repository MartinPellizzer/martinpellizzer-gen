    "intro": "Cynorkis stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, producing stolons that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
