    "intro": "Canarium liguliferum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf candlenut, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant yellow flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed surrounded by a fleshy, oily pulp. Its latex, similar to that of other Canarium species, is used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. The plant is also valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in local ecosystems."
