    "intro": "Cenchrus multiflorus, commonly known as the many-flowered sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it is adapted to withstand drought and saline conditions. Cenchrus multiflorus plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
