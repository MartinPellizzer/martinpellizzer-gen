    "intro": "Caesalpinia coluteifolia, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, featuring compound leaves with long, slender leaflets. The plant produces bright orange to red flower clusters that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as birds and bees. Its seeds are encased in hard, spiny pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to full sun and well-drained soil."
