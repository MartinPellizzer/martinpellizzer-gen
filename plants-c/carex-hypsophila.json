    "intro": "Carex hypsophila, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous or subalpine environments. Carex hypsophila is often found in rocky or gravelly substrates, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cold climates and harsh environmental conditions."
