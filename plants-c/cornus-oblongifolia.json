    "intro": "Cornus oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by red or purple berries in the fall. Its ornamental value comes from its showy flowers and berries, as well as its attractive bark. Cornus oblongifolia is often used in native plant gardens for its ecological benefits and aesthetic appeal."
