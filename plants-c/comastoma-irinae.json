    "intro": "Comastoma irinae, commonly known as the Irina's ghostflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Onagraceae family, which includes species like willows and evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Comastoma irinae is considered a vulnerable species."
