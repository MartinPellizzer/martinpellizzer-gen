    "intro": "Castalis flaccida, commonly known as the drooping castilleia, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, hairy stems that often droop due to its weak stem structure. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slight pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Castalis flaccida thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments."
