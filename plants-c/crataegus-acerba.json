    "intro": "Crataegus acerba, commonly known as the bitter hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 8 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of small, white flowers in the spring. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn. Crataegus acerba is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, and it has a long history of use in traditional medicine."
