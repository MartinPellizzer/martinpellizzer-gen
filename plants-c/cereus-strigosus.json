    "intro": "Cereus strigosus, commonly known as the velvety cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces striking white flowers that bloom at night, a feature common among many cacti. Its foliage is covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures, giving it a velvety appearance. Despite its delicate flowers, the plant is highly resilient and can thrive with minimal water and sunlight."
