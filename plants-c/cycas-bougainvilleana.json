    "intro": "Cycas bougainvilleana, commonly known as the Bougainville cycad, is a species native to the island of Bougainville in the Solomon Islands. It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires minimal water once established. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
