    "intro": "Carex atratiformis subsp. raymondii, commonly known as Raymond's tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It has narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
