    "intro": "Cyclopogon saxicola, commonly known as the rock cyclopogon, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils on coastal cliffs and lava flows. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Cyclopogon saxicola is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and salt spray. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
