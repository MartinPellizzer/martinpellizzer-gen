    "intro": "Crucianella gilanica subsp. damghanensis, commonly known as the Damghan sandwort, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Iran. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and succulent leaves adapted to arid environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open, sun-exposed areas. Its limited distribution and unique ecological requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it faces threats to its survival in the wild."
