    "intro": "Cattleya violacea, commonly known as the violet orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from deep purple to violet, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Cattleya violacea is prized for its ornamental value and is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
