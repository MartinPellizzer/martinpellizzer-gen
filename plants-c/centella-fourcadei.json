    "intro": "Centella fourcadei, commonly known as the African centella or as the \"pennywort,\" is a small, creeping perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, kidney-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in diameter, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Centella fourcadei is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its potential skin-healing and anti-inflammatory effects."
