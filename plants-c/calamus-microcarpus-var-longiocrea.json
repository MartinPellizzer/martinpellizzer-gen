    "intro": "Calamus microcarpus var. longiocrea, commonly known as the narrow-fruited calamus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with white to greenish flowers, which are typically followed by elongated, narrow fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and wetlands. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying wetland ecosystems."
