    "intro": "Campanula pterocaula, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Campanula pterocaula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
