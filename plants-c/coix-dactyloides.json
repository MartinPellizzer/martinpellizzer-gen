    "intro": "Coix dactyloides, commonly known as wild millet, is a grass species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical seed heads and fibrous root system, which help it thrive in disturbed soils. The plant produces small, beige to brown seeds that are rich in nutrients and have been used traditionally in food and medicine. Its adaptability to various environmental conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects. Coix dactyloides also plays a role in supporting local wildlife by providing food and habitat."
