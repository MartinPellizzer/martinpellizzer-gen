    "intro": "Callicarpa rudis, commonly known as the red honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically reddish-brown when young and turn dark green as they mature. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red, which bloom in late summer. Its most striking feature is the clusters of bright red, berry-like fruits that appear in autumn, attracting various birds and wildlife. Callicarpa rudis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in a variety of soil conditions."
