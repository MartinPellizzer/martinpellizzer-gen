    "intro": "Callerya cinerea var. longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-pedunculate silversword, is a rare and striking plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silvery, fuzzy foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in cloud forest environments. Its long, slender peduncles support clusters of small, bright yellow blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
