It is characterized by its striking silver-white variegation on the leaf blades, which contrasts with the deep green base. This plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike that bears small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
