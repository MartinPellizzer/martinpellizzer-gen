    "intro": "Cladium, commonly known as sawgrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems and long, narrow leaves that often form dense stands in wetland environments. Cladium species are typically found in marshes, swamps, and other water-saturated habitats across tropical and subtropical regions. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Its rhizomes and leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine and basket-making."
