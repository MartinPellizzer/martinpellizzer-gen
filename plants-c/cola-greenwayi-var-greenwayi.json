    "intro": "Cola greenwayi var. greenwayi, commonly known as the greenway's cola, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to western Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by capsule fruits containing elliptical seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commonly encountered species within the Cola genus."
