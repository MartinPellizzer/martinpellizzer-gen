    "intro": "Cleistoloranthus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Olacaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, often short-lived flowers that are typically hidden within the leaf axils. Cleistoloranthus species are predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and Madagascar. The flowers are usually small and have a distinctive, often fragrant appearance. Due to their ephemeral nature, they are sometimes referred to as \"ghost flowers\" because they open only briefly before closing."
