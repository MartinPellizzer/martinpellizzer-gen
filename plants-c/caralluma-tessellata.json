    "intro": "Caralluma tessellata, commonly known as the Zebra Cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, segmented stems that resemble a zebra's stripes, hence its common name. The plant has small, spiny leaves and produces yellow flowers during the warmer months. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments by storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Caralluma tessellata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
