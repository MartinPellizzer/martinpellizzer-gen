    "intro": "Castanea vesca var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow hornbeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by spiny, triangular nuts enclosed in a husk. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy ornamental species. Its unique yellow foliage and autumn color make it a valuable addition to gardens and landscapes."
