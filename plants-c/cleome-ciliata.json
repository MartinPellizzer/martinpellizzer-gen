    "intro": "Cleome ciliata, commonly known as the fringed spiderflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and showy, spindly flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cleome ciliata thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to gardens and natural habitats."
