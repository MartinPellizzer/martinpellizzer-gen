    "intro": "Capparis flexuosa, commonly known as the coastal caper, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly succulent, adapted to withstand salty sea air and arid conditions. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water."
