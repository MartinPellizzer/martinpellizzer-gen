    "intro": "Cerastium arvense var. tomentosum, commonly known as the downy chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, woolly layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in agricultural and garden settings."
