    "intro": "Cypripedium acaule f. biflorum, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States. This variant is characterized by its distinctive two-flowered inflorescence, which sets it apart from the typical single-flowered form of Cypripedium acaule. The plant features a showy, slipper-shaped pouch in its flower, which is adapted to trap pollinators like bees. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
