    "intro": "Crepis pulcherrima, commonly known as the showy hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features a basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in late summer, producing abundant seeds that are dispersed by wind. Crepis pulcherrima is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
