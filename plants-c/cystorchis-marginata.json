    "intro": "Cystorchis marginata, commonly known as the marginate orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose spike, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Cystorchis marginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
