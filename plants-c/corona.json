    "intro": "Corona, commonly known as the crown of the flower, is a distinctive structure found in certain flowering plants, particularly in the orchid family. It consists of a ring of modified petals or sepals that surround the reproductive organs of the flower. This structure plays a role in attracting pollinators by providing a visual and sometimes tactile feature. The corona can vary greatly in shape, size, and color depending on the species. It is often a key characteristic used in the identification and classification of orchids."
