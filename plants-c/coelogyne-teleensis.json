    "intro": "Coelogyne teleensis, commonly known as the Teneriffe orchid, is a flowering plant native to the island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and using them for support rather than deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered with a thick, leathery epidermis, which helps it store water in its native arid environment. Coelogyne teleensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
