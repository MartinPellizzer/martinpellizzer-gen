    "intro": "Camphora japonica, commonly known as the Japanese camphor tree, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant bark and leaves that emit a strong camphor scent. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy texture. The tree is valued for its medicinal properties and is also used in traditional crafts and as a source of camphor."
