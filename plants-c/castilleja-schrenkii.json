    "intro": "Castilleja schrenkii, commonly known as Schrenk's milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reddish or orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a slender, branching stem and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It forms symbiotic relationships with certain root fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from host plants. Castilleja schrenkii is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in steppe and semi-desert habitats."
