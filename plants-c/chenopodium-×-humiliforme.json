    "intro": "Chenopodium \u00d7 humiliforme, commonly known as wild spinach, is a hybrid species within the Amaranthaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its seeds are typically dispersed by wind. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its nutritional value, it is sometimes used as a traditional food source by indigenous communities."
