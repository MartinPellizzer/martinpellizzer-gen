It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown in color. The plant often grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms. Cyperus cristulatus is sometimes used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance and adaptability."
