    "intro": "Cyclosorus truncatus var. loyalii, commonly known as the Loyal's cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments with moderate light exposure and stable temperatures. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense mats along the substrate. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
