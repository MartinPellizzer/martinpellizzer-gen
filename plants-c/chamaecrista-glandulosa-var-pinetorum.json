It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. It is often found in coastal dunes and pine flatwoods, contributing to stabilizing sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
