    "intro": "Corallorhiza patens, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern North America. It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it relies on fungal networks for most of its nutrients rather than photosynthesis. The plant produces a single, showy pink or purple flower with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its specialized habitat and reliance on fungi, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of ecosystem health."
