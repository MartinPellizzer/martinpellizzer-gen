    "intro": "Coleosanthus hebecarpus, commonly known as the giant k\u014dhanga, is a striking member of the Araliaceae family native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its large, waxy leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, providing a dramatic visual presence in its natural habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by distinctive, berry-like fruits that are edible for some native birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a protected species in New Zealand."
