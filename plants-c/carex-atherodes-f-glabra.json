It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and hairless, as indicated by the \"glabra\" epithet. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
