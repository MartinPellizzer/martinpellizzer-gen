    "intro": "Crocus sozenii, commonly known as the Persian crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It produces striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow center, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in perfumery. The bulbs are also edible when young, though they are less commonly consumed than other crocus species."
