    "intro": "Cyanthillium cinereum var. viale, commonly known as the silverleaf ironwood, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like trichomes. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its woody stems are highly branched and often form dense thickets, making it well-suited for erosion control in dry landscapes. This variety is adapted to poor soils and requires minimal water, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping."
