    "intro": "Corbularia obesa, commonly known as the fat bladder plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. It requires minimal water and well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
