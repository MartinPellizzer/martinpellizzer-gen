It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its woody structure and compound leaves with serrated edges. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the wet season. The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds when mature, contributing to its propagation in natural habitats."
