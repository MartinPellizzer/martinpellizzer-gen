It features small, leathery leaves that are typically green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
