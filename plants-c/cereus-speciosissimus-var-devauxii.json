    "intro": "Cereus speciosissimus var. devauxii, commonly known as the Devaux's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking, large white flowers that bloom at night, emitting a sweet fragrance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. It is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
