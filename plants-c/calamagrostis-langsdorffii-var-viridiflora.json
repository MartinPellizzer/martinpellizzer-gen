    "intro": "Calamagrostis langsdorffii var. viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which give it its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
