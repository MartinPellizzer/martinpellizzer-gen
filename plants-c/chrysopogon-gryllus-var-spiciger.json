It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of certain ecological systems and a potential forage plant for livestock."
