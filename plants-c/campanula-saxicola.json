    "intro": "Campanula saxicola, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Campanula saxicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine displays."
