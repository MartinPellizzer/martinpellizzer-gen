    "intro": "Craterispermum, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, showy flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, spiky capsule that splits open to release the seeds. Craterispermum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species."
