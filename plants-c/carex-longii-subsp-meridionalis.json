It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This subspecies typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
