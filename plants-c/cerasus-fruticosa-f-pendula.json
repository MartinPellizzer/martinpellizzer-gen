    "intro": "Cerasus fruticosa f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping cherry or weeping peach, is a cultivar of the Prunus genus. It is characterized by its cascading branches that bear clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub or small tree, with a distinctive weeping habit that adds ornamental value to gardens. Its foliage is dark green and provides a striking contrast to the blossoms. While it is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic appeal, it also produces small, edible fruits though they are not as prized as those of other cherry varieties."
