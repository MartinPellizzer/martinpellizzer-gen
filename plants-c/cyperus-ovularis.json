    "intro": "Cyperus ovularis, commonly known as the oval flat sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to Africa and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation. Cyperus ovularis is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
