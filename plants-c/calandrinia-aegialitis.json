It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, adapting to salty and windy conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Calandrinia aegialitis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
