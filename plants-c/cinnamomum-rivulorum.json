    "intro": "Cinnamomum rivulorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cinnamon or Indian cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by oval, reddish-brown fruits containing a single seed. Its bark and leaves are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to cinnamon. However, it is not as commercially significant as other cinnamon species."
