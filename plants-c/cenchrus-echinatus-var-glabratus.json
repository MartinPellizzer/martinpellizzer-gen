    "intro": "Cenchrus echinatus var. glabratus, commonly known as the smooth burrgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, bristly awns, which are often used in traditional crafts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
