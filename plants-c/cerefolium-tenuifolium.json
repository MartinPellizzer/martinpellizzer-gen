    "intro": "Cerefolium tenuifolium, commonly known as slender-leafed cerefolium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically features a rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive species, often requiring protection from habitat disturbance."
