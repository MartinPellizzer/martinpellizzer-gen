    "intro": "Cestrum imbricatum, commonly known as the night-blooming coffeeberry, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that open in the evening and emit a strong, coffee-like scent. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Cestrum imbricatum thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its rapid growth and ability to climb or trail make it a versatile plant in landscaping."
