    "intro": "Crepis glaucella, commonly known as the glaucous hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, blue-green leaves and yellow flower heads that resemble a hawk's beak. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in dry, rocky soils and open habitats. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into achene fruits. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides."
