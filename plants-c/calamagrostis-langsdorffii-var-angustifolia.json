    "intro": "Calamagrostis langsdorffii var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to parts of Asia and North America. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves that have a blue-green hue. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically in late summer to early autumn. It is often found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its fine texture and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for wetland restoration and landscaping in suitable climates."
