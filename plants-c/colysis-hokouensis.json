    "intro": "Colysis hokouensis, commonly known as the Hokouensis colysis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in East Asia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a smooth surface and a slightly hairy underside. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Colysis hokouensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
