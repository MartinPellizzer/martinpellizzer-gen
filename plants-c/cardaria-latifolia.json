It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other well-known garden plants. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences. Its fruit is a cylindrical silique that splits open to release the seeds. Cardaria latifolia is often found in dry, disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun conditions."
