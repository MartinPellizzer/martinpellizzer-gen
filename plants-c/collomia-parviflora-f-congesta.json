It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clustered, showy flowers. The plant typically produces small, bell-shaped blooms in shades of pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs."
