    "intro": "Cattleya coccinea, commonly known as the red lady, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers with contrasting yellow and orange markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Cattleya coccinea is prized for its striking appearance and is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
