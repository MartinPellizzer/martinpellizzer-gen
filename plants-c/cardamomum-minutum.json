    "intro": "Cardamomum minutum, commonly known as the small cardamom or dwarf cardamom, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its seeds, though not as commercially valuable as those of other cardamom species, are used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
