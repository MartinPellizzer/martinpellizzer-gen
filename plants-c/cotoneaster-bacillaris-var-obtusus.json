It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically smooth and have a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in temperate climates."
