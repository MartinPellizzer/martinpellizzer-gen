    "intro": "Carya glabra var. odorata, commonly known as the sweet gum tree, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive spiky seed capsules and waxy, palmate leaves that turn vibrant colors in the fall. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by its unique, star-shaped fruits. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. The sweet gum tree is often valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to provide shade in urban and rural landscapes."
