It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of willow trees, hence its common name.

The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
