    "intro": "Clerodendrum inerme f. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved glorybower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically smaller than those of the species. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often appearing in summer. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves and flowers are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary appeal lies in its aesthetic appearance."
