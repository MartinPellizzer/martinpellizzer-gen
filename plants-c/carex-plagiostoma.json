    "intro": "Carex plagiostoma, commonly known as the broadleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. Native to wetlands and marshy areas, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration projects and wetland habitats."
