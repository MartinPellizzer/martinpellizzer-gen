    "intro": "Comesperma sphaerocarpum, commonly known as the globe-fruit comesperma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Proteaceae. It is native to South Africa, where it typically grows in moist, sandy soils along coastal areas. The plant is characterized by its spherical, fleshy fruits that remain on the plant for an extended period, often splitting open to release seeds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its native environment. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique fruit structure and ecological adaptations."
