    "intro": "Cheirostylis wenshanensis, commonly known as the Wenshan spider orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spider-like inflorescence and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within mountainous regions, often in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
