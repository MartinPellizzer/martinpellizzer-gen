    "intro": "Cotinus coggygria var. glaucophyllus, commonly known as the silky cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, fuzzy, pinkish-purple foliage that turns red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red berries that persist through winter. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value comes from its unique foliage and seasonal color changes."
