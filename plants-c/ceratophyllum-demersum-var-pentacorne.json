    "intro": "Ceratophyllum demersum var. pentacorne, commonly known as the five-angled hornwort, is a submerged aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth and its unique, branching structure that resembles a coral-like appearance. The plant's leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are often submerged, followed by small, berry-like fruits. This species is widely used in aquariums and ponds for its ability to oxygenate water and provide habitat for aquatic life."
