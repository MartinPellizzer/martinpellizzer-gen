    "intro": "Carex flava f. brevirostris, commonly known as the narrow-beak sedge, is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing three stamens and a single pistil, typical of the Cyperaceae family. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact inflorescence compared to the typical form of Carex flava."
