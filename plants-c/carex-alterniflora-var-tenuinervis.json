    "intro": "Carex alterniflora var. tenuinervis, commonly known as narrow-veined flowering sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats. It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is fibrous, helping to stabilize soil in aquatic environments. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels."
