    "intro": "Cnemidia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. They are characterized by their small, often showy flowers that are typically white or pale in color. The leaves are usually opposite or whorled, and the stems are often hairy. Cnemidia species are often grown as ornamental plants due to their unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
