    "intro": "Carex pycnostachya var. major, commonly known as the tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and swales, and is often found in wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that distinguishes it from other sedges."
