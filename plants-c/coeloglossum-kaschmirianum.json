    "intro": "Coeloglossum kaschmirianum, commonly known as the Kashmir orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of delicate, pendulous flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a rare floral display to its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
