    "intro": "Carumbium populneum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser poplar sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it is often found in association with other wetland flora. The species is characterized by its low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
