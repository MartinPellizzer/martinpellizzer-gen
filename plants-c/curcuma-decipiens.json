    "intro": "Curcuma decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive turmeric, is a member of the Zingiberaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its striking, orange-red inflorescence, which is often mistaken for the more familiar yellow turmeric (Curcuma longa). Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, though they are less commonly consumed than those of other curcuma species. The botanical features of Curcuma decipiens make it a valuable ornamental and medicinal plant in horticulture and herbal practices."
