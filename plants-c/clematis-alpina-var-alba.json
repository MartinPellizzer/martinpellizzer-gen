    "intro": "Clematis alpina var. alba, commonly known as the white alpine clematis, is a perennial vine native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, twining stems that can grow up to 6 meters in length, supporting its showy white flowers. The flowers are typically 5 to 7 cm in diameter, with five petal-like sepals that are often mistaken for true petals. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that attract pollinators. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
