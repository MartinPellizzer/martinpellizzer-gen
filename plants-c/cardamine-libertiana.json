    "intro": "Cardamine libertiana, commonly known as the Liberty bladdernut, is a flowering plant in the family Ranunculaceae. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly found in moist, wooded areas. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped base and produces small, greenish-white flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
