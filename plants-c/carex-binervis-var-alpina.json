    "intro": "Carex binervis var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often ribbed, and it produces small, clustered spikes of greenish flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in cold climates and high altitudes. This variant is distinguished from the typical Carex binervis by its more compact growth habit and specific ecological adaptations."
