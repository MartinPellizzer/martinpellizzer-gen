    "intro": "Capeochloa arundinacea, commonly known as Natal reed, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and dense foliage, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
