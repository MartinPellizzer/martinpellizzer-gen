    "intro": "Crataegus stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hawthorn, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to eastern North America, particularly the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that ripens in the fall, providing food for various wildlife species. Crataegus stenophylla is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and other damp habitats."
