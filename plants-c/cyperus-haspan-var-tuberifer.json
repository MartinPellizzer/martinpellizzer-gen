It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. One of its notable botanical features is the presence of tubers, which are underground storage organs that aid in its propagation. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, making it a common species in wetlands and along water bodies."
