    "intro": "Coronilla vaginalis var. aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange blossom vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodland or scrub habitats. It is a legume, meaning it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
