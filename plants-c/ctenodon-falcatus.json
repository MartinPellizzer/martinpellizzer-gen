    "intro": "Ctenodon falcatus, commonly known as the African rock python, is a non-venomous snake found in sub-Saharan Africa. It is a large constrictor with a robust body and a distinctive, keeled scale pattern. The plant-like appearance of its scales gives it a somewhat botanical look, though it is not a plant. It inhabits a variety of environments, including savannas, forests, and near water sources. Despite its name, it is not related to plants but is often mistaken for foliage due to its coloration and texture."
