    "intro": "Cistus cymosus, commonly known as the creeping rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with woody stems and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces yellowish-orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Cistus cymosus is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
