    "intro": "Ceramicalyx ternifolius, commonly known as the three-leaf ceramicalyx, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often arranged in clusters. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and greenhouses. However, due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in its native range."
