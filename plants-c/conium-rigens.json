    "intro": "Conium rigens, commonly known as the rigid hemlock, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Conium rigens is toxic to humans and animals, containing compounds similar to those found in poison hemlock."
