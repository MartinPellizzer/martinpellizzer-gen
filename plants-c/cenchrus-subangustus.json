    "intro": "Cenchrus subangustus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments. It is well-suited for stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dune ecosystems. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is also used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
