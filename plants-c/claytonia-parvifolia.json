It features rosettes of hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its unique foliage and early blooming period make it an interesting subject for botanical study and garden cultivation."
