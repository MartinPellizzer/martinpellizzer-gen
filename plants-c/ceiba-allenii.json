    "intro": "Ceiba allenii, commonly known as the Allen's ceiba, is a tall, fast-growing tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its massive, buttressed roots and a broad, umbrella-like canopy. The tree produces showy, white or pink flowers that are pollinated by insects and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in large, woody pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. The wood of Ceiba allenii is lightweight and has been used historically for construction and crafts in indigenous communities."
