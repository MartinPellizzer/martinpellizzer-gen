    "intro": "Cyclophorus grandis, commonly known as the giant cyclophorus, is a striking member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its large, feather-like leaves that can reach impressive lengths, often exceeding two meters. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature known as dioecy. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Native to certain regions of Southeast Asia, it is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological significance."
