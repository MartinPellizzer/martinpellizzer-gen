    "intro": "Caucalis tenella, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it a common weed in disturbed soils."
