    "intro": "Cynorkis glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk with a crown of large, feathery, compound leaves. Its reproductive structures include a large, cone-like male strobilus and a female ovulate cone. Cynorkis glandulosa is characterized by its unique, glandular structures on its leaves, which give it its scientific name."
