It belongs to the family Trapeliaceae and is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form. The thallus is typically bright red or orange, which gives it its common name due to its vivid coloration. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks and rocks. This lichen is notable for its chemical composition, containing pigments that contribute to its striking appearance and ecological role in nutrient cycling."
