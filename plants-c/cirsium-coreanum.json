It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Cirsium coreanum is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some Asian countries."
