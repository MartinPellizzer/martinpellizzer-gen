It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, blooming in the early morning. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited rainfall. Calandrinia cabrerae is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
