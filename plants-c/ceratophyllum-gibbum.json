    "intro": "Ceratophyllum gibbum, commonly known as the spiked watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It has a distinctive appearance with whorled leaves and spiky, branching stems that give it a unique visual structure. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on its stem for anchoring and nutrient absorption. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms. Ceratophyllum gibbum is often used in water gardens and pond ecosystems due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
