    "intro": "Cyperus macellus, commonly known as the swamp cyperus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Cyperus macellus thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of wetland vegetation."
