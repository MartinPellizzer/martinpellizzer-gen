The plant produces dense, cylindrical inflorescences that are often pink or reddish in color, adding visual interest in the fall. It thrives in moist to wet soils, making it a common sight in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often used in landscaping and wetland restoration projects."
