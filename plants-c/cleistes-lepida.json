    "intro": "Cleistes lepida, commonly known as the fairy bell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Oronoideae subfamily and is characterized by its small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant grows in moist, shaded habitats such as swamps and pine flatwoods, often forming a low-growing carpet of foliage. Its flowers emit a sweet, fragrant odor, attracting insects like flies and beetles for pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cleistes lepida is considered a conservation concern."
