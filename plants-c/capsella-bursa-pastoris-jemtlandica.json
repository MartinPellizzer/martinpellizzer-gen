    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris jemtlandica, commonly known as the Jemtland chickweed, is a variant of the common chickweed, characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white flowers. It is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has a taproot system and produces small, three-lobed fruits that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a slightly succulent texture, while the stems are prostrate and branched. This subspecies is adapted to cooler climates and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
