    "intro": "Campanula aparinoides var. multiflora, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, typically from late spring to early autumn."
