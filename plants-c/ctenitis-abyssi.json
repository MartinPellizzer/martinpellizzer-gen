    "intro": "Ctenitis abyssi, commonly known as the deep-sea bladderworts, is a unique aquatic plant found in deep ocean environments. It belongs to the family Bladderworts, which are known for their specialized structures called bladders used for capturing small prey. This plant thrives in cold, dark waters where sunlight penetration is minimal. Its morphology includes delicate, branching stems and small, translucent leaves that aid in photosynthesis under low-light conditions. Ctenitis abyssi plays a vital role in deep-sea ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microscopic organisms."
