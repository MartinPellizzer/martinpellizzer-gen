    "intro": "Ceropegia pruinosior, commonly known as the sticky ceropegia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, often hairy stems that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green or white, adapted for specific pollinators. Its leaves are usually opposite and may have a waxy coating, contributing to its drought tolerance. Ceropegia pruinosior is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ease of care."
