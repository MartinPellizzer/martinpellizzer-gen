    "intro": "Chrysosplenium lanuginosum, commonly known as the downy chrysosplenium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features small, kidney-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers during the spring, which are often overlooked due to their modest size. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported health benefits."
