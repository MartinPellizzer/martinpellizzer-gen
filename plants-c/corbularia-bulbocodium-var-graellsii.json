    "intro": "Corbularia bulbocodium var. graellsii, commonly known as the Graellsii sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of lakes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower spikes during the summer months. Its botanical characteristics include a rhizomatous root system and a distinctive, linear leaf morphology. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize wetland soils and support local biodiversity."
