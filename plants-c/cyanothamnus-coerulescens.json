It features woody stems with spiny branches, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Cyanothamnus coerulescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native wildlife."
