    "intro": "Caralluma piaranthoides, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Southeast Asia. It features a branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or violet, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration. Caralluma piaranthoides is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
