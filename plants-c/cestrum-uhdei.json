    "intro": "Cestrum uhdei, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and potatoes, and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 feet, with woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a strong, sweet scent that attracts moths and other nocturnal pollinators. Cestrum uhdei is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and dramatic nighttime bloom."
