    "intro": "Calyptrochilum ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaf calyptrochilum, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and has a compact, herbaceous growth habit. Its leaves are oval-shaped and often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The species is of interest to botanists due to its ecological adaptations and potential horticultural value."
