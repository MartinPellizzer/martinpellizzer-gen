It features compound leaves with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are often slightly rounded at the tips. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by elongated, twisted pods that contain flat, elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its botanical characteristics make it both an ornamental plant and a weed in many regions."
