    "intro": "Chorizanthe clevelandii, commonly known as Cleveland's jointweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny bracts that enclose its tiny, greenish-yellow flowers. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native climate."
