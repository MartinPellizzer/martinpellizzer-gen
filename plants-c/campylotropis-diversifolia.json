    "intro": "Campylotropis diversifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved climbing clover, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, oval legumes that contain the seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Campylotropis diversifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
