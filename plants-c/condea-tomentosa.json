    "intro": "Condea tomentosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in the leaf axils. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain numerous tiny seeds. Condea tomentosa is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
