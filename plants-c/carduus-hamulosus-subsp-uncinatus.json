    "intro": "Carduus hamulosus subsp. uncinatus, commonly known as the hooked thistle, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a distinctive hooked shape, which aids in its identification. The subspecies is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides."
