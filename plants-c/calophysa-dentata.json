    "intro": "Calophysa dentata, commonly known as the toothed calophysa, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, sandy soils. Calophysa dentata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
