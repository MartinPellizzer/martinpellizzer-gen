It is characterized by its striking, showy yellow flowers that appear in clusters, often resembling flames, which bloom in the summer months. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually smooth and glossy. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds."
