    "intro": "Calyptrocalyx flabellatus, commonly known as the flabellate calyptrocalyx, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive calyptera, a specialized structure that covers the base of the flower and is often modified into a flabellate (fan-like) shape. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae and exhibits a herbaceous growth habit with showy, often colorful inflorescences. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
