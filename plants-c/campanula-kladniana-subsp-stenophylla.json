    "intro": "Campanula kladniana subsp. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Czech Republic. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
