    "intro": "Castela spinosa, commonly known as the spinous castela, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its branched stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Castela spinosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
