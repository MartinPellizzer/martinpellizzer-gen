    "intro": "Chionanthus jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas and limestone soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring, giving it its common name. These flowers are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are simple, opposite, and have a smooth texture, contributing to its ornamental value."
