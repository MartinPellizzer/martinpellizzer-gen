It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a grayish appearance. Ctenium canescens is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
