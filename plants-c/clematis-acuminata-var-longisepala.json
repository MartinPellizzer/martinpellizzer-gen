It features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, with five sepals that are longer than the petals, giving it its specific epithet. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
