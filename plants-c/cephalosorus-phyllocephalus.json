    "intro": "Cephalosorus phyllocephalus, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rocky or woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in subtropical and temperate climates."
