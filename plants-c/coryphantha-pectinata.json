    "intro": "Coryphantha pectinata, commonly known as the pectinate coryphantha, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces fruits that are often consumed by local wildlife. Coryphantha pectinata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in succulent gardens."
