It is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils in open grasslands and rocky areas. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense mats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens."
