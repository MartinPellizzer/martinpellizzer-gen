    "intro": "Cryptogramma cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-shaped book moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a spiral, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Cryptogramma cordifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens or as a decorative element in terrariums."
