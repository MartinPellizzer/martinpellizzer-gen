    "intro": "Cytisus supinus subsp. capitatus, commonly known as the dwarf broom or cushion broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features slender, wiry stems and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
