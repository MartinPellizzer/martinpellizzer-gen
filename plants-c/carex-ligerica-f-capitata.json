    "intro": "Carex ligerica f. capitata, commonly known as the clustered sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wetlands, and is often found in temperate regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
