It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and distinctive, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species. Its rapid growth rate and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it a significant component of the forest ecosystem."
