    "intro": "Columbia macgregorii, commonly known as the MacGregor's columbia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
