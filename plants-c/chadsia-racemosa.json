    "intro": "Chadsia racemosa, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in water conservation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Chadsia racemosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
