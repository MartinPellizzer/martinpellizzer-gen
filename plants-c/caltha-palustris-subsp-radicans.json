    "intro": "Caltha palustris subsp. radicans, commonly known as the creeping marsh marigold, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetlands and moist meadows in northern regions. It features bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along stream banks."
