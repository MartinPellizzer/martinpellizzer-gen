    "intro": "Callitriche autumnalis f. alterna, commonly known as the alternate water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the Plantaginaceae family. It is characterized by its opposite, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with soft, nutrient-rich substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in many regions."
