It belongs to the Cannabaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by small, round fruits that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to coastal and inland environments."
