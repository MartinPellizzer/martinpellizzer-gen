    "intro": "Cocops, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces coconuts, which contain both water and milk, as well as the hard, fibrous husk. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it in sandy or coastal soils. The coconut palm plays a vital role in both ecological and economic systems in tropical regions."
