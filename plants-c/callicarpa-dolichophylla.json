It is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that appear in the spring, followed by vibrant purple berries in the fall. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically 4\u20138 inches long and have a smooth, glossy surface. It thrives in partial to full sunlight and prefers well-drained, moist soil. The berries are not only ornamental but also attract birds and other wildlife, making it a valuable addition to native gardens."
