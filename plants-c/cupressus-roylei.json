It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude forests. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes worldwide."
