    "intro": "Carumbium sebiferum, commonly known as the wax tree, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its bark contains a high concentration of wax, which has been historically used in candle-making and as a water-resistant coating. Due to its resilience, it is often used in reclamation projects in desert areas."
