    "intro": "Cytisus scoparius var. pallescens, commonly known as the silverleaf broom, is a shrub native to western Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its pale green, narrow leaves and yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a woody stem with a distinctive silver-gray bark, which gives it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and sandy habitats. This variety is closely related to other cytisus species and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
