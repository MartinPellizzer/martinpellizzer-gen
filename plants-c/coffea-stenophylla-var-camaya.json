    "intro": "Coffea stenophylla var. camaya, commonly known as the Camayan coffee, is a rare and lesser-known species of coffee plant native to the highlands of Colombia. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for shaded environments. The plant produces small, red berries that contain two seeds, which are used to make coffee beans. It thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and low yield, it is considered a specialty coffee with unique flavor profiles."
