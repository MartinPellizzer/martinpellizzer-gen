    "intro": "Callista alpestris, commonly known as the alpine callista, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, producing small, yellowish-orange petals that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
