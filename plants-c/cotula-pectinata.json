    "intro": "Cotula pectinata, commonly known as the yellow cotula, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas and has a low, spreading growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and the flowers are often mistaken for those of similar species due to their similar appearance. Cotula pectinata is often used in ornamental gardening for its bright, cheerful blooms."
