    "intro": "Campanula samothracica, commonly known as the Samothrace bellflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the Greek island of Samothrace. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Campanula samothracica is considered a vulnerable species."
