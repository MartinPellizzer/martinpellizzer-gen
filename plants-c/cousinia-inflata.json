    "intro": "Cousinia inflata, commonly known as the inflated bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its bright yellow or orange flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cousinia inflata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
