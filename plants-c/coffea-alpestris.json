    "intro": "Coffea alpestris, commonly known as the alpine coffee. It is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family, native to the high altitudes of Ethiopia and Eritrea. This plant is characterized by its small, oval leaves and produces small, white flowers that give way to red berries containing seeds. It is adapted to cold, mountainous environments and grows at elevations above 2,000 meters. Despite its name, it is not cultivated for commercial coffee production due to its low yield and specific growing conditions."
