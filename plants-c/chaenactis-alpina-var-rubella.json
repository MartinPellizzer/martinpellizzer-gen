    "intro": "Chaenactis alpina var. rubella, commonly known as the Alpine Paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it tolerates cold and harsh environmental conditions. Its bright red to orange flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The variety rubella is distinguished by its more intensely colored inflorescences compared to the typical form of Chaenactis alpina."
