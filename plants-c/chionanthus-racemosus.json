    "intro": "Chionanthus racemosus, commonly known as the whiteflower viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fragrant, white, racemose inflorescences that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a slight pubescence on the underside. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its showy flowers."
