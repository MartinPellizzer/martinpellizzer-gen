    "intro": "Caroxylon yazdianum, commonly known as the Yazdianum date palm, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the arid regions of Iran. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery, fan-like leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme desert conditions. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that yield edible dates, although its fruiting is infrequent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Botanically, it belongs to the Arecaceae family and exhibits unique morphological traits that reflect its evolutionary adaptation to harsh environments."
