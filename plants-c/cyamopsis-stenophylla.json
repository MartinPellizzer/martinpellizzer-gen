    "intro": "Cyamopsis stenophylla, commonly known as goatweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring deep roots and a thick, waxy coating on its leaves to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cyamopsis stenophylla is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
