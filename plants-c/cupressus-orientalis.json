    "intro": "Cupressus orientalis, commonly known as the Turkish cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, columnar shape and dark green, scale-like leaves that are arranged in crossed pairs. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age, adding to its ornamental appeal. Cupressus orientalis is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
