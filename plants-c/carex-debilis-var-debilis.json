It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, often with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes during the summer months. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and prefers full to partial sunlight. Carex debilis var. debilis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
