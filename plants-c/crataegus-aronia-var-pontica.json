It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters, featuring thorny branches and oval, dark green leaves that turn red or orange in the fall. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in the spring, followed by red, juicy berries that are edible but often tart. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its seasonal interest and wildlife value."
