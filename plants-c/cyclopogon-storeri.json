    "intro": "Cyclopogon storeri, commonly known as the Storer's cyclopogon, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in a loose inflorescence. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
