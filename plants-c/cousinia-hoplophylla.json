    "intro": "Cousinia hoplophylla, commonly known as the woolly cushion flower, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and thick, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. Cousinia hoplophylla is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range."
