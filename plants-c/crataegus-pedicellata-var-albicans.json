    "intro": "Crataegus pedicellata var. albicans, commonly known as the white-flowered hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and thorny branches, which provide structural support for its dense foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries in the autumn. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in woodland edges or open sunny areas. The white-flowered hawthorn is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
