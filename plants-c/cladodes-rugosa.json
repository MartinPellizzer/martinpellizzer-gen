    "intro": "Cladodes rugosa, commonly known as the rough cladode, is a unique plant characterized by its modified stems that function as leaves. These cladodes are typically thick, fleshy, and covered in a rough, textured surface, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant is native to regions with harsh climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its structure allows it to perform photosynthesis efficiently while minimizing the risk of desiccation. Cladodes rugosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
