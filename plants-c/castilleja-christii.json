    "intro": "Castilleja christii, commonly known as the Christ's paintbrush, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange to red tubular flowers. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. Native to the western United States, it thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and has narrow, linear leaves. Its striking color and unique morphology make it a notable species in its native ecosystems."
