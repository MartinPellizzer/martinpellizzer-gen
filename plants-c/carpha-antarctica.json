    "intro": "Carpha antarctica, commonly known as Antarctic grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the cold climates of Antarctica and sub-Antarctic regions. It has slender, tufted stems and small, narrow leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, icy conditions. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, helping it anchor in the nutrient-poor, rocky soil of its environment. Carpha antarctica plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local microorganisms in extreme environments."
