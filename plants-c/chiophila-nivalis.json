    "intro": "Chiophila nivalis, commonly known as the snow lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It thrives in cold, alpine environments, often growing at elevations above 4,000 meters where temperatures are consistently low. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adapting to the short growing season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, designed to minimize water loss in harsh conditions. Chiophila nivalis plays a vital role in its ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
