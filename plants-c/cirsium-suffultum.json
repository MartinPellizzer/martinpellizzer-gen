    "intro": "Cirsium suffultum, commonly known as the prairie thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, showy purple or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cirsium suffultum plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native environment."
