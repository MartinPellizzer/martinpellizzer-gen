It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks, river margins, and wet meadows. The plant features a basal rosette of pinnately divided, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and arranged in a dense, clustered inflorescence. Cardamine atlantica is known for its delicate appearance and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
