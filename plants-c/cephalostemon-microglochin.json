    "intro": "Cephalostemon microglochin, commonly known as the small glochidium cephalostemon, is a rare and specialized flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers, and is characterized by its unique floral morphology. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often pale green or white, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as mountain forests, where it forms dense colonies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
