    "intro": "Caesalpinia stipularis, commonly known as the stipular flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its bright red or orange feathery flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling flames. The plant has bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its distinctive stipules, which are leaf-like structures at the base of the leaf stalks, give it its scientific name. Caesalpinia stipularis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
