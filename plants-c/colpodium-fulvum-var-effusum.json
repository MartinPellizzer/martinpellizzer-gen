    "intro": "Colpodium fulvum var. effusum, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of xerophytic vegetation."
