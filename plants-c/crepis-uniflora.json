    "intro": "Crepis uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered mouse-ear, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, basal rosette of leaves and a single, erect flower head that typically blooms in late summer. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its morphology and growth habits make it a common sight in meadows and along pathways."
