    "intro": "Cavendishia crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, yellow, and pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cavendishia crassifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique foliage."
