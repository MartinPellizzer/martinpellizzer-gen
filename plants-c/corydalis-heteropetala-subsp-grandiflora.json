    "intro": "Corydalis heteropetala subsp. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered corydalis, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers have two upper petals that are larger and more showy than the lower ones, a characteristic feature of the Corydalis genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens and woodland settings."
