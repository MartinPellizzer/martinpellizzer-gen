    "intro": "Campanula caudata, commonly known as the trailing bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems that often trail or hang over the edges of rock formations or cliffs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Campanula caudata is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant."
