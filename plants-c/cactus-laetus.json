    "intro": "Cactus laetus, commonly known as the joyous cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warm season, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for desert gardens. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and low-maintenance landscaping."
