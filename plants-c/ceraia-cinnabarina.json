    "intro": "Ceraia cinnabarina, commonly known as the scarlet lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its bright red to orange coloration, which is due to the presence of secondary metabolites called usnic acid. This lichen typically grows on bark, stone, or wood in temperate and subtropical regions. It is a photobiont, meaning it forms a symbiotic relationship with green algae. Ceraia cinnabarina is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
