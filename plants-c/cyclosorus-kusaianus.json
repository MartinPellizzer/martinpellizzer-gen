    "intro": "Cyclosorus kusaianus, commonly known as the Japanese water clover, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is native to East Asia, particularly Japan, and thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, giving it a delicate, lily-like appearance. It is often used in aquascaping due to its ornamental value and ability to improve water quality. Cyclosorus kusaianus reproduces through vegetative propagation, forming dense mats that can provide habitat for aquatic life."
