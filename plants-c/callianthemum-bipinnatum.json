It features a mat-forming habit with small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, giving it a delicate appearance. Callianthemum bipinnatum thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
