    "intro": "Celosia spathulifolia, commonly known as the flame flower or blood feather, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky bracts that resemble plumes or feathers, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. Its foliage is often lance-shaped or spatulate, giving it a distinctive appearance. Celosia spathulifolia is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking visual appeal."
