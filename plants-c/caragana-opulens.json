    "intro": "Caragana opulens, commonly known as the peashrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the steppes and semi-deserts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often divided into numerous small, linear leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, followed by pea-like pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils. Caragana opulens is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion and is used in ecological restoration projects."
