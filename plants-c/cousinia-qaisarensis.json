    "intro": "Cousinia qaisarensis, commonly known as the Qaisari cushion plant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Pakistan. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing mat-like structure. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water. Cousinia qaisarensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying drought-resistant flora."
