    "intro": "Cattleya liliputana, commonly known as the miniature cattleya, is a rare and compact orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant produces a single or few inflorescences with narrow, strap-like petals and a spurred lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Due to its limited natural habitat and endangered status, it is highly valued in horticultural circles."
