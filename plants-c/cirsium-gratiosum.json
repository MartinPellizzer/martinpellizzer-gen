    "intro": "Cirsium gratiosum, commonly known as the showy cardoon, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, woolly leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs. The plant produces vibrant purple or pink composite flower heads that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically upright, with a rosette of basal leaves forming at the base. Cirsium gratiosum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to Mediterranean climates."
