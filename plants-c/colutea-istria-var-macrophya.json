    "intro": "Colutea istria var. macrophya, commonly known as the large-seeded broomrape, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on host plants for water and nutrients. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and its leaves are small and often reduced. It is native to parts of Europe and is typically found in grasslands and disturbed soils. The seeds of this species are adapted for dispersal by animals, contributing to its ecological role in certain habitats."
