    "intro": "Cotoneaster tumeticus, commonly known as the Tibetan cotoneaster, is a shrub native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are pink and appear in clusters. Cotoneaster tumeticus is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual appeal."
