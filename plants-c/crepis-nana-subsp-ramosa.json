    "intro": "Crepis nana subsp. ramosa, commonly known as the dwarf mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features small, spoon-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces tiny, yellowish flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and often forms dense mats on the ground. It thrives in moist, grassy habitats and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a common subject in ecological studies and garden cultivation."
