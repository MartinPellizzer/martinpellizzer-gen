It is characterized by its pale green, often whitish or yellowish skin, which distinguishes it from the typical green cucumber. The plant typically produces elongated, slender fruits that are usually smaller than standard cucumbers. It is cultivated for its mild flavor and crisp texture, making it suitable for fresh consumption. This variety is often used in specialty markets and for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance."
