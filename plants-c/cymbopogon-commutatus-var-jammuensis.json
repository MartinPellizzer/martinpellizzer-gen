    "intro": "Cymbopogon commutatus var. jammuensis, commonly known as the Jammu grass, is a perennial grass native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its slender, erect culms and narrow, linear leaves with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, pale-green florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and potential ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
