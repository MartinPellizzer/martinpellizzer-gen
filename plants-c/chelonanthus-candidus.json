    "intro": "Chelonanthus candidus, commonly known as the white-flowered chelonanthus, is a small shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers. The plant produces small, elliptical fruits that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
