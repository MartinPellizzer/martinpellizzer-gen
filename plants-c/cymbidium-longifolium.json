    "intro": "Cymbidium longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and long, narrow leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a distinctive red or purple lip. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cymbidium longifolium is a popular ornamental plant, appreciated for its elegant appearance and fragrant blooms."
