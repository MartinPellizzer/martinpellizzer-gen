    "intro": "Convolvulus incurvus, commonly known as the curlleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a sprawling annual vine that produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
