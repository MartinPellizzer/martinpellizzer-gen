    "intro": "Carex juncella subsp. wiluica, commonly known as the Wiluic sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in dense stands in wetland environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its specific morphological features and habitat preferences compared to other Carex species."
