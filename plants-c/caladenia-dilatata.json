It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, spider-like appearance with a single, showy flower. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in open forests or heathlands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a spider. Caladenia dilatata is a perennial herb that blooms during the autumn season, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
