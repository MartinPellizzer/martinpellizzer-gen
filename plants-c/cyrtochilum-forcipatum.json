    "intro": "Cyrtochilum forcipatum, commonly known as the clawed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure with a single, fleshy leaf. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in a raceme, which bloom during the wet season. Cyrtochilum forcipatum is known for its unique floral structure, with sepals and petals that resemble claws, giving it its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing in the undergrowth of tropical rainforests."
