    "intro": "Ctenitis decomposita, commonly known as the fragmented shield fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often divided into segments, giving it a unique appearance. The plant has a robust, trunk-like structure that supports its large, feathery foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing soruses, are located on the undersides of the fronds."
