    "intro": "Cynanchum tepuiense, commonly known as the tepui milkvetch, is a climbing plant native to the tepuis of South America. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, and its fruits are follicles containing toxic latex. It thrives in the humid, rocky environments of the tepuis, where it often grows on cliffs and in shaded areas. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
