    "intro": "Cyclosorus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf water clover, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are often submerged in freshwater environments. The plant typically grows in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, shallow waters. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, forming dense mats that provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Cyclosorus pygmaeus plays a role in water filtration and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
