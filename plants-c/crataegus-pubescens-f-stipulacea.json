    "intro": "Crataegus pubescens f. stipulacea, commonly known as the stipulate hawthorn, is a botanical variant of the hawthorn species native to the eastern United States. This form is characterized by its distinctive stipules, which are small, leaf-like structures at the base of the leaves, a feature that sets it apart from other hawthorn varieties. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, featuring thorny branches and clusters of white flowers in the spring. Its leaves are usually oval with serrated edges, and it produces small, red berries in the fall. The stipulate hawthorn is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
