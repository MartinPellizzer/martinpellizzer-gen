    "intro": "Callitriche palustris var. stellata, commonly known as starworts, is a species of aquatic plant characterized by its small, star-shaped leaves. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has slender, branching stems that often lie close to the water's surface. Its leaves are usually opposite, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variety is notable for its delicate appearance and its role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
