    "intro": "Caenotus pusillus, commonly known as the small caenotus, is a diminutive flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under the canopy of rainforests. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and often pale in color. Caenotus pusillus is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
