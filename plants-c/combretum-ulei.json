    "intro": "Combretum ulei, commonly known as the yellow flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves that turn bright yellow before falling in the dry season. The plant produces small, pale yellow to green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in medicine and as a source of timber."
