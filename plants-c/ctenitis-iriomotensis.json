    "intro": "Ctenitis iriomotensis, commonly known as the Iriomote ctenophyll, is a rare fern native to the island of Iriomote in Japan. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a vital role in the local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss, it is considered critically endangered and is protected by conservation efforts."
