    "intro": "Codonoboea bombycina, commonly known as the woolly codonopsis, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Its fruit is a follicle that releases seeds with silky appendages, aiding in wind dispersal. Codonoboea bombycina is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
