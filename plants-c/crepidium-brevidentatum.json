    "intro": "Crepidium brevidentatum, commonly known as the short-toothed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions. The plant features a slender, erect stem with few leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in a raceme. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor. Crepidium brevidentatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral structure."
