It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring slender, often multi-stemmed branches. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart red berries in the summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and it thrives in partial shade to full sun in well-drained soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
