    "intro": "Cladium teretifolium var. typicum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland ecosystems in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to prevent water loss. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater wetlands and is adapted to flooded conditions. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to the structure of wetland habitats."
