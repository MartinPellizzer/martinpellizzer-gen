    "intro": "Carex saturata, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a perennial sedge native to the eastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring, often in shades of white or pale blue. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and shaded woodlands. Carex saturata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
