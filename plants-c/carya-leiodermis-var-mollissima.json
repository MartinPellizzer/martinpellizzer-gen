It belongs to the walnut family (Juglandaceae) and is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and oval-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins and female flowers that develop into edible, sweet-tasting nuts encased in a thick, smooth husk. Its wood is highly valued for its strength and workability, making it a sought-after material for furniture and tool handles."
