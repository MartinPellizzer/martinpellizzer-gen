    "intro": "Cryptina, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and yellow composite flowers that resemble dandelions. They are often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. Cryptina species are generally herbaceous and have a short life cycle, typically completing their growth and reproduction within a single growing season. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine."
