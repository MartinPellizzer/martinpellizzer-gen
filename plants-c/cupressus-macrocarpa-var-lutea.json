    "intro": "Cupressus macrocarpa var. lutea, commonly known as the golden cupressus, is a variant of the Australian lacebark tree. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts with the typical green of the standard variety. The leaves are scale-like and tightly pressed against the branches, giving the tree a dense, compact appearance. It is a slow-growing evergreen with a conical shape, often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens. This variety is native to New Zealand and thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight."
