It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and flowering heads. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
