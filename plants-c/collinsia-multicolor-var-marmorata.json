    "intro": "Collinsia multicolor var. marmorata, commonly known as the marble cushion flower, is a strikingly beautiful plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and vibrant, showy flowers that range from white to pink and red. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a silvery or grayish underside that adds to its ornamental appeal. This variety is known for its mottled or marbled patterns on the petals, which give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
