    "intro": "Carex lepidocarpa f. major, commonly known as the large-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are long, narrow, and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in clusters, and are pollinated by wind."
