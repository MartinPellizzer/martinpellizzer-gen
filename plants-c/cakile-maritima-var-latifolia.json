    "intro": "Cakile maritima var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the western coast of the United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its cruciform flowers and pungent odor. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are broad and lobed, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
