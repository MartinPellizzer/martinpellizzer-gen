    "intro": "Caroxylon passerinum, commonly known as the lesser sand bat. It is a small, shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish in color and are clustered in small groups. Caroxylon passerinum is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can remain dormant during periods of drought."
