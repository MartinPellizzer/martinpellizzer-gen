It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family, which includes many plants with showy flowers and adapted to dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by spiny, spherical fruits that contain seeds. It has a low-growing, mat-like structure with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture. Corispermum thelelegium is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry conditions."
