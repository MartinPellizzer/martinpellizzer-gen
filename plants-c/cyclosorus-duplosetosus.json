    "intro": "Cyclosorus duplosetosus, commonly known as the double-serrated water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound leaves that are often submerged in water. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its fronds are covered with small, serrated teeth, giving it its common name. Cyclosorus duplosetosus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
