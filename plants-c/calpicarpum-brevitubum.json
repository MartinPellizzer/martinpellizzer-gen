    "intro": "Calpicarpum brevitubum, commonly known as the short-stemmed calpicon, is a rare and unique plant species found in specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of pink or purple. The plant has a compact growth habit with short, sturdy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and potential role in local ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
