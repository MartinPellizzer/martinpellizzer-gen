    "intro": "Crupina vulgaris subsp. brachypappa, commonly known as coastal crupina, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect, often branched stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Coastal crupina thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is often found in maritime habitats."
