It typically grows to a height of 3 to 15 feet and features thorned branches, which are a characteristic feature of the genus Crataegus. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with serrated edges and a glossy upper surface. Crataegus galbana is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
