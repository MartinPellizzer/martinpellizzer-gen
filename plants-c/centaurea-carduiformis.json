    "intro": "Centaurea carduiformis, commonly known as the carduet or woolly thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its growth habit is generally compact, with a mat-like form that helps it survive in harsh environments. Centaurea carduiformis is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its resistance to drought."
