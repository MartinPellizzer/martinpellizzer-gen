    "intro": "Crambe orientalis var. dasycarpa, commonly known as the hairy-seeded crambe, is a herbaceous annual plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features striking, deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, branching clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that are thickly covered in short, stiff hairs, contributing to its common name. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals."
