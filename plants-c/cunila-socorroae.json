    "intro": "Cunila socorroae, commonly known as Socorro tansy, is a flowering plant native to the island of Socorro in the Revillagigedo archipelago. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and small yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky coastal areas and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a strong, camphor-like scent when crushed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cunila socorroae is considered a rare and endemic species."
