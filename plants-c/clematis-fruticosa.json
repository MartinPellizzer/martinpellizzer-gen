    "intro": "Clematis fruticosa, commonly known as the creeping clematis, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features woody stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or climb. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, blue, and purple during the summer months. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Clematis fruticosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
