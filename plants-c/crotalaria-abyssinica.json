    "intro": "Crotalaria abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to Ethiopia and parts of East Africa. It is an erect annual herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring palmate leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemose inflorescences, which are followed by distinctive triangular or oblong seed pods. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, also known as the legume or pea family, and is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia. Crotalaria abyssinica is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
