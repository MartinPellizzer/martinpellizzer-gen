    "intro": "Chionogentias diemensis subsp. plantaginea, commonly known as the Tasmanian snowgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Tasmania. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, waxy bloom. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat."
