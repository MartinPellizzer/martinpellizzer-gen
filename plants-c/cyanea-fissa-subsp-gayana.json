    "intro": "Cyanea fissa subsp. gayana, commonly known as the Hawaiian bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and mesic shrublands. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, showy blooms that attract pollinators. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation efforts."
