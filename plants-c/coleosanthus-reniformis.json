    "intro": "Coleosanthus reniformis, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by edible tubers that resemble those of traditional arrowroot. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in moist, shaded environments. The plant is valued for its starchy tubers, which are used in culinary applications similar to those of traditional arrowroot."
