    "intro": "Cereus thalassinus, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom at night, a feature that distinguishes it from many other cactus species. The plant has a short, thick stem with spines and is typically grown as a grafted plant, as the rootstock is often a different species. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming make it a popular choice for collectors and gardeners."
