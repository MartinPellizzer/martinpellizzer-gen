    "intro": "Clidemia intonsa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silverleaf, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the summer months. Clidemia intonsa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
