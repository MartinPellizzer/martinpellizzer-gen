    "intro": "Cephalanthera japonica, commonly known as the Japanese twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive, showy flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant produces a single, helmet-shaped flower spike with two small, hood-like petals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and mountainous regions. Cephalanthera japonica is a mycoheterotrophic plant, relying on fungal associations for most of its nutrients."
