    "intro": "Carpogymnia jessoensis, commonly known as the Jesso lichen, is a member of the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its crustose growth form. It typically grows on bark, stones, or soil in temperate forested areas, particularly in East Asia. The thallus is pale yellow to greenish in color, with a finely granular texture. It lacks distinct medulla and has a well-developed cortex. This lichen is often found in humid, shaded environments and is used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
