    "intro": "Castilleja lebgueana, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate and lance-shaped, and it typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Castilleja lebgueana plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host for certain insects."
