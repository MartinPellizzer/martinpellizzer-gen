    "intro": "Cyperus ducis, commonly known as the African umbrella plant, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and a distinctive, umbrella-shaped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Cyperus ducis is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive appearance and ability to tolerate waterlogged soils."
