    "intro": "Cirsium pratense, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are covered in fine, prickly hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, making it a valuable resource for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
