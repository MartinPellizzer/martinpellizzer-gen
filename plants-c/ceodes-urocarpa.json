    "intro": "Ceodes urocarpa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and aromatic resinous sap. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its bark and wood are highly valued for their durability and distinctive scent, making it an important species in traditional medicine and woodworking. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in many of its natural habitats."
