    "intro": "Cupressus pygmaea, commonly known as the miniature cypress, is a small evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, mound-like growth habit and scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, round cones that contain seeds, and it is well adapted to dry, rocky soils. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions. Cupressus pygmaea is also valued for its resilience to drought and pollution, making it a popular choice for urban landscapes."
