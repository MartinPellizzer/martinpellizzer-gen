    "intro": "Carex speciosa var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale to dark brown flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a popular choice for wetland restoration and native plant gardens."
