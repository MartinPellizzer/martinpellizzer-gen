    "intro": "Cyperus cayennensis, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. Cyperus cayennensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
