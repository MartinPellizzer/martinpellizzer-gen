It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. This species is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
