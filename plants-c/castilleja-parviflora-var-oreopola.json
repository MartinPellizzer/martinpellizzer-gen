    "intro": "Castilleja parviflora var. oreopola, commonly known as the Sierra red paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its roots. The plant features bright red to orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its unique botanical structure and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
