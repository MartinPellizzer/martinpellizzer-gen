It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly India and Sri Lanka, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features slender, grass-like blades with a fibrous structure, and its flowering spikes are often adorned with bracts that have nodular or barbed appendages. Chrysopogon nodulibarbis is typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting various insect and bird populations."
