    "intro": "Cracca nana, commonly known as dwarf cow parsley, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches a height of only a few inches, making it well-suited for moist, shaded environments. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and can spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize damp areas effectively. Cracca nana is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other moist habitats across northern Europe and parts of Asia."
