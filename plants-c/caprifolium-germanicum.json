    "intro": "Caprifolium germanicum, commonly known as the German honeysuckle. It is a perennial shrub native to Europe, characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy on the underside. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, reddish berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Caprifolium germanicum is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, thriving in partial shade to full sun."
