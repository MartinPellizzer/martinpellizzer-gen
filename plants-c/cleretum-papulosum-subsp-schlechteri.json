    "intro": "Cleretum papulosum subsp. schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean climate regions."
