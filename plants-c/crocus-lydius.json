It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to violet, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, rounded bulbs that store nutrients for future growth. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in gardens and protected areas."
