    "intro": "Cypripedium macranthos f. albostriatum, commonly known as the white-streaked lady's slipper, is a unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive white and green coloration, featuring prominent streaks and a pouch-like lip. The plant has thick, fleshy rhizomes and is adapted to grow in shaded, moist forest environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is prized for its ornamental value in horticulture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
