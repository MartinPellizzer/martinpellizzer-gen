This variety is typically found in wetland environments, such as marshes and the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in wet soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing soil."
