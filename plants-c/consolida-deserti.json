    "intro": "Consolida deserti, commonly known as the desert sweet pea, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and other flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant produces delicate, spurred petals that are typically pink or purple, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is drought-tolerant and adapted to hot, dry climates, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in its native habitat."
