    "intro": "Clermontia singuliflora, commonly known as the single-flower clermonthe, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, solitary white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rainforests, and is often found in rocky or wooded areas. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and branched. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Clermontia singuliflora is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
