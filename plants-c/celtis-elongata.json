    "intro": "Celtis elongata, commonly known as the Chinese hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a broad, spreading canopy and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, green berries that turn dark purple as they mature. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, and they turn yellow in autumn. Celtis elongata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in urban landscapes for its adaptability and resilience."
