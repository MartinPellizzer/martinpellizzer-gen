It features fragrant, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn reddish in the fall. Its berries are small, black, and edible, though they are often consumed by birds. Cyrilla macrocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils."
