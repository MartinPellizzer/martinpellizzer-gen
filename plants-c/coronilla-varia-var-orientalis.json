    "intro": "Coronilla varia var. orientalis, commonly known as the Persian clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces slender, erect stems that can reach up to 30 cm in height. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
