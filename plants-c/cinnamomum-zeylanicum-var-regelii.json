It is native to Sri Lanka and is characterized by its aromatic, cinnamon-scented bark that is widely used in cooking and traditional medicine. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized evergreen tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are elliptic, glossy, and have a pleasant aroma, while its flowers are small and clustered. The bark is harvested from the trunk and is the primary source of the spice cinnamon."
