    "intro": "Colubrina vellozoi var. paranensis, commonly known as Brazilian beautyberry, is a shrub native to Brazil and parts of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, bright purple berries that remain on the plant throughout the winter. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The berries are not only visually striking but also serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife."
