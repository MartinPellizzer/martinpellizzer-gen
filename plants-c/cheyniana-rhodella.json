    "intro": "Cheyniana rhodella, commonly known as the pink rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, clustered flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep magenta. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. Cheyniana rhodella is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
