    "intro": "Cirsium charadzeae, commonly known as the Charadze's thistle, is a rare and endemic species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at moderate elevations. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes many other thistle and daisy species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
