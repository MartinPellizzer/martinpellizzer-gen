It is a low-growing herb with finely divided, grass-like leaves that form a dense mat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
