    "intro": "Carduus radicans, commonly known as the creeping thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of spiny, gray-green leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by prickly, spiny fruits. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows. Its aggressive growth habit makes it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
