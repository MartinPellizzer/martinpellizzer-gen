It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to white. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for ornamental use in gardens or as a ground cover. The fruit is a small, round berry that turns red when mature, often containing several seeds."
