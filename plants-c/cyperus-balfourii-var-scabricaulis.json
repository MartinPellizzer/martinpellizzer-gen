    "intro": "Cyperus balfourii var. scabricaulis, commonly known as the rough-stemmed flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist to waterlogged soils. Its stems are rough to the touch, giving it its scientific name, and it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This species is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
