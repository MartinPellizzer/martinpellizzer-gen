    "intro": "Cynodon nlemfuensis var. robustus, commonly known as the Natal grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its coarse, stiff blades and tufted growth habit, which makes it well-suited for grazing and erosion control. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in savannas and grasslands. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to spread aggressively, forming dense mats. It is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to withstand heavy grazing."
