    "intro": "Claytonia palustris, commonly known as marsh pink, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features rosettes of lance-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along stream banks. Claytonia palustris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
