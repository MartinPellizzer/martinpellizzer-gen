    "intro": "Cynanchum mexicoense, commonly known as Mexican milkweed, is a perennial herb native to Mexico. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its milky sap. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are yellow with a distinctive horn-shaped structure, and it produces follicles that contain toxic seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by herbivores, contributing to its survival in the wild."
