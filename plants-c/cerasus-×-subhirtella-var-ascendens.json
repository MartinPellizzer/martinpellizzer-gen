    "intro": "Cerasus \u00d7 subhirtella var. ascendens, commonly known as the Weeping Cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its distinctive weeping habit, with long, cascading branches that create a striking visual effect. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, red, sweet fruits in summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped, glossy, and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. This ornamental plant is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal beauty."
