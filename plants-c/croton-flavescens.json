    "intro": "Croton flavescens, commonly known as the yellow croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that range in color from bright yellow to deep green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by woody, spiny capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
