    "intro": "Cyperus pectinatus, commonly known as the spike rush, is a perennial wetland plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, and it thrives in moist to aquatic environments. Cyperus pectinatus is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
