    "intro": "Clidemia involucrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of white, yellow, or red, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Clidemia involucrata is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means."
