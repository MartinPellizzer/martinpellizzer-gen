It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, orange-red flowers. The plant produces small, yellow fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal regions. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some areas."
