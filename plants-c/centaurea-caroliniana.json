    "intro": "Centaurea caroliniana, commonly known as Carolina cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as fields and roadsides. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with distinctive bracts, which are modified leaves that surround the flower cluster. Its seeds are encased in spiky, bur-like structures that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. The species is also known for its medicinal uses in traditional herbal remedies."
