    "intro": "Croton speciosus, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that range from red to orange, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate or elliptic in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by woody, spiny capsules containing seeds. Croton speciosus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks due to its vibrant foliage and showy display."
