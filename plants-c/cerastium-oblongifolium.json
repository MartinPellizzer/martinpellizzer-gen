    "intro": "Cerastium oblongifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically broad and slightly hairy, arranged in a dense rosette at the base. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers during the spring and early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments like woodlands and rocky slopes. Its fibrous roots make it a hardy plant that can tolerate poor soil conditions."
