    "intro": "Cathartolinum berlandieri, commonly known as the Mexican thornapple, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces toxic, milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which can be harmful to humans and animals. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain seeds, and the plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Despite its toxicity, it plays a role in local ecosystems as a food source for certain insects and birds."
