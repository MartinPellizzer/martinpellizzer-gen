    "intro": "Chimonanthus parviflorus, commonly known as the winter jasmine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, and have four to six petals. The winter jasmine is well adapted to temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and early blooming habit."
