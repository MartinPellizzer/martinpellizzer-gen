    "intro": "Cyrtandra cretacea, commonly known as the Cretaceous Cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with glossy, ovate leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal forests or on rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
