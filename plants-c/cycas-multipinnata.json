    "intro": "Cycas multipinnata, commonly known as the Southern Cross cycad, is a species of cycad native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base of the plant and female cones emerging from the upper part of the trunk. Cycas multipinnata is a slow-growing, long-lived plant that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its striking appearance and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
