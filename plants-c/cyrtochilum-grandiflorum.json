    "intro": "Cyrtochilum grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered cyclostigma, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with a short, stocky rhizome and a cluster of fleshy, strap-like leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange-red with a distinctive, spurred lip. Its flowers are often arranged in a dense inflorescence and bloom during the rainy season. Cyrtochilum grandiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in warm, humid environments."
