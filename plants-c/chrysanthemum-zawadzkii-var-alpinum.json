    "intro": "Chrysanthemum zawadzkii var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine chrysanthemum, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces daisy-like flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun exposure. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its foliage is typically covered in fine, hairy textures, which help protect it from harsh alpine conditions."
