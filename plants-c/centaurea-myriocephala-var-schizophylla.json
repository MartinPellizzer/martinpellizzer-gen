It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant features slender, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed or split, giving it its common name. Its showy, purple to pink flower heads bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping in arid landscapes."
