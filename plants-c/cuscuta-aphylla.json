    "intro": "Cuscuta aphylla, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid life cycle, often completing its growth within a few weeks. The plant's stems are wiry and covered in small, scale-like structures that help it attach to host plants. It is found in various regions, including North America and parts of Europe, and thrives in disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants."
