It features slender, ascending or spreading branches with small, narrow leaves that are usually green and slightly hairy. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. This variety is closely related to other species in the genus Comesperma, sharing similar ecological and morphological traits."
