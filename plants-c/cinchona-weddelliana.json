    "intro": "Cinchona weddelliana, commonly known as the Weddell's quinine tree, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant is notable for its production of alkaloids, including quinine, which has historically been used in medicine. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often found in cloud forests. Due to its medicinal value and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
