    "intro": "Cochemiea maritima, commonly known as the coastal cholla, is a succulent cactus native to the coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that branch into clusters, forming a dense, shrub-like structure. The plant features small, pale green to blue-gray cladodes, which are modified stems that perform photosynthesis. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cochemiea maritima is well adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration."
