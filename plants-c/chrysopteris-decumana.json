It features delicate, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Due to its unique foliage and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
