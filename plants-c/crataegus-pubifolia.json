It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to ovate leaves with a pubescent underside, and small, white to pinkish flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Crataegus pubifolia is often found in moist woodlands, stream banks, and other shaded or semi-shaded habitats."
