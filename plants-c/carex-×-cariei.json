    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 cariei, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Carex acutata and Carex lyngbyei, characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and wetlands, where it thrives in full to partial sunlight. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in a loose, cylindrical shape, typical of many sedges."
