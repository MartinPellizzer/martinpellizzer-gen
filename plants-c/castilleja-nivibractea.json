    "intro": "Castilleja nivibractea, commonly known as the snow bract castilleja, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study."
