It features a slender, erect stem with a single, narrow ovate leaf that is often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces a single spike bearing several small, white or pale green flowers with a distinctive, elongated spur. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil.
