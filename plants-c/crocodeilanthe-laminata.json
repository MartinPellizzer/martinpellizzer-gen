    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe laminata, commonly known as the shield fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often thick and fibrous, which help anchor it to moist, rocky substrates. The leaves are usually evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking feature in its natural habitat."
