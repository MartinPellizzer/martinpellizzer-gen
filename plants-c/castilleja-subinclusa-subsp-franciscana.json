    "intro": "Castilleja subinclusa subsp. franciscana, commonly known as the Franciscan paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its botanical features include slender stems, opposite leaves, and a distinctive floral structure that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
