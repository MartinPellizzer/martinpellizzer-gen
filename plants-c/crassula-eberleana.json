It features compact, rounded stems that are often tinged with red or purple hues, especially when exposed to bright light. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
