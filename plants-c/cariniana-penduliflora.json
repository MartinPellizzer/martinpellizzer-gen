    "intro": "Cariniana penduliflora, commonly known as the pendulous caryota, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that hang in clusters, giving it its common name. Its fruits are woody, three-lobed capsules that contain several seeds. Cariniana penduliflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
