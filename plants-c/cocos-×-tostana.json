    "intro": "Cocos \u00d7 tostana, commonly known as the hybrid coconut palm, is a naturally occurring hybrid between *Cocos nucifera* (the tall coconut palm) and *Cocos humilis* (the dwarf coconut palm). It exhibits a mix of characteristics from both parent species, including a shorter stature and a more compact growth habit. The plant produces coconuts that are typically smaller than those of *Cocos nucifera*, with a higher oil content in the flesh. Its leaves are broader and more robust, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This hybrid is valued for its resilience to environmental stress and its potential for agricultural use in tropical regions."
