    "intro": "Coffea toshii, commonly known as Toshii coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the highlands of Ethiopia and is known for its unique flavor profile. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds used for coffee. It is a shade-tolerant species, often grown in mixed forest environments. Due to its limited cultivation, it is considered a rare and less commercially significant coffee variety."
