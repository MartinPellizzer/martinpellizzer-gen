    "intro": "Calpandria quiscosaura, commonly known as the Andean moonflower, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid environment. Its flowering period coincides with the cooler months, allowing it to thrive in the mountainous climate. Calpandria quiscosaura is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
