    "intro": "Cirsium ciliolatum, commonly known as the silky thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green leaves with soft, fuzzy margins, and its purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in alpine meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Cirsium ciliolatum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
