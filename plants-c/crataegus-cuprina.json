    "intro": "Crataegus cuprina, commonly known as the prickly pear or common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally not consumed by humans. Crataegus cuprina is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
