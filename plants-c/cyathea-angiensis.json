It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant is evergreen and can grow up to several meters in height, with a slow growth rate. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its structural support, while its fronds are used in traditional medicine in some regions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
