    "intro": "Coccanthera devosiana, commonly known as the Devosian cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features a globular or cylindrical stem covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in clusters at the top of the stem during the spring and summer months. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall."
