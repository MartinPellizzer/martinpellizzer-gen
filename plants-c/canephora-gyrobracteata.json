    "intro": "Canephora gyrobracteata, commonly known as the spiral bract coffee plant, is a species native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits containing edible seeds. Its botanical features make it distinct within the Rubiaceae family, particularly due to its unique spiral arrangement of bracts. It is primarily cultivated for its seeds, which are used in the production of coffee."
