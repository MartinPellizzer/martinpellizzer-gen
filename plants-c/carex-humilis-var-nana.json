    "intro": "Carex humilis var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are borne on spikes that rise above the foliage. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its compact size and ability to tolerate water make it a valuable plant for stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
