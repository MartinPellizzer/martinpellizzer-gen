    "intro": "Coelogyne stellaris, commonly known as the star orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The flowers bloom in late winter or early spring, making it a sought-after ornamental plant for collectors."
