    "intro": "Calamagrostis lilloi f. grandiflora, commonly known as the grandiflora reedgrass, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, panicle-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green coloration, and its flowers are often pink to purplish in hue. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy or riparian habitats. This ornamental grass is valued for its visual appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
