    "intro": "Cineraria microphylla, commonly known as the rock cineraria, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with silver-gray foliage and small, daisy-like blue or violet flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact size and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants. Cineraria microphylla is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
