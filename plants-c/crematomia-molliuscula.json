    "intro": "Crematomia molliuscula, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, often blooming in the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and can spread extensively, making it an aggressive weed in agricultural settings. Crematomia molliuscula is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
