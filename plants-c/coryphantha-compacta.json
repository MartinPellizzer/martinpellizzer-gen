    "intro": "Coryphantha compacta, commonly known as the compact cactus or the small-leaf hedgehog cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a low, compact shrub. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Coryphantha compacta thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
