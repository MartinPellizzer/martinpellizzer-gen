It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a vibrant splash of color to the landscape. The leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture, while the bark is smooth and light gray in color. This cultivar is often planted for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil. It is also known for its showy, pod-like fruit that matures in the fall."
