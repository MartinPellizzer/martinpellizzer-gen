    "intro": "Cactus urinarius, commonly known as the urine cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to absorb rainwater efficiently in its dry environment. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss through transpiration. Despite its unusual name, it plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various desert animals."
