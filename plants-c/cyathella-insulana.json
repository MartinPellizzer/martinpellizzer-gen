    "intro": "Cyathella insulana, commonly known as the island cyathella, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily on certain remote islands in the Pacific. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae, which includes tree ferns and related species. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyathella insulana is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
