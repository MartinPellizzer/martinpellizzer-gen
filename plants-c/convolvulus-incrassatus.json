    "intro": "Convolvulus incrassatus, commonly known as the thickleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and trumpet-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is a climbing vine with hairy stems and produces small, round berries that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
