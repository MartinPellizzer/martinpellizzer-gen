    "intro": "Citrus vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis lime, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of the South Pacific. It produces small, round, green fruits that are typically harvested when they are still unripe and contain a high concentration of citric acid. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that are oppositely arranged along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. The fruit is primarily used for culinary purposes, particularly in traditional Polynesian recipes."
