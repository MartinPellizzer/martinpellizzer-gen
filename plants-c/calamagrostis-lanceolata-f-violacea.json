    "intro": "Calamagrostis lanceolata f. violacea, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a striking ornamental grass with slender, upright culms that produce dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its most distinctive feature is the vivid purple coloration of its flower heads, which stand out against the green foliage. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full to partial sun. It is often used in garden landscapes for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. The plant's foliage remains attractive throughout the growing season, making it a versatile choice for water gardens or naturalized areas."
