    "intro": "Cereus candelabrum, commonly known as the candlestick cactus, is a species native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and clusters of white, night-blooming flowers. The plant has a ribbed structure with prominent areoles, from which both spines and flowers emerge. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. The flowers, which open at night, are an important feature for attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths."
