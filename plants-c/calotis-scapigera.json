    "intro": "Calotis scapigera, commonly known as the scapigera dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, producing a fluffy seed head that aids in wind dispersal. Calotis scapigera is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
