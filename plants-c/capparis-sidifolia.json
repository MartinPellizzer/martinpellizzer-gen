    "intro": "Capparis sidifolia, commonly known as the coastal caper, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often followed by edible, tangy berries. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salt spray from the sea. Its botanical features make it well-suited for coastal restoration projects and horticultural use in dry climates."
