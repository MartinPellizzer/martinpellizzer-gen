    "intro": "Cyrtidiorchis frontinoensis, commonly known as the Frontino orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and vibrant coloration. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are small but striking, featuring intricate patterns and a specialized lip that aids in pollination by certain insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
