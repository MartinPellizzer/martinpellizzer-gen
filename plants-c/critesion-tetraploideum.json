    "intro": "Critesion tetraploideum, commonly known as the tetraploid cress, is a species of flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its tetraploid genome, which means it has four sets of chromosomes, making it distinct from its diploid relatives. The plant typically features small, green, lobed leaves and produces yellow flowers with four petals. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of temperate climates. Due to its genetic makeup, it is of interest in botanical studies related to polyploidy and plant evolution."
