    "intro": "Camarotis latisaccata, commonly known as the broad-sac orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, sac-like structures on its flower stems, which are believed to aid in seed dispersal. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually greenish or yellowish with a subtle fragrance, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Camarotis latisaccata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
