    "intro": "Cheilanthes greggii, commonly known as Gregg's rockcap, is a species of fern that belongs to the Polypodiaceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, arid environments. The plant is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizome and its ability to form dense colonies on limestone or sandstone substrates. Its fronds are typically short and broad, with a leathery texture that helps it conserve moisture. Gregg's rockcap is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
