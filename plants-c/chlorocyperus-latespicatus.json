    "intro": "Chlorocyperus latespicatus, commonly known as the broadleaf sedges, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and herbaceous growth habit. It typically features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often green or bluish-green in color, with a dense, tufted growth pattern. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences, which are usually composed of tiny, three-lobed flowers. It is often found in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical structure makes it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, contributing to its ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
