    "intro": "Cleisostoma thomatoglossum, commonly known as the golden rosette orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, and is characterized by its compact rosette growth habit. The plant produces showy, golden-yellow flowers with a distinctive, intricate pattern on the petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
