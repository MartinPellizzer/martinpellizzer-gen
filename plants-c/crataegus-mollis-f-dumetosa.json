    "intro": "Crataegus mollis f. dumetosa, commonly known as the creeping hawthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense, sprawling stems that often form mats or thickets. The plant features small, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of white flowers in spring, followed by red berries in autumn. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
