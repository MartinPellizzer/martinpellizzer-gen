    "intro": "Chrysodiscus, commonly known as the golden disc or golden cup, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange flowers that resemble small cups or discs, hence their common name. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. Chrysodiscus species typically grow as shrubs or herbs, often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plants are valued for their ornamental appeal in horticulture."
