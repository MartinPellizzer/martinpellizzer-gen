    "intro": "Colchicum visianii, commonly known as the Visianii colchic, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It produces striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has a short, stout stem and lance-shaped leaves that are typically basal. Its bulbs are toxic and contain colchicine, a compound used in medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a cold winter dormancy period for proper growth."
