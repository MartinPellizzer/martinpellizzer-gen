    "intro": "Crocus vernus var. parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It produces delicate, nodding flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in woodland areas and meadows. Its flowers are relatively small compared to other crocus varieties, hence its common name. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early spring display."
