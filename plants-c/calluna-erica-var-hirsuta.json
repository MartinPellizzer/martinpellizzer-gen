It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late summer. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence, giving it a distinctive texture. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland environments. This hardy species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging landscapes."
