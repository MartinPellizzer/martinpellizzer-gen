    "intro": "Crucianella rigida, commonly known as the rigid sea bean, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a small, shrub-like species that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by water. Crucianella rigida is notable for its salt tolerance and ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
