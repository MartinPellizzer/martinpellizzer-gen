    "intro": "Canthium tekbe, commonly known as the African spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many plants with latex-producing properties. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with simple, alternate leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
