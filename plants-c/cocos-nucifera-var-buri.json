    "intro": "Cocos nucifera var. buri, commonly known as the Burry coconut, is a variant of the coconut palm characterized by its unique, hairy husk that gives it a distinctive appearance. This variety is native to the Pacific Islands and thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and warm temperatures. The fruit produces a sweet, aromatic coconut water and a white flesh that is used in both culinary and traditional applications. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as for its edible products. The plant's resilience to saltwater makes it well-suited for coastal areas and island environments."
