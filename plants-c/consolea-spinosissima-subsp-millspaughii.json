    "intro": "Consolea spinosissima subsp. millspaughii, commonly known as the spiny consolea, is a striking epiphytic cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that bear sharp spines and are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
