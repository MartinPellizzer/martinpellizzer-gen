    "intro": "Columnea tropicalis, commonly known as the flame flower, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting throat. The plant typically grows as a vine or shrub, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea tropicalis is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract hummingbirds."
