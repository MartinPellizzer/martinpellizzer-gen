    "intro": "Cytisus scoparius f. plenus, commonly known as the full-flowered Scotch broom, is a compact, shrub-like form of the species native to western Europe. It is characterized by its dense clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom profusely in early spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in non-native regions."
