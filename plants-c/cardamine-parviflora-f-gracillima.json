    "intro": "Cardamine parviflora f. gracillima, commonly known as the slender water-crowfoot, is a variant of the water crowfoot genus characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and wet meadows. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. Its foliage is often more slender and less robust compared to the typical form of Cardamine parviflora. This fern-like appearance makes it a distinctive and ornamental plant in its native habitat."
