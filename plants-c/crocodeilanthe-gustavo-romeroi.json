    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe gustavo-romeroi, commonly known as the Gustavo-Romero's bryophyte, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Lejeuneaceae. It is a liverwort, characterized by its small, flat, and often intricate leaf-like structures called thallus. This species is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as on rock surfaces or in humid forests. Its morphology includes a distinct thallus with a central axis and lateral lobes, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
