    "intro": "Cyathea cyclodium, commonly known as the rock hibiscus, is a species of tree belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. It produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural dispersal in its native habitat."
