    "intro": "Chaetanthera pentacaenoides, commonly known as the five-lobed moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers open at night and close during the day, a trait known as nyctinasty. The species is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a slow growth rate that allows it to survive in harsh, desert environments."
