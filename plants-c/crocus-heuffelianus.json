It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous underground stem. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its early blooming habit makes it a valuable addition to gardens seeking winter color."
