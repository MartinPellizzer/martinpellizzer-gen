    "intro": "Cimicifuga heracleifolia var. bifida, commonly known as the twin-lobed bugbane, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features tall, slender stems that bear large, white, umbellate inflorescences, which are particularly showy in late summer. The plant has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are often deeply lobed, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and is valued for its ability to attract pollinators. Its botanical name reflects its historical use in traditional medicine, though it is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens."
