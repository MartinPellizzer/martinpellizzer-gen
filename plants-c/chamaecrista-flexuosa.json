    "intro": "Chamaecrista flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag burr legume, is a perennial shrub native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
