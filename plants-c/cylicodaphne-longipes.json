    "intro": "Cylicodaphne longipes, commonly known as the long-leaf sago palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnately compound leaves that are often feather-like in appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark blue, fleshy fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
