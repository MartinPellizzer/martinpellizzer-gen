    "intro": "Centaurea ornata f. crocea, commonly known as the red-headed coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its striking red to orange bracts that surround the yellow disk flowers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its inflorescence is a composite flower head, typical of the Asteraceae family, consisting of both ray and disk florets. The leaves are narrow and linear, often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance."
