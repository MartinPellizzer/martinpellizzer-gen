    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 vulgaris var. pulpa-duci, commonly known as the blood orange, is a unique citrus variant characterized by its deep red pulp and juice. This variety is botanically classified within the Rutaceae family, sharing genetic traits with other citrus species like oranges and lemons. The fruit develops a distinctive coloration due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments, which are more prominent in cooler climates. It typically has a thick, leathery rind and a segmented interior with a sweet, tangy flavor profile. The plant is usually propagated through grafting to maintain its unique traits and fruit quality."
