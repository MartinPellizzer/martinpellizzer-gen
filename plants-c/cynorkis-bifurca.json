    "intro": "Cynorkis bifurca, commonly known as the forked bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Africa. It possesses small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey, such as small crustaceans and insect larvae. The plant's roots are often submerged, and it thrives in nutrient-poor waters where it supplements its diet with captured prey. Its leaves are typically thin and flexible, allowing them to move and position themselves effectively to ensnare prey. The species is notable for its ability to adapt to varying water conditions while maintaining its specialized feeding mechanism."
