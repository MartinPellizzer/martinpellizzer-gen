    "intro": "Colea membranacea, commonly known as the membranous colea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its scientific name reflects the thin, membranous texture of its leaves, which are a distinctive feature. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, Colea membranacea is considered a vulnerable species."
