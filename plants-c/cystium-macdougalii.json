    "intro": "Cystium macdougalii, commonly known as the Scottish heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Scottish Highlands. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, white wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
