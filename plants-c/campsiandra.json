    "intro": "Campsiandra, commonly known as the sandpaper tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its rough, sandpapery texture on the leaves, which gives it its common name. The plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. Campsiandra species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often with showy, fragrant flowers. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
