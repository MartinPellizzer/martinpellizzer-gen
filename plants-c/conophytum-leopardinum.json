    "intro": "Conophytum leopardinum, commonly known as the leopard tortoise cactus, is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapted to its arid environment. The plant features a distinctive pattern of dark green and light green markings, resembling a leopard's coat. It produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
