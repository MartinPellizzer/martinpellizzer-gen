    "intro": "Cynometra vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis satinwood, is a tropical tree native to the Pacific Islands, including parts of Fiji and Tonga. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing hard, angular seeds. It is valued for its durable wood, which is used in construction and traditional crafts. However, it is relatively rare and faces threats from habitat loss and overharvesting."
