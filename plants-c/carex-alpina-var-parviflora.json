    "intro": "Carex alpina var. parviflora, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. This variety is distinguished by its small, pale green to brownish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and wetland restoration projects."
