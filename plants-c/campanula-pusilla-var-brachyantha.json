    "intro": "Campanula pusilla var. brachyantha, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a compact, low-growing plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and typically reaches a height of only a few inches. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
