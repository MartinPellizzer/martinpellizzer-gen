    "intro": "Chenopodium pallescens, commonly known as white goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that typically grows in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in small, dry fruits called utricles, which are characteristic of the Chenopodium genus. The plant is often found in arid or semi-arid environments due to its ability to tolerate drought conditions."
