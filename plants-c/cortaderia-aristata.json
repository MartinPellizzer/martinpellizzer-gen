    "intro": "Cortaderia aristata, commonly known as the fountain grass, is a striking ornamental grass native to South America. It features tall, slender, arching blades that give it a soft, flowing appearance, often reaching heights of up to 6 feet. The plant produces fluffy, silver-gray seed heads that persist through winter, adding visual interest to the landscape. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense clumps make it both low maintenance and visually appealing."
