    "intro": "Chrysopogon lawsonii, commonly known as Lawson's grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
