    "intro": "Ctenopteris dissimulans, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizome system supports the growth of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. The ghost fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
