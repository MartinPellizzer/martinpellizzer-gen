    "intro": "Carum aphanopleurae, commonly known as the ghost caraway, is a rare and elusive plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and delicate white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its seeds are similar in appearance to those of other caraway species, often leading to confusion in identification. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Carum aphanopleurae is considered a vulnerable species."
