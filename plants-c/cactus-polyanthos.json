    "intro": "Cactus polyanthos, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a compact, multi-branched structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of desert plants. Its most striking characteristic is the profusion of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has spiny stems and is adapted to thrive in low-water environments with high sunlight exposure. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
