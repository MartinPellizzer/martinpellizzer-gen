    "intro": "Chlaenobolus rugosus, commonly known as the rough-spored earthstar, is a unique member of the family Lecanoraceae. It is a lichen that forms a distinctive, star-like structure with a central stalk and a fleshy, lobed upper part. The plant's thallus is typically crustose, with a rough, uneven surface that gives it its common name. It is often found on rocks and soil in moist, temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, called soredia, are dispersed by wind and contribute to its ability to colonize new areas."
