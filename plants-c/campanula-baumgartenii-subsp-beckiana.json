    "intro": "Campanula baumgartenii subsp. beckiana, commonly known as the Beck's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to violet, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
