    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia var. scabriuscula, commonly known as the rough-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features distinctive bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, typically from June to August. The leaves are round and slightly hairy, giving the plant its \"scabriuscula\" designation, which refers to its rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, bell-like blooms."
