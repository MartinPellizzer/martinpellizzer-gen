    "intro": "Cheilanthes covillei, commonly known as the Coville's rockcap, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rock surfaces, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form with dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded groups called sori. Cheilanthes covillei is well adapted to drought conditions and can survive in poor soil conditions due to its ability to store water in its leaves."
