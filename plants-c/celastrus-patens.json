    "intro": "Celastrus patens, commonly known as the climbing staff-vine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous vine that typically grows along forest edges and in woodland areas. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Celastrus patens is often found in moist, well-drained soils and can climb trees or shrubs using its tendrils."
