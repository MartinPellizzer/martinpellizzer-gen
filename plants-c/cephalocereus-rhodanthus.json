    "intro": "Cephalocereus rhodanthus, commonly known as the pink night-blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and dark green, spiny leaves. The plant produces striking pink flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in arid gardens."
