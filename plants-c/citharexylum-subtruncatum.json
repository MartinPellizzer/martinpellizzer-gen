It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular garden plant, though it can become invasive in some regions."
