    "intro": "Coelogyne edii, commonly known as the red-tipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or orange-tipped petals and a slender, erect stem. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Coelogyne edii is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
