    "intro": "Chlorophytum longipes, commonly known as the snake plant or mother-in-law's tongue, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically variegated with white and green stripes. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires minimal watering, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, which helps it store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Chlorophytum longipes is also noted for its air-purifying properties, contributing to improved indoor air quality."
