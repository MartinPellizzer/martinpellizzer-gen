    "intro": "Crotalaria acutiflora, commonly known as the sharp-flowered crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, also known as the legume or pea family, and is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with pinnately compound leaves and yellow or orange flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in a spiny, inflated pod, which aids in seed dispersal. Crotalaria acutiflora is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
