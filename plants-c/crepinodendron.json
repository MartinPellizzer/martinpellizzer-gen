    "intro": "Crepinodendron, commonly known as the golden apple tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Sapotaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its ornamental value and fruit production. The plant features compound leaves with elongated leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fleshy, orange-colored fruits. Crepinodendron species are often cultivated for their aesthetic appeal and are also valued for their medicinal properties. However, they are relatively rare in cultivation and require specific environmental conditions to thrive."
