    "intro": "Corchorus tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its square, ribbed stems and alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its roots are fibrous and have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory properties. Corchorus tetragona thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
