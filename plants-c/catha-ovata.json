It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its shrub-like structure with lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into woody capsules containing elliptical seeds. Its leaves contain alkaloids, particularly cathinone and cathine, which are responsible for its stimulant effects. Catha ovata is often cultivated for both ornamental and traditional medicinal purposes."
