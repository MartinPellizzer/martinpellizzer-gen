    "intro": "Carduus \u00d7 jordanii, commonly known as the Jordanian thistle, is a hybrid perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia, this plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It has a robust root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range."
