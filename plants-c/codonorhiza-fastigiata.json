    "intro": "Codonorhiza fastigiata, commonly known as the upright codonorhiza, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
