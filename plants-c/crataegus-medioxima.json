    "intro": "Crataegus medioxima, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 3\u201310 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and showy white or pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which are edible but often used in jams and wines. Crataegus medioxima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
