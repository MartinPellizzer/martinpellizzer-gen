    "intro": "Carex pensylvanica var. pinicola, commonly known as the piney sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, bogs, and along stream edges. The plant has grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly curled at the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike that bears small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance."
