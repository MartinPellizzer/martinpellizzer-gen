    "intro": "Cheiranthus acaulis, commonly known as the cushion sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It has dense, compact growth with small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white, yellow, or purple. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, featuring a rosette structure that minimizes water loss and protects against extreme temperatures. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention. Cheiranthus acaulis plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in rocky and barren areas."
