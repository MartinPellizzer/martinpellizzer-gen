It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in suitable habitats. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
