    "intro": "Centaurea papposa, commonly known as the downy centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and its flowers are small, yellowish-orange, and borne in clusters. It produces fluffy, white, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread. Centaurea papposa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
