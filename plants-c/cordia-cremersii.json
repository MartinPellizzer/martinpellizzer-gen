    "intro": "Cordia cremersii, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits. Its botanical features make it an attractive ornamental plant, though it is not widely cultivated outside its native range. The species is also valued for its potential ecological roles in its natural habitat."
