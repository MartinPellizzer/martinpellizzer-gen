    "intro": "Columnea praetexta, commonly known as the red-tipped columnea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, clinging to trees in its natural habitat, and produces showy bracts that enhance its ornamental appeal. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Columnea praetexta is popular in horticulture for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
