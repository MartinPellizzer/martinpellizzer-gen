    "intro": "Carex subcaespitosa, commonly known as the tufted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in a panicle. Carex subcaespitosa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
