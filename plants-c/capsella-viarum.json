    "intro": "Capsella viarum, commonly known as the common mouse-ear or mouse-ear chickweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, rounded leaves and clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms from late spring to early autumn, producing small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
