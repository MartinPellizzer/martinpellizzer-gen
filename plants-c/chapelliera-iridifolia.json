    "intro": "Chapelliera iridifolia, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Chapelliera iridifolia is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
