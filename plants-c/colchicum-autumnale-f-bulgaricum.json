    "intro": "Colchicum autumnale f. bulgaricum, commonly known as the Bulgarian autumn crocus, is a variant of the autumn crocus native to the Balkan region. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive purple or violet flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features large, waxy, spatulate leaves that emerge from a corm, and its flowers are typically borne on tall, erect stems. It is known for its striking appearance and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. However, like its parent species, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
