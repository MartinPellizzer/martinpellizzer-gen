    "intro": "Cerastium albanicum, commonly known as the Albanian chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Cerastium albanicum is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
