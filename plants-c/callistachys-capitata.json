    "intro": "Callistachys capitata, commonly known as the clustered flowering rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanic gardens."
