It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the European Alps, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and high-altitude environments. Its morphology reflects a combination of traits from its parent species, Cirsium arvense and Cirsium discolor. The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
