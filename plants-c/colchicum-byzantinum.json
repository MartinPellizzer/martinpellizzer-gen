It produces striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow center, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a short, sturdy stem that bears one to several flowers, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. The bulbs are toxic and contain colchicine, a compound used in medicine."
