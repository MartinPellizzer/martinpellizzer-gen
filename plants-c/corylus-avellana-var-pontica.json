    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. pontica, commonly known as the Pontic hazel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southeastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins in early spring, with male and female flowers on separate plants. Its edible nuts, encased in a spiny husk, are a valuable food source for wildlife and humans. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive form and autumn color."
