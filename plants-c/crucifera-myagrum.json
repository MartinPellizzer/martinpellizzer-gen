    "intro": "Crucifera myagrum, commonly known as the wild radish, is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and distinctive pod-like fruits. This plant typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are pinnately lobed, and the plant produces yellow flowers that attract pollinators like bees. The seeds are enclosed in a long, slender pod, which splits open when mature to release the seeds. Crucifera myagrum is also known for its edible roots and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
