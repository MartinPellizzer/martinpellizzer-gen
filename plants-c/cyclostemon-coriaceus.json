    "intro": "Cyclostemon coriaceus, commonly known as the leatherleaf cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage composed of long, narrow, dark green leaves that are arranged in a compact rosette. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy ornamental plant in suitable climates. Due to its slow growth and longevity, it is often cultivated for its unique appearance and historical significance."
