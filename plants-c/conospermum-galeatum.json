    "intro": "Conospermum galeatum, commonly known as the coastal conospermum, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich structure. Conospermum galeatum is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
