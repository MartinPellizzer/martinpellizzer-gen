    "intro": "Campimia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are shrubs or small trees with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. They produce showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Campimia species are adapted to hot, dry climates and are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance."
