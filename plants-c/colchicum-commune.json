    "intro": "Colchicum commune, commonly known as the meadow colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces red or orange bulbs that store nutrients for the next growing season. Its flowers are usually solitary and have six petals that curl backward, giving them a distinctive appearance. Colchicum commune is also known for containing toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals."
