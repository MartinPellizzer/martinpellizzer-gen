It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy areas and has slender, upright stems with opposite leaves. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.
