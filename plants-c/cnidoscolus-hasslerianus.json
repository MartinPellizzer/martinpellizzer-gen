    "intro": "Cnidoscolus hasslerianus, commonly known as the \"Mexican stinging leaf\" or \"hassler's stinging leaf,\" is a flowering plant native to Central America and northern South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact with the skin. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
