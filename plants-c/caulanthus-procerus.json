    "intro": "Caulanthus procerus, commonly known as the tall silversword, is a flowering plant native to the coastal dunes of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and silvery-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to sandy soils and can withstand salt spray from the ocean. Caulanthus procerus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for native wildlife."
