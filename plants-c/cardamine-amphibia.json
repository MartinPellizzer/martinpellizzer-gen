    "intro": "Cardamine amphibia, commonly known as the water shield, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant found in wetlands and shallow water habitats. It has heart-shaped leaves that are typically floating or submerged, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in a terminal umbel. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in its environment. Cardamine amphibia plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
