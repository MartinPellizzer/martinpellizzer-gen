    "intro": "Calyptrion berteroi, commonly known as the African rock fig, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
