    "intro": "Cytisus monspessulanus var. kunzeanus, commonly known as the Spanish broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, woody stems and compound leaves with small, oval leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in Mediterranean climates. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in non-native habitats."
