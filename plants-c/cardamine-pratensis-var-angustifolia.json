    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil along the edges of ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant features finely divided, spear-shaped leaves that are often submerged, with small white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and serving as a food source for various herbivores."
