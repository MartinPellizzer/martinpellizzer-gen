    "intro": "Cardamine savensis var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy watercress, is a perennial herb native to moist, calcareous habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a single umbel, which are typically borne on slender, branching stems. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, making it a common sight in stream banks and wet meadows. This variety is distinguished by its dense hair covering, which helps reduce water loss and protects against herbivory."
