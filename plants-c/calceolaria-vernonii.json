    "intro": "Calceolaria vernonii, commonly known as the Vernon's slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically bright orange or yellow. The plant has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it adapt to its high-altitude environment. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
