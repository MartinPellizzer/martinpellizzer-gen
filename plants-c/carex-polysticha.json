    "intro": "Carex polysticha, commonly known as the common sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and a dense cluster of spikelets at the top. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Carex polysticha is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
