    "intro": "Calamagrostis villosa var. subgeniculata, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the northeastern United States. It features tall, slender stems with silky, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland restoration and landscape design."
