    "intro": "Crepidium fontinale, commonly known as the water helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of about 15-30 centimeters and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in wet soil, while its flowers are often pollinated by flies and beetles. Crepidium fontinale is a perennial plant that plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland habitats."
