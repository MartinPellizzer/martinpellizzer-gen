    "intro": "Cyclosorus weberi, commonly known as the Weber's water clover, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that are typically submerged in freshwater environments. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still waters, such as ponds and lakes, and is often found in nutrient-rich substrates. Its leaves are usually green and can exhibit a variety of shapes depending on light and water conditions. Cyclosorus weberi plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
