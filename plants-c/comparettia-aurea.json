It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy texture that aids in water retention. The flowers bloom in clusters, adding a vibrant splash of color to its environment."
