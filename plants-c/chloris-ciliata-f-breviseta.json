    "intro": "Chloris ciliata f. breviseta, commonly known as the short-haired feather grass, is a compact, low-growing grass species native to Australia. It features fine, needle-like leaves with a distinctive hairy texture along the leaf margins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. This ornamental grass is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, attractive turf-like mats."
