    "intro": "Caracalla, commonly known as the wild carrot or Queen Anne's lace, is a biennial plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and an umbel of white flowers that resemble a lace doily. The plant produces small, edible seeds that are often used in culinary applications. Caracalla thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas across temperate regions. Its historical use dates back to ancient times, where it was valued for both its medicinal and culinary properties."
