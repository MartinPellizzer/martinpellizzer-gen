    "intro": "Caltha palustris var. polypetala, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features dark green, broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, buttercup-like flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with wet conditions."
