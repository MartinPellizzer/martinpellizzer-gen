    "intro": "Choretrum lateriflorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are narrow and alternate along the stems, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that emerge from the water surface. This plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
