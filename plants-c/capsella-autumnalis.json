    "intro": "Capsella autumnalis, commonly known as autumn cress, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbages and mustard. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the fall, followed by kidney-shaped pods containing seeds. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor, similar to that of watercress. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields and along roadsides."
