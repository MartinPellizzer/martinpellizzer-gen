    "intro": "Campanula bluemelii, commonly known as the Blue Melii bellflower, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features upright stems that bear clusters of striking blue to violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, typically from late spring to early autumn."
