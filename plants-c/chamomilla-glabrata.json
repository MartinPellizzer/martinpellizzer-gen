    "intro": "Chamomilla glabrata, commonly known as blueweed, is an annual flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its blue to purple flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Chamomilla glabrata is often mistaken for other chamomile species but is distinct in its appearance and habitat preferences."
