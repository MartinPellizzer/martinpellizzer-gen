    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia f. hirta, commonly known as the hairy bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its botanical name \"hirta,\" meaning hairy in Latin. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
