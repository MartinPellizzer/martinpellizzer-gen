    "intro": "Cestrum nemanthum, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 feet tall, featuring thick, woody stems and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant is most notable for its large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong, sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. These flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Cestrum nemanthum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
