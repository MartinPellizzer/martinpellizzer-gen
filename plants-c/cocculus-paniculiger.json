    "intro": "Cocculus paniculiger, commonly known as the devil's bit scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its palmately divided leaves and clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream sides. Its fruit is a spherical, spiny capsule that splits open to release the seeds. Cocculus paniculiger is often found in meadows and along the edges of forests, where it plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
