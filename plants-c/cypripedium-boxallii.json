    "intro": "Cypripedium boxallii, commonly known as the Boxall's lady's tresses, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink to white flowers arranged in a loose raceme, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped and grass-like. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in shaded forest understories. It has a long flowering period, typically from May to July, and is known for its unique and intricate floral structure. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
