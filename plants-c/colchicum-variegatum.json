    "intro": "Colchicum variegatum, commonly known as the spotted autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features striking, showy flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn, typically in shades of purple, pink, and white. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous corm, which serves as its storage organ. Its flowers are borne on tall, erect stems and are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Colchicum variegatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique and dramatic floral display."
