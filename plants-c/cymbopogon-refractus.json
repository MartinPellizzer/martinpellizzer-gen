    "intro": "Cymbopogon refractus, commonly known as narrowleaf lemon grass, is a perennial grass native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stalks and aromatic, lemon-scented leaves that contain high concentrations of citral. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy areas. Its essential oils are widely used in perfumery and aromatherapy due to their pleasant fragrance and potential therapeutic properties. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
