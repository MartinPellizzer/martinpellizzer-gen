    "intro": "Cladobium majus, commonly known as the golden tamarisk, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Tamaricaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with woody stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Cladobium majus is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species in regions with limited water availability."
