It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, woolly hair. Corydalis rupifraga is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
