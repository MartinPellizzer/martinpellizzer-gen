It is characterized by its trailing or prostrate growth habit, with numerous stolons that root at the nodes. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that give way to orange-red berries. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly waxy texture. It is often cultivated as a ground cover or ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy blooms."
