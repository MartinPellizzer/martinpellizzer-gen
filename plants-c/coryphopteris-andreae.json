    "intro": "Coryphopteris andreae, commonly known as the Andean holly fern, is a species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, compound fronds that are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and mountainous areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Coryphopteris andreae plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
