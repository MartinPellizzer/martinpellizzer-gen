    "intro": "Carmichaelia suteri, commonly known as the Kauri orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the North Island of New Zealand. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Carmichaelia suteri is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
