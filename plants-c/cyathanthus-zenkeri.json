    "intro": "Cyathanthus zenkeri, commonly known as the Zanzibar lily, is a striking flowering plant native to the tropical regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant features strap-like, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Cyathanthus zenkeri is typically found in coastal areas and is well adapted to sandy soils and high salinity. Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it requires specific care to thrive outside its native environment."
