    "intro": "Cyperus kerstenii, commonly known as the narrowleaf paperplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to reddish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Cyperus kerstenii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common ornamental and wetland plant."
