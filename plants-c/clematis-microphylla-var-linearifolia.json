    "intro": "Clematis microphylla var. linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 15 feet, making it suitable for trellises or arches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually a bright green, providing good contrast to the flowers. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, requiring regular watering during the growing season."
