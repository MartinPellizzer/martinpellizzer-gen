It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant produces small, sweet, edible fruits known as cherries, which are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.
