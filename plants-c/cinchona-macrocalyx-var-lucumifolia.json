    "intro": "Cinchona macrocalyx var. lucumifolia, commonly known as the purple-leafed quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking purple foliage, which contrasts with its green stems and leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds. It is closely related to other cinchona species, some of which are sources of quinine. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its historical association with the production of medicinal compounds."
