    "intro": "Cassine integrifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf cassine, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple, ovate leaves with entire margins. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Its growth habit is typically rounded, with a spreading canopy that provides shade in forested areas."
