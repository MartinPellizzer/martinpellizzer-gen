    "intro": "Catabrosa aquatica var. chionophila, commonly known as the silverleaf waterplantain, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually appearing in late summer, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates. It is often used in water gardens and wetland restoration projects due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
