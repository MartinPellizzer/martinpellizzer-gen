    "intro": "Cinchona howardiana, commonly known as the pink-veined quinine tree, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves with distinctive pink veins and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain seeds, and it is notable for its historical use in the production of quinine, a compound used to treat malaria. Cinchona howardiana is typically found in humid, shaded environments at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Its ornamental value has also made it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in tropical and subtropical regions."
