    "intro": "Carex okesiana, commonly known as the Okesiana sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and swampy habitats in eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many sedges. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Carex okesiana is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in saturated soils."
