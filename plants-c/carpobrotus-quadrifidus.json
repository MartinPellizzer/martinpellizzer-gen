    "intro": "Carpobrotus quadrifidus, commonly known as ice plant, is a succulent perennial native to South Africa. It features fleshy, prostrate stems and thick, lobed leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread rapidly in suitable habitats. It is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
