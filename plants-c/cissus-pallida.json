It is characterized by its pale green, almost translucent leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil. Cissus pallida is often used in ornamental horticulture for its unique appearance and ease of care."
