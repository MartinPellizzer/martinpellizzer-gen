    "intro": "Cryptantha glomerata subsp. quadrinuculata, commonly known as the clustered cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, showy blue to purple flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its quadrinuculate (four-lobed) ovary, a unique feature that sets it apart from other members of the species. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. The plant is also notable for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which contributes to soil fertility in its native environment."
