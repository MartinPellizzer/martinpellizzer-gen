It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers. The plants typically have long, slender stems and produce clusters of small, showy blooms. Cosmantha species are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. These plants require high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making them popular among orchid enthusiasts."
