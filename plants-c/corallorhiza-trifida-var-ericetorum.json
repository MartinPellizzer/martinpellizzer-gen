    "intro": "Corallorhiza trifida var. ericetorum, commonly known as the Ericaceous Coralroot, is a terrestrial orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-red flowers that are typically arranged in a loose spike, and it thrives in acidic, shaded habitats. It is often found in association with ericaceous plants such as heather and blueberries, which contribute to its specific ecological niche. Due to its reliance on fungal symbiosis, it is considered an indicator species for healthy, undisturbed forest ecosystems."
