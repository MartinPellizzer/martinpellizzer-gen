    "intro": "Calotheca dilatata, commonly known as the broad-leafed sea lettuce, is a species of green alga found in coastal marine environments. It thrives in shallow, tide pool areas where it attaches to rocks or other substrates. The plant has a flat, ribbon-like structure with broad, blade-like leaves that are typically green in color. It reproduces through sexual reproduction, producing gametes that fuse to form zygotes. Calotheca dilatata plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
