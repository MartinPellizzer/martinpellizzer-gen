It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes many valuable timber species. The tree is characterized by its smooth, light-gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-yellow, while the fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds.
