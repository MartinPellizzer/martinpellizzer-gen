    "intro": "Carex plena, commonly known as the variegated sedge, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, strap-shaped leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Carex plena thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and garden settings. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
