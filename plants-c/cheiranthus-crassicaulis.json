    "intro": "Cheiranthus crassicaulis, commonly known as the broad-leaved wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces bright yellow or orange flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Cheiranthus crassicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
