    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 boenninghausiana var. subpaniculata, commonly known as the panicled sedges, is a hybrid sedge species native to the wetlands of North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence that consists of multiple spikelets arranged in a panicle-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland habitats."
