    "intro": "Carlina involucrata var. lanigera, commonly known as the woolly cudweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a single, showy head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and the plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
