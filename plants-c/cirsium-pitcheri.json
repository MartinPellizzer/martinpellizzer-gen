    "intro": "Cirsium pitcheri, commonly known as the lake sedge or the plains gentian, is a flowering plant native to the Great Lakes region of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils near the shores of lakes and along wetlands. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spiky seed heads that disperse its seeds by wind. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Cirsium pitcheri is considered a vulnerable species."
