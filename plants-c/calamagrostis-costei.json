    "intro": "Calamagrostis costei, commonly known as the Coste's reed, is a perennial grass native to parts of Asia, including China and the Korean Peninsula. It typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant features tall, slender culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or white along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are clustered in a loose, open arrangement. Calamagrostis costei is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
