    "intro": "Cyperus hartii, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. Its slender, grass-like stems are often clustered, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Cyperus hartii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
