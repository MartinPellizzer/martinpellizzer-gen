    "intro": "Cynorkis windsorensis, commonly known as the Windsores Orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Windsores. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and intricate, spurred-like structures that aid in pollination by specialized insects. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in shaded forest understories. Its flowering season typically occurs during late spring to early summer, producing clusters of delicate blooms. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, Cynorkis windsorensis is considered a conservation concern."
