    "intro": "Cycas balansae, commonly known as the Balansae cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Cycas balansae is a slow-growing, long-lived plant that thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is also valued for its ornamental appearance."
