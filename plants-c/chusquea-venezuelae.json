    "intro": "Chusquea venezuelae, commonly known as the Venezuelan sword fern, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a dense, clumping growth habit with elongated, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The leaves are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to shaded garden spaces."
