    "intro": "Cheilanthes pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal rock fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and dense, dark green foliage that forms a rosette. The plant produces erect, spore-bearing fronds that are typically shorter than the vegetative fronds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Cheilanthes pyramidalis is often found growing on limestone or granite substrates in desert regions."
