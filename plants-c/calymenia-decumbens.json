    "intro": "Calymenia decumbens, commonly known as the decumbent calymenia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that lie flat on the ground and often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are ovate with a hairy surface. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its unique morphology and ecological preferences, it is of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
