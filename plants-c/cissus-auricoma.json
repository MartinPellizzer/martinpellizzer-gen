    "intro": "Cissus auricoma, commonly known as the ear-shaped cutleaf goosefoot, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed or notched. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in tendrils, and its fruits are red, fleshy berries that contain several seeds. Cissus auricoma is often found growing on rocks or in rocky areas, where it uses its tendrils to climb and spread. Its unique foliage and adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study and horticultural interest."
