    "intro": "Camptouratea leblondii, commonly known as the Leblond's camptouratea, is a rare and little-known species of flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of mostly flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and delicate, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
