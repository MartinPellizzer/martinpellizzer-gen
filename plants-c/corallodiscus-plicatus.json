    "intro": "Corallodiscus plicatus, commonly known as the pleated coralline, is a species of red algae belonging to the family Corallinaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive pleated or folded thallus, which gives it its scientific name. This marine algae is typically found in shallow, warm waters, often attached to hard substrates like rocks. The thallus is calcified, providing structural support and contributing to its characteristic appearance. It plays an important role in marine ecosystems by contributing to reef structure and serving as a habitat for various marine organisms."
