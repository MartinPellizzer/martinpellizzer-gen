    "intro": "Combretum argyrochryseum, commonly known as the golden-leafed flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, papery bark that peels in thin, flaky layers, revealing a vibrant yellowish-green color underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by elongated, winged fruits. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes."
