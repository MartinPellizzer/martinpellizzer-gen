    "intro": "Conospermum ericifolium, commonly known as the coast tea tree, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
