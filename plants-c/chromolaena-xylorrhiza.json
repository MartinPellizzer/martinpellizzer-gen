It is characterized by its rough, stinging hairs on its leaves and stems, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated margin and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges. Chromolaena xylorrhiza is also known for its medicinal uses in traditional herbal remedies."
