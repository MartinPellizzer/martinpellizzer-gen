    "intro": "Connarus subfoveolatus, commonly known as the small-lobed connarus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly in tropical regions of Central and Southern Africa. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds when mature, contributing to its propagation in the wild."
