    "intro": "Corynostigma, commonly known as the silverleaf corynostigma, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, leathery foliage that ranges from silver-gray to deep green, providing ornamental value in gardens. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that persist into winter. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a foundation plant. Corynostigma is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a low-maintenance choice for landscapers."
