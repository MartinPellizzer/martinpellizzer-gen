    "intro": "Crepidium trichopodum, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in a spike, with three sepals and three petals, typical of the orchid structure. It is valued in horticulture for its delicate appearance and ability to bloom in cooler climates."
