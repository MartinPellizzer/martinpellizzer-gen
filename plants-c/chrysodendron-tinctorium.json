It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking orange-red bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that are often overlooked due to the showy bracts. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.
