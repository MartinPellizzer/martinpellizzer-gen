    "intro": "Cornopteris decurrenti-alata f. platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a variant of the decurrenti-alata form of Cornopteris. It is characterized by its broad, lanceolate fronds that are typically longer and wider than those of the typical form. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of pinnae that give the plant a lush, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate moisture and dappled sunlight. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
