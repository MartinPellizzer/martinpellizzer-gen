    "intro": "Cassia siliquosa, commonly known as the Indian laburnum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its long, drooping clusters of golden-yellow flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and its slender, woody stems are often used in traditional medicine. Cassia siliquosa produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in Ayurvedic practices."
