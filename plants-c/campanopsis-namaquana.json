    "intro": "Campanopsis namaquana, commonly known as the Namaqua bellflower, is a South African plant belonging to the Campanulaceae family. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, providing a striking contrast to the showy flowers. Campanopsis namaquana is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
