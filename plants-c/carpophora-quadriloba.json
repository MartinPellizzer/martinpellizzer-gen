    "intro": "Carpophora quadriloba, commonly known as the four-lobed orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers with four distinct lobes. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. The orchid's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in botanical studies."
