    "intro": "Cyanea solenocalyx var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved Cyanea, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories on windward slopes. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for native pollinators. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
