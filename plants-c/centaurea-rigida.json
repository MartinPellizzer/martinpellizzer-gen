    "intro": "Centaurea rigida, commonly known as rigid centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Centaurea rigida is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
