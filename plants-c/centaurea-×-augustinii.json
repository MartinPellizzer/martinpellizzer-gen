    "intro": "Centaurea \u00d7 augustinii, commonly known as the hybrid cornflower, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Centaurea cyanus (blue cornflower) and Centaurea jacea (common knapweed). The plant typically features striking blue to purple flowers with a distinctive central disk, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and disturbed areas. Centaurea \u00d7 augustinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
