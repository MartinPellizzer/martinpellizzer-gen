    "intro": "Cynanchum reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined milkweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite leaves with a net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is known for its milky sap, which is a common feature among milkweeds. Cynanchum reticulatum is often found in dry, open habitats such as fields and woodland edges, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
