    "intro": "Catapodium halleri var. ramosum, commonly known as the hairy catapodium, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the grass family (Poaceae). It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in dryland ecosystems."
