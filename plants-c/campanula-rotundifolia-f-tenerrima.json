It features rounded, broad leaves that are often covered in a fine, white down, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh mountain conditions."
