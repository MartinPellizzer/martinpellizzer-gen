    "intro": "Capparis spinosa var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic caper, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, waxy leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by edible, green berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. This variety is closely related to the common caper, but it has distinct morphological features that set it apart."
