    "intro": "Clematis lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly clematis, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It features slender, woody stems covered in soft, white, woolly hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Clematis lanuginosa thrives in partial to full sun and is typically found in woodland edges or along stream banks."
