    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum oreogenes, commonly known as the mountain mist orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to high-altitude regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble mist or clouds, hence its common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its stems are short and often hidden beneath the soil. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Cirrhopetalum oreogenes is considered an endangered species."
