    "intro": "Carex pamirensis subsp. pamirensis, commonly known as the Pamir sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
