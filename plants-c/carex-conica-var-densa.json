    "intro": "Carex conica var. densa, commonly known as dense cone sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like foliage. The plant produces dense, conical inflorescences that are typically green to brown in color, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture conditions."
