    "intro": "Cassia andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's cassia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. Cassia andersonii is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
