    "intro": "Condylago, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, spiky flower heads and salt-tolerant properties, allowing them to thrive in coastal environments. Condylago species typically have narrow, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid or saline conditions. They are often found growing along shorelines, dunes, and other coastal habitats. The flowers are usually blue or purple, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
