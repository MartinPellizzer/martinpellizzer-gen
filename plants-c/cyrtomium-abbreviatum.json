    "intro": "Cyrtomium abbreviatum, commonly known as the dwarf holly fern, is a small evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically short and compact. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread slowly and form dense clumps. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes."
