It is a large, evergreen fern that can grow up to several meters in height, with a thick, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots. The plant features a crown of arching fronds that can reach lengths of over two meters, with a distinctive, segmented structure. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fertile fronds, which are typically found in the upper part of the plant. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and montane cloud forests."
