    "intro": "Cipura paludosa subsp. mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican marsh cipura, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Central America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered inflorescences that produce delicate white or pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of freshwater bodies. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to the waterlogged conditions of its environment. This species plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
