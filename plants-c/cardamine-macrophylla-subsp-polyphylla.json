    "intro": "Cardamine macrophylla subsp. polyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically borne on slender, upright stems. Its leaves are rich in nutrients and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. This subspecies is often found in wetlands, stream margins, and other moist habitats across temperate regions."
