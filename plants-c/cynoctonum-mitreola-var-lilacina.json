It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped leaves that are dark green and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces striking, cone-like structures that are typically a vibrant lilac or purple color, which is a key feature of this variety. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and among plant enthusiasts."
