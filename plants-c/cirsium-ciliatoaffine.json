    "intro": "Cirsium ciliatoaffine, commonly known as the hairy thistle, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in dry, rocky, or sandy soils. It is often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. The plant's fuzzy, hairy stems and leaves help it retain moisture and deter herbivores."
