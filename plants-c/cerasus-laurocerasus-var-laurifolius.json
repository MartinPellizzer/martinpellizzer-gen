    "intro": "Cerasus laurocerasus var. laurifolius, commonly known as the cherry laurel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features dark green, glossy, ovate leaves that remain dense throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by dark red, edible berries. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its dense foliage and year-round structure. However, it is toxic to humans and animals, so care must be taken when handling or consuming its parts."
