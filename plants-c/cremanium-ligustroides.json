    "intro": "Cremanium ligustroides, commonly known as the creeping thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of spiny, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cylindrical inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and extensive, allowing it to thrive in rocky and arid soils. Cremanium ligustroides is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
