    "intro": "Callitriche bolusii, commonly known as Bolus's water star, is a small aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, floating leaves that are oval to lance-shaped. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, and are usually white or pale pink in color. Callitriche bolusii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through oxygen production."
