It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, delicate leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright red, pea-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
