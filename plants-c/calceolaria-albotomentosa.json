    "intro": "Calceolaria albotomentosa, commonly known as the white-tomentose slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has hairy, woolly leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in its often arid or semi-arid habitat. It blooms in the spring and early summer, producing delicate, showy flowers that attract pollinators like bees and moths. Calceolaria albotomentosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and partial shade."
