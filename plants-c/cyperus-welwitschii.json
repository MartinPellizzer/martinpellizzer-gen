    "intro": "Cyperus welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch reed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a tall, grass-like perennial that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its slender, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Cyperus welwitschii is adapted to waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems."
