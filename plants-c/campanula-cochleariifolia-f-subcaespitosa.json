    "intro": "Campanula cochleariifolia f. subcaespitosa, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with closely spaced stems that root at the nodes, creating a dense carpet of foliage. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, velvety texture. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils in partial shade."
