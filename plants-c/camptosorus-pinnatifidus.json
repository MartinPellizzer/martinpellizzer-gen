    "intro": "Camptosorus pinnatifidus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a triangular cross-section, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowering spikes are usually borne on tall, slender stems and produce small, inconspicuous flowers. Camptosorus pinnatifidus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
