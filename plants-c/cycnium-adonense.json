    "intro": "Cycnium adonense, commonly known as the golden cupplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its hollow, ribbed stems and large, compound leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene that splits open to release seeds. Cycnium adonense thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in wetlands and streambanks."
