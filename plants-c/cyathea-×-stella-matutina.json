    "intro": "Cyathea \u00d7 stella-matutina, commonly known as the Stella Matutina tree fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cyathea cooperi and Cyathea mulleri. It is a tall, tree-like fern that can grow up to 10 meters in height, featuring a thick, sturdy trunk and large, feathery fronds. The plant is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with long, slender pinnae that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. Cyathea \u00d7 stella-matutina is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
