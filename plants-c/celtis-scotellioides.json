It belongs to the Elaeocarpaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round berries that are edible for some bird species. Celtis scotellioides is often found in dry to moist forests and is valued for its hardiness and ornamental qualities."
