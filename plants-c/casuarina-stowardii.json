It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which consists of needle-like leaves arranged in spirals around the stems. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Casuarina stowardii thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in dune environments. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
