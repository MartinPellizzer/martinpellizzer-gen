    "intro": "Crataegus engelmannii f. nuda, commonly known as the Engelmann hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its thornless branches, which distinguish it from other hawthorn species. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are typically oval to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. This species is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
