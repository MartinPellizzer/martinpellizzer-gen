    "intro": "Cassia gooddingii, commonly known as Goodding's cassia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in panicles. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like leaflets. Cassia gooddingii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
