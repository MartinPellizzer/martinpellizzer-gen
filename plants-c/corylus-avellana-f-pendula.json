    "intro": "Corylus avellana f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping hazel, is a unique cultivar of the hazel tree characterized by its cascading branches that droop gracefully from the main trunk. This ornamental plant features small, yellowish-green leaves that turn coppery in the fall, adding seasonal interest to the landscape. The female plants produce edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks, which ripen in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. Its distinctive appearance makes it a popular choice for decorative planting in parks and private gardens."
