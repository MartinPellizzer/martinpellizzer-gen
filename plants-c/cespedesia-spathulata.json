    "intro": "Cespedesia spathulata, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental and ecological landscaping. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically arranged in spikelets, and it produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind. Cespedesia spathulata is valued for its low maintenance requirements and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
