It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that open at night and emit a strong, sweet scent. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Cestrum affine is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its nocturnal beauty."
