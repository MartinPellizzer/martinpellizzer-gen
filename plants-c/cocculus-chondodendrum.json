    "intro": "Cocculus chondodendrum, commonly known as the Indian devil's backbone, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its woody stem and compound leaves. The plant produces striking, pale yellow flowers followed by dark blue berries that contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though caution is required due to its potential toxicity. The plant's unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
