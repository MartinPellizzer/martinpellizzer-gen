    "intro": "Cenchrus incertus, commonly known as the uncertain grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray sheen. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in hard, spiky structures called lemma and palea, which aid in seed dispersal. Cenchrus incertus is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a common weed in disturbed environments."
