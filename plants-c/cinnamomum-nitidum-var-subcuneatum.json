    "intro": "Cinnamomum nitidum var. subcuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-angled cinnamon tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, lanceolate leaves that are often fragrant when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elliptical, dark blue-black berries. Its bark and leaves are used in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic oils. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaf base compared to the typical form of Cinnamomum nitidum."
