    "intro": "Cleistes rosea f. augusta, commonly known as the pink cleistocarp, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, showy, pinkish-white flowers that are typically enclosed within a cup-like structure called a cleistocarp, which opens only when the fruit matures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and is often found in areas with rich, organic soil. Its flowers bloom in early summer, and the plant is known for its short flowering period and limited geographic distribution. Due to habitat loss and limited seed dispersal, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
