    "intro": "Coreocarpus arizonicus, commonly known as the Arizona coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in the plant's propagation in its native habitat."
