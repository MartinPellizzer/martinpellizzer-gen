    "intro": "Cardamine scutata var. formosana, commonly known as the Formosan watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with alternate, doubly pinnate leaves that are finely divided. Its small, white flowers are arranged in a raceme and bloom in early spring. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery taste similar to watercress."
