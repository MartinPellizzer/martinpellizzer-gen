    "intro": "Chamissoa esculenta, commonly known as the edible chamissoa, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by oval, edible fruits that are often consumed raw or cooked. Chamissoa esculenta is valued for its nutritional content, including vitamins and minerals, and is used in traditional Andean cuisine. Its adaptability to high-altitude environments makes it a resilient and culturally significant species in its native range."
