    "intro": "Cyperus scopellatus, commonly known as the seaside flatsedge, is a flowering plant species native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a perennial herb that thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in salt marshes and dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in coastal areas. Cyperus scopellatus plays a vital ecological role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for various coastal organisms."
