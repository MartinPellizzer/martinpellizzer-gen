    "intro": "Crocus chrysanthus, commonly known as the Persian crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Caucasus. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or borders. The flowers are also used in traditional medicine and as a source of saffron-like stigmas."
