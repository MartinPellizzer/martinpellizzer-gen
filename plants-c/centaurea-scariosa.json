    "intro": "Centaurea scariosa, commonly known as the scarious centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and hairy, often reddish stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Centaurea scariosa is a perennial species that blooms from late spring to early autumn."
