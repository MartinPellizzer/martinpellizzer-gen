    "intro": "Campanula humilis, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Campanula humilis is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
