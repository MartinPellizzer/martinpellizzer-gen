    "intro": "Caltha palustris f. integerrima, commonly known as the white marsh marigold, is a botanical variant of the marsh marigold, characterized by its fully hairy leaves and white flowers. It is a perennial herb native to wetlands and moist soils in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in early spring. Its hairy foliage distinguishes it from other forms of Caltha palustris. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
