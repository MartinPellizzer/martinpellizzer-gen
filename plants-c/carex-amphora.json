    "intro": "Carex amphora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces three-sided, boat-shaped fruits. Carex amphora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
