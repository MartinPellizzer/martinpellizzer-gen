    "intro": "Crocus vernus subvar. parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It produces striking, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in woodland areas and meadows. It is characterized by its smaller flowers compared to the typical crocus vernus, which distinguishes it as a subspecies. This plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its early spring display."
