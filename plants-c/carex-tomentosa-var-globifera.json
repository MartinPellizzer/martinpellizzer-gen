    "intro": "Carex tomentosa var. globifera, commonly known as the globeflower sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces rounded, globe-like inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves covered in a soft, woolly layer of fine hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
