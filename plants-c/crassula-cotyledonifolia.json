It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive dry periods. Crassula cotyledonifolia is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
