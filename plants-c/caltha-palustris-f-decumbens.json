    "intro": "Caltha palustris f. decumbens, commonly known as the creeping marsh marigold, is a variant of the marsh marigold native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. This form is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that lie close to the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds."
