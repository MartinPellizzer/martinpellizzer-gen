It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, yellow flowers and lobed leaves. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, often in areas with high salt exposure. It has a low-growing habit and produces small, edible seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is adapted to harsh maritime environments and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
