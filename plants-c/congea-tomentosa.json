    "intro": "Congea tomentosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Indian borage, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, with soft, hairy leaves that give it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Congea tomentosa is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
