    "intro": "Cocos orinocensis, commonly known as the Orinoco coconut, is a species of palm native to South America, particularly Venezuela and Colombia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces large, fibrous fruits that contain a single kernel, similar to other coconut species. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found near water bodies. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
