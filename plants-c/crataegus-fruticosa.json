    "intro": "Crataegus fruticosa, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate leaves, and showy white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries known as haws, which are typically eaten by birds and small mammals. Crataegus fruticosa is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its cardiovascular benefits."
