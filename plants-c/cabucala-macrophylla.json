    "intro": "Cabucala macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant features showy white flowers that open at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its roots anchor in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Cabucala macrophylla plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water life."
