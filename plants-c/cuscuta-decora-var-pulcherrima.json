    "intro": "Cuscuta decora var. pulcherrima, commonly known as the pretty dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is native to North America and is often found on various shrubs and trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants if left unchecked."
