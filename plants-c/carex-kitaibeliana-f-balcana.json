    "intro": "Carex kitaibeliana f. balcana, commonly known as the Balkan sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream sides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with male and female flowers usually occurring on separate spikes."
