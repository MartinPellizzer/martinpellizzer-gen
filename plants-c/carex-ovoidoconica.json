    "intro": "Carex ovoidoconica, commonly known as the oval-conical sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It features upright, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it effective for erosion control. Carex ovoidoconica is valued in wetland restoration projects for its ecological benefits and aesthetic appeal."
