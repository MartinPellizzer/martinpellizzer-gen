    "intro": "Commiphora holtziana subsp. microphylla, commonly known as the little-leaved myrrh tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by the release of a fragrant resin. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its unique appearance and medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
