    "intro": "Calamagrostis accedens, commonly known as the silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and silvery-blue foliage that turns coppery in the fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowering spikes appear in late summer, producing small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind. Calamagrostis accedens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize wetland soils."
