    "intro": "Chamaebuxus alpestris, commonly known as the alpine buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features dense clusters of small, dark green leaves that are leathery in texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Chamaebuxus alpestris is often used in ornamental gardening for its hardiness and visual appeal in harsh climates."
