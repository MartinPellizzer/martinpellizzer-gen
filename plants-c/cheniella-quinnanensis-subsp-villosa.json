    "intro": "Cheniella quinnanensis subsp. villosa, commonly known as the hairy cheniella, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often medicinal properties. The subspecies is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in its often arid and rocky habitat. It typically grows at high altitudes, where it faces harsh environmental conditions that shape its unique adaptations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
