    "intro": "Cistus commutatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Its leaves are covered in fine, glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance, which helps protect it from herbivores and excessive moisture loss. Cistus commutatus is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
