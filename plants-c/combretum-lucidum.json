It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and its striking, bright red or orange flowers that appear in clusters. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy, waxy surface that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in savannas and woodland areas. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
