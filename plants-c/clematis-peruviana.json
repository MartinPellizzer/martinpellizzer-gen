It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive purple or red throat. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Clematis peruviana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to climb trellises or other structures."
