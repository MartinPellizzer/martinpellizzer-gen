    "intro": "Catalpa punctata, commonly known as the northern catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces long, bean-like pods that contain seeds surrounded by a fluffy, cotton-like material. Catalpa punctata is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in open woods. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
