    "intro": "Cardamine triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being oval to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in early spring. Its root system consists of slender, fibrous roots that help anchor it in wet soil. Cardamine triphylla is often found in stream banks, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in cool, damp conditions."
