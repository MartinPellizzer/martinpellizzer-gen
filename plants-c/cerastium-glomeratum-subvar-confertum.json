    "intro": "Cerastium glomeratum subvar. confertum, commonly known as clustered mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that are oval to heart-shaped, and it produces small, spherical fruits known as achenes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a common sight in temperate regions where it contributes to the undergrowth vegetation."
