    "intro": "Carya sulcata, commonly known as the burr oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its deeply furrowed bark and broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny capsules that contain one or two nutlets, which are an important food source for wildlife. Carya sulcata is well adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both moist and dry conditions. Its longevity and ecological importance make it a significant species in forest ecosystems."
