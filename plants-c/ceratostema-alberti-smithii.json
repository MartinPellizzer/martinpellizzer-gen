    "intro": "Ceratostema alberti-smithii, commonly known as the Alberti-Smith's ceratostema, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Sarcandraceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and prefers a cool, moist environment. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
