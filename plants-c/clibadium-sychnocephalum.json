    "intro": "Clibadium sychnocephalum, commonly known as the clustered devil's backbone, is a climbing plant native to South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spiny stems that resemble a backbone. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange or red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant, though caution is necessary due to its toxic properties."
