    "intro": "Chamaecyparis nootkatensis var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping cedar, is a variant of the Alaska cedar characterized by its drooping branches that create a cascading effect. It is a coniferous evergreen with scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping. This variety is valued for its unique appearance and hardiness in temperate climates."
