    "intro": "Curmeria wallisii, commonly known as the Indian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by round, woody fruits containing smooth, black seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
