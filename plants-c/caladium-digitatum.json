    "intro": "Caladium digitatum, commonly known as the pink wing caladium, is a tropical perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with intricate, wavy patterns in shades of pink, white, and green. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, as it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are not typically cultivated for their visual appeal. Caladium digitatum is often grown as a houseplant or in shaded garden beds where it can flourish without direct sunlight."
