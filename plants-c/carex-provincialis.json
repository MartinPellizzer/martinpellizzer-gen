    "intro": "Carex provincialis, commonly known as the provincial sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are usually wind-pollinated. Carex provincialis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
