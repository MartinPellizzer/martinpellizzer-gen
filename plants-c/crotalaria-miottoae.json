    "intro": "Crotalaria miottoae, commonly known as the Miotto's horsegram, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are used as a pulse crop in some regions. Crotalaria miottoae is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable in agricultural systems. However, it can be toxic to livestock if consumed in large quantities."
