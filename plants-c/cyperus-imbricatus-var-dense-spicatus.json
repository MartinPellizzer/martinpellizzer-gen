    "intro": "Cyperus imbricatus var. dense-spicatus, commonly known as the dense spicate flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to saturated soils. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, three-lobed flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
