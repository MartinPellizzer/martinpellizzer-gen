    "intro": "Cassia antillana, commonly known as the Caribbean flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright orange to red flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant produces long, flat pods that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cassia antillana thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in tropical and subtropical regions."
