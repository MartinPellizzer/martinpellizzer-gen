    "intro": "Cynanchum junciforme, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which is characterized by its milky sap and often showy flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. Its slender, erect stems are often branched, and it produces small, greenish or yellowish flowers in clusters. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall drought-resistant morphology."
