    "intro": "Cerastium octandrum var. scandens, commonly known as creeping mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant produces small, white flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are heart-shaped, covered in fine hairs, and arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
