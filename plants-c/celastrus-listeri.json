    "intro": "Celastrus listeri, commonly known as the Sierra Madre gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. Celastrus listeri thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
