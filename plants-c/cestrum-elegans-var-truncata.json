    "intro": "Cestrum elegans var. truncata, commonly known as the truncated nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a slightly waxy surface. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, toxic seeds, making it important to handle with care."
