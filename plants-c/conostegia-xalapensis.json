    "intro": "Conostegia xalapensis, commonly known as the Mexican mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, white flowers that are followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
