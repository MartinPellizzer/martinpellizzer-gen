    "intro": "Campanula napuligera var. redux, commonly known as the reduced bellflower, is a rare and diminutive variant of the Campanula genus. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more delicate flowers compared to its standard counterpart. The plant typically features blue or violet bell-shaped blooms that hang downward, typical of the Campanula family. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized botanic gardens."
