    "intro": "Calanthe zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's calanthe, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and produces striking, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant features a pseudobulb system that stores water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are usually broad and leathery, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Calanthe zollingeri thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories where it receives indirect light."
