It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces distinctive, elongated fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It is well adapted to hot, dry environments and can thrive in poor soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
