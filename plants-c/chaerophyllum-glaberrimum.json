    "intro": "Chaerophyllum glaberrimum, commonly known as the smooth cow parsley, is a flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in umbrella-shaped clusters. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a taproot system and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the carrot family, often mistaken for other similar species."
