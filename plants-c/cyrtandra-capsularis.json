    "intro": "Cyrtandra capsularis, commonly known as the Hawaiian capsular vine, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cyrtandra capsularis is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
