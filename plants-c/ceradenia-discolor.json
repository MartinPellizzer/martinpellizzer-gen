    "intro": "Ceradenia discolor, commonly known as the purple-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple foliage and its delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and prefers well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Ceradenia discolor has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, aiding its survival in its native habitat. Its unique coloration and habitat make it a notable species in the orchid family."
