    "intro": "Chondrorhyncha carinata, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, zigzag-shaped stems and narrow, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
