    "intro": "Chesneya velutina, commonly known as the velvet chesney, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a velvety texture, and its striking yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and it has a compact growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
