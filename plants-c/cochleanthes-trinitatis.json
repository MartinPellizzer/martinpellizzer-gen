    "intro": "Cochleanthes trinitatis, commonly known as the Trinidad violet, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, fragrant blooms during the wet season. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
