    "intro": "Cassiope ericoides, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, needle-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical structure includes a woody stem with dense, compact growth, and it is characterized by its ability to form dense mats. Cassiope ericoides is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
