    "intro": "Cuscuta paitana, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has a vine-like structure that wraps around host plants to extract water and nutrients. The plant is native to various regions in South America and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves producing seeds that can remain dormant in the soil for years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause damage to agricultural crops if left unchecked."
