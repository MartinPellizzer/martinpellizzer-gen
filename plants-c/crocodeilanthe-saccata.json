    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe saccata, commonly known as the sac-like fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its unique, sac-like spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, velvety clusters on the underside of its fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a distinctive, intricate venation pattern. Crocodeilanthe saccata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
