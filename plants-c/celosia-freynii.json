    "intro": "Celosia freynii, commonly known as the flame flower or freyn's celosia, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its striking, spiky bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its vibrant colors, which can range from red to orange and yellow. Celosia freynii is often cultivated in gardens and as a potted plant for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
