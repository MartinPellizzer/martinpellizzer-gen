    "intro": "Cheilanthes formosa, commonly known as the golden lip fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is often found growing on cliffs or in crevices. The plant has a distinctive, compact rosette of glossy, dark green fronds with a yellowish margin. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Cheilanthes formosa is known for its drought tolerance and ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils."
