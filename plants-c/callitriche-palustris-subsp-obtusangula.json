    "intro": "Callitriche palustris subsp. obtusangula, commonly known as blunt-angled water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, opposite leaves that are generally rounded or bluntly angled, giving it its subspecies name. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often floating at the water's surface. This species is adapted to fluctuating water levels and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade."
