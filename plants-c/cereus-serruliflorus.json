    "intro": "Cereus serruliflorus, commonly known as the serrated-flowered cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a tall, columnar cactus with smooth, green stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking, white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
