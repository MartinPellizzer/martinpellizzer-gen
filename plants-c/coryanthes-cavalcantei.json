    "intro": "Coryanthes cavalcantei, commonly known as the red coryanthe, is a striking tropical orchid native to Brazil. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically bright red or orange with intricate patterns. The plant produces a unique, columnar structure that supports its fleshy, hooded petals and a long, narrow spur. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
