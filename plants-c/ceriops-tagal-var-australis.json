    "intro": "Ceriops tagal var. australis, commonly known as the mangrove apple or white mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae. It is characterized by its salt-excreting leaves and its ability to thrive in brackish water environments. The plant has a distinctive prop root system that helps it anchor in soft, waterlogged soils. It produces small, white flowers followed by edible, fleshy berries. This variant is native to coastal regions of Australia and is an important component of mangrove ecosystems."
