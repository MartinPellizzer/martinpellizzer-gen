    "intro": "Couepia vismioides, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or Brazilian cherry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Chrysobalanaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its attractive, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Couepia vismioides is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically used in the production of musical instruments and fine furniture."
