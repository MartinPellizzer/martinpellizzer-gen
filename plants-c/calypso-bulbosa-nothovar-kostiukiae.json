    "intro": "Calypso bulbosa nothovar. kostiukiae, commonly known as the Kostiuk's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers that resemble the ghostly appearance of its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
