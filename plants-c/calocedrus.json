    "intro": "Calocedrus, commonly known as incense cypress, is a genus of coniferous evergreen trees belonging to the cypress family (Cupressaceae). It is characterized by its aromatic foliage and distinctive, often pendulous cones. The genus includes several species, such as Calocedrus decurrens and Calocedrus ovata, which are native to regions in Asia and the Americas. These trees typically have scale-like leaves arranged in crossed pairs, and their bark is often reddish-brown and fissured. Calocedrus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used historically in traditional medicine and as sources of aromatic wood."
