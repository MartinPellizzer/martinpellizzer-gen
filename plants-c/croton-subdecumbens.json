    "intro": "Croton subdecumbens, commonly known as the creeping croton, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow to orange, followed by distinctive, spiky fruit capsules. Its root system is fibrous and can spread extensively, making it adaptable to various soil types. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
