It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flower heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has a robust root system and can spread through both seeds and vegetative means. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
