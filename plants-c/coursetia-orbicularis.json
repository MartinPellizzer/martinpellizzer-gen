    "intro": "Coursetia orbicularis, commonly known as the roundleaf coursetia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its orbicular, or round, leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, dry fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Coursetia orbicularis is adapted to withstand drought and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates."
