    "intro": "Castilleja porphyrosceptron, commonly known as the redstem Indian paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, bright red bract-like flowers that resemble paintbrushes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in open, sunny areas such as meadows and grasslands. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
