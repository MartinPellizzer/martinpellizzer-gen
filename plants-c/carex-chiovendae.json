    "intro": "Carex chiovendae, commonly known as the Chiovenda sedge, is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Italian Alps, specifically in the Dolomites. This perennial herb is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Carex chiovendae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
