    "intro": "Cousinia korshinskyi, commonly known as the Korshinsky's cudweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Cousinia korshinskyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
