    "intro": "Crotalaria eremicola subsp. parviflora, commonly known as the desert crownflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
