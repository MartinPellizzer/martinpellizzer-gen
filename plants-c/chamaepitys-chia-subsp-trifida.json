    "intro": "Chamaepitys chia subsp. trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed chia, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Onagraceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
