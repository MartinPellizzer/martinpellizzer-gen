    "intro": "Catasetum randii, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking yellow and orange flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are unique in that they produce a scent similar to that of a female bee, which attracts male bees for pollination. Catasetum randii is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses due to its specific care requirements."
