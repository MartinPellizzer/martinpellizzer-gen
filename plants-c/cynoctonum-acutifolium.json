    "intro": "Cynoctonum acutifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves with narrow, linear foliage. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
