    "intro": "Cerastium vulgatum var. membranaceum, commonly known as the membranous mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, membranous layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for erosion control in suitable habitats."
