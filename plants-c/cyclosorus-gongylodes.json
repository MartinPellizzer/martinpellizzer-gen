    "intro": "Cyclosorus gongylodes, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a perennial aquatic plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Salviniales and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that float on the water surface. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread across the water's surface, forming dense mats. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are borne in clusters and are typically submerged. Cyclosorus gongylodes is often used in traditional Chinese medicine and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant in water gardens."
