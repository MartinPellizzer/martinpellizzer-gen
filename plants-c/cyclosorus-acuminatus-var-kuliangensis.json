It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a distinctive, lace-like appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
