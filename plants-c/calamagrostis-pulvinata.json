    "intro": "Calamagrostis pulvinata, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial grass native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive purple-tinged foliage, which becomes more pronounced in the autumn. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens and natural landscapes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Calamagrostis pulvinata is valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
