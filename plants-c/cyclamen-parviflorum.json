    "intro": "Cyclamen parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered cyclamen, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It features striking, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces delicate, spurred flowers in shades of pink, white, and red. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cyclamen parviflorum is valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to add color to winter gardens."
