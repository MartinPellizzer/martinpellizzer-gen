    "intro": "Cristaria adenophora, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. It has thin, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. Cristaria adenophora is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the digestion of prey for survival."
