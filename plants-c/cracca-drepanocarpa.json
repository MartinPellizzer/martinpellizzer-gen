    "intro": "Cracca drepanocarpa, commonly known as the broad-leaved cracca, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into several lobes, and its small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cracca drepanocarpa is often found in shrublands and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
