    "intro": "Cyclamen graecum subsp. graecum, commonly known as the Greek cyclamen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a waxy texture and produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and red. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant. It has a corm-like tuberous root system that allows it to survive in dormancy during unfavorable conditions. Cyclamen graecum subsp. graecum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
