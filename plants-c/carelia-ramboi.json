    "intro": "Carelia ramboi, commonly known as the ramboi orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant blooms that range in color from pale pink to deep purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain water in its humid, shaded environment. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Carelia ramboi is now considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
