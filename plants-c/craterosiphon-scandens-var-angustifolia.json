    "intro": "Craterosiphon scandens var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rockweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Amaranthaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along rocky or sandy substrates. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy surface that aids in water retention. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is often found in coastal or arid environments. This variant is adapted to tolerate saline and drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in harsh habitats."
