    "intro": "Castilleja latifolia subsp. insularis, commonly known as the insular castilleja, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Channel Islands of California. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and features bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It relies on a network of roots to parasitize nearby host plants, drawing nutrients and water from them. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it a rare and ecologically significant species."
