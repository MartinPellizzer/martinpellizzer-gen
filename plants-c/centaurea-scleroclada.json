    "intro": "Centaurea scleroclada, commonly known as the desert knapweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has adapted to harsh environments with its deep root system and succulent leaves that help conserve water. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss through transpiration. Centaurea scleroclada is an important plant in ecological studies due to its resilience and role in stabilizing sandy soils."
