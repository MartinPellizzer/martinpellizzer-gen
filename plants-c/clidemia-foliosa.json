    "intro": "Clidemia foliosa, commonly known as Hawaiian false mallow, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. Clidemia foliosa is also considered an invasive species in some regions outside Hawaii due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
