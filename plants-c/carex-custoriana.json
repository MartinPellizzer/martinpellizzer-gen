    "intro": "Carex custoriana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
