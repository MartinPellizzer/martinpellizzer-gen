    "intro": "Calcitrapoides malacitana, commonly known as the Malacitana calcitrap, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive calcareous (chalk-like) leaves, which help it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant exhibits a low-growing, rosette-forming habit, with tightly packed, waxy foliage that reduces water loss. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters during the warmer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
