    "intro": "Cereus amazonicus, commonly known as the Amazonian night bloomer, is a cactus native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure adapted to its arid environment. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Despite its beauty, it is a slow-growing species that requires specific conditions to thrive."
