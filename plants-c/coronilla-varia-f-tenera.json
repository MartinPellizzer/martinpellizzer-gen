It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, hairy pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in agricultural settings for soil enrichment. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant in crop rotation systems."
