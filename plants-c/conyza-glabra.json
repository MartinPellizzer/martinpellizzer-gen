    "intro": "Conyza glabra, commonly known as common ironweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. The plant has hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in composite inflorescences, and it produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. Conyza glabra is considered a weed in agricultural settings but also has ecological value as a food source for insects."
