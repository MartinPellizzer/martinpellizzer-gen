It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces dark reddish-brown fruits that contain winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and for making essential oils. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species."
