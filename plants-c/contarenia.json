    "intro": "Contarenia, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. These plants are characterized by their milky sap, which is a defensive mechanism against herbivores. Contarenia species typically have opposite, ovate leaves and produce showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink, white, or yellow. They are native to various regions in Africa, South America, and parts of Asia. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine and others as ornamental plants."
