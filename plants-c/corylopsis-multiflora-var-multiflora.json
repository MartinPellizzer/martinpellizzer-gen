It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red flower clusters that appear in late winter to early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its ecological value includes providing early nectar sources for pollinators."
