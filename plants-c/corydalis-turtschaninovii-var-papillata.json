    "intro": "Corydalis turtschaninovii var. papillata, commonly known as the Papillate Corydalis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping stems and clusters of small, spurred flowers. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with hairy surfaces that give the plant its distinctive texture. The flowers, which bloom in early summer, are usually pink or purple, and the plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
