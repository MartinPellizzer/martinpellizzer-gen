    "intro": "Cavendishia divaricata, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Cavendishia divaricata thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
