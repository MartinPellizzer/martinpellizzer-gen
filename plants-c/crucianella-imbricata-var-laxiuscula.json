    "intro": "Crucianella imbricata var. laxiuscula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea bean, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Africa. It is a small shrub characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments and coastal scrub. Its fruit is a dry, dehiscent pod that releases seeds when mature, aiding in its dispersal along shorelines. This species is adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
