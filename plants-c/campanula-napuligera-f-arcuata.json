    "intro": "Campanula napuligera f. arcuata, commonly known as the curved bellflower, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or violet, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
