    "intro": "Chamaepeuce \u00d7 sprengeri, commonly known as the hybrid boxwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense, compact foliage with small, oval, dark green leaves that remain throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its slow growth and evergreen appearance, it is often used as a foundation plant or hedge."
