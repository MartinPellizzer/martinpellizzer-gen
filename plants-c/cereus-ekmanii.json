    "intro": "Cereus ekmanii, commonly known as the Easter Cactus, is a species native to Brazil. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its thick, segmented stems that store water. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically during the spring and early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cereus ekmanii is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
