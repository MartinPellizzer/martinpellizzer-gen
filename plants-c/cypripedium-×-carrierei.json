It is a hybrid between Cypripedium yunnanense and Cypripedium calceolus, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant features a tall, erect stem with a single, large, pouch-shaped flower that is typically pink or white in color. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, often forming a rosette at the base of the plant. Cypripedium \u00d7 carrierei is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
