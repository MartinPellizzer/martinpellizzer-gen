It features upright stems covered in dense, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive, soft-textured appearance. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered with a similar fuzzy coating. Campanula marsupiiflora is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
