    "intro": "Chlorospatha bogneri, commonly known as the golden ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking yellow-green petals and a unique, ghostly appearance that sets it apart from other orchids. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a delicate root system and relies on specific environmental conditions for survival. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
