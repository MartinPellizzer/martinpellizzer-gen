It is a columnar cactus with a tall, spiny stem that can grow up to several meters in height. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow and bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It produces small, red fruits that are edible and contain seeds."
