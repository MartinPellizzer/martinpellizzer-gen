    "intro": "Cynodon nlemfuensis, commonly known as the Nlemfu grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. Cynodon nlemfuensis is often used in landscaping and erosion control due to its hardiness and ability to form dense turf."
