    "intro": "Calonemorchis lodgeana, commonly known as the Lodge's calonemorchis, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, spurred flowers that are typically a combination of violet and white. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained, rocky soils, often growing on cliffs or among moss-covered stones. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer, and it is adapted to the extreme conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Calonemorchis lodgeana is considered a sensitive species, making it vulnerable to habitat disruption."
