    "intro": "Coleus defoliatus, commonly known as the leafless coleus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, often brightly colored bracts that resemble leaves. Unlike most coleus species, it lacks true leaves, with only reduced, scale-like structures present. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale purple in color. It is often cultivated for its ornamental bracts, which can add vibrant color to gardens and containers."
