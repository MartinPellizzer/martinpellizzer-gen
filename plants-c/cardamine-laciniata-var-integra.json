    "intro": "Cardamine laciniata var. integra, commonly known as the smooth water shield, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist habitats in North America. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, toothed leaves that are typically smooth and not lobed, distinguishing it from other varieties of Cardamine. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are borne on slender, upright stems. Its leaves are often submerged or partially submerged in water, adapting to wetland environments. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic invertebrates and as a indicator plant for wetland health."
