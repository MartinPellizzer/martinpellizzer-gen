    "intro": "Calamus stolonifer, commonly known as the creeping calamus, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is a rhizomatous plant that forms dense colonies through its stolons, which are horizontal underground stems. The plant produces tall, slender stems with long, narrow, lanceolate leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix enclosed by a spathe, typical of many arum family plants. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in various cultural practices."
