    "intro": "Cardamine tridens, commonly known as the three-toothed water crowfoot, is a delicate aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found along the edges of ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant features finely divided, feather-like leaves that float on the water surface or emerge from the water. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring. Cardamine tridens plays a role in supporting aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for invertebrates and young fish."
