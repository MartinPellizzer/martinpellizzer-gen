It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
