    "intro": "Cereus icosagonus, commonly known as the 20-sided cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking white or pink flowers that bloom at night, a feature typical of many desert plants. Its stem is covered in spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stem."
