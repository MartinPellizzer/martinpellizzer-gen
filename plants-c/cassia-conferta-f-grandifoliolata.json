    "intro": "Cassia conferta f. grandifoliolata, commonly known as the large-leaved cassia, is a variant of the cassia genus native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, giving it a striking visual presence. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, papery flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This ornamental plant is often cultivated for its foliage and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
