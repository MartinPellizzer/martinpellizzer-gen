    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 enontekiensis, commonly known as the Enonteki\u00f6 sedge, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, grass-green leaves and cylindrical inflorescences. This plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and swampy areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with three stamens and a single pistil, typical of the sedge family."
