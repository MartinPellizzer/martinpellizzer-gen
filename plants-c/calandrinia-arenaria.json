    "intro": "Calandrinia arenaria, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous annual with small, showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has succulent-like leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Calandrinia arenaria is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, drought-prone conditions."
