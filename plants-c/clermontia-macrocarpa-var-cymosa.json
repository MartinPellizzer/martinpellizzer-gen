    "intro": "Clermontia macrocarpa var. cymosa, commonly known as the Hawaiian mountain ginger, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
