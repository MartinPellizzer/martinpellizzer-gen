    "intro": "Cuscuta megalantha, commonly known as the giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly specialized structure for attaching to host plants, using haustoria to penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant is native to parts of the Americas and can be found on a variety of host species, including shrubs and trees. Its life cycle involves producing seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and natural vegetation."
