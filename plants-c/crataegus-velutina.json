    "intro": "Crataegus velutina, commonly known as the velvet crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of white to pink flowers in early spring. The plant produces small, yellow or orange fruits that are edible but often tart, containing several seeds. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with finely toothed margins, and it is often found in moist, wooded areas. The velvet crabapple is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for wildlife."
