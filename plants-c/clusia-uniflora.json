It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, featuring thick, waxy leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of showy yellow flowers, which are borne on short pedicels and bloom throughout the year. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant is adapted to thrive in coastal and tropical environments. Clusia uniflora is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray, making it a common sight in coastal regions."
