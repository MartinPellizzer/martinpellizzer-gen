    "intro": "Clermontia \u00d7 leptoclada var. urceolata, commonly known as the Hawaiian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a hybrid species within the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture in its native environment. It is considered an endangered species due to habitat loss and invasive species competition."
