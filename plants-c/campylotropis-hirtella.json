It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with small, hairy stipules. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers in clusters during the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its nitrogen-fixing ability makes it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
