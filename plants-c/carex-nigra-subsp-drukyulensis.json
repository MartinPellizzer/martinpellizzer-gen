    "intro": "Carex nigra subsp. drukyulensis, commonly known as the Druk Yul sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Himalayan region. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and stream sides. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
