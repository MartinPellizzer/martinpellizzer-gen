    "intro": "Chamaemelum olympicum, commonly known as the Olympic chamomile, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Pacific Northwest, particularly in Washington State. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers with white ray florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soil. It is known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its calming effects. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native region."
