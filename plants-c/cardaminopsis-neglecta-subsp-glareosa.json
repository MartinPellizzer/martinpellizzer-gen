    "intro": "Cardaminopsis neglecta subsp. glareosa, commonly known as the glabrous water cress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous plant typically found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features trifoliate leaves with three heart-shaped leaflets and small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to anchor in wet soil and absorb nutrients efficiently. The subspecies is distinguished by its glabrous (hairless) foliage, which sets it apart from other members of the species."
