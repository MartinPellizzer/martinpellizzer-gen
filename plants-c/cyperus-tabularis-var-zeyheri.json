    "intro": "Cyperus tabularis var. zeyheri, commonly known as the Zeyher's flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Poaceae family, though it is often classified within the Cyperaceae family due to its sedge-like appearance. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
