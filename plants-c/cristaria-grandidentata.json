It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach lengths of up to six feet. The plant features prominently toothed margins on its fronds, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
