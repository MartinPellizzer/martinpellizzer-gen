    "intro": "Chenopodium fasciculosum, commonly known as clustered goosefoot, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in small, membranous capsules that split open to release the seeds. Chenopodium fasciculosum is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
