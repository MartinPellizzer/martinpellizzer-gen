    "intro": "Collomia linoides, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its deep root system and waxy leaves. Its seed pods are cylindrical and release seeds when mature, aiding in its dispersal. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
