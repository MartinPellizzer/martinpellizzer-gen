It is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its native arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in native gardens."
