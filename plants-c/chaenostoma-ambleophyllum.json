It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that float on the water surface, with leaves that are often arranged in a zigzag pattern. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually submerged, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. The plant is also known for its ability to tolerate a range of water conditions, making it a resilient species in wetland environments."
