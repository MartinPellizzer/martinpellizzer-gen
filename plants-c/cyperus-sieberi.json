    "intro": "Cyperus sieberi, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) but is often classified under the sedge family (Cyperaceae) due to its morphological similarities. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. It has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a triangular cross-section. Cyperus sieberi is known for its ability to thrive in moist to waterlogged soils, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
