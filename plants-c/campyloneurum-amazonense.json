    "intro": "Campyloneurum amazonense, commonly known as the Amazonian fern, is a tropical fern species native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the forest floor, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of its leaves. This fern plays a vital role in the ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
