    "intro": "Cicercula alata, commonly known as the spreading cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves that grow in a whorled pattern. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Native to certain regions of South America, it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
