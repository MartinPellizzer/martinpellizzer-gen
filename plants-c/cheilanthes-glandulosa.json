    "intro": "Cheilanthes glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features lance-shaped, leathery fronds with a distinctive glandular coating on the underside, which helps reduce water loss. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Cheilanthes glandulosa is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy plant in xerophytic environments."
