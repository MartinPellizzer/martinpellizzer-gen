    "intro": "Cuscuta rogowitschiana, commonly known as the dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that\u7f20\u7ed5 (wrap around) its host. The plant is native to regions of Asia, including China and Russia, and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and establishing a connection with the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants."
