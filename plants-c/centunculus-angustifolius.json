    "intro": "Centunculus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandwort, is a small, low-growing plant native to sandy and rocky soils in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in a compact cluster at the base of the stems. It is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as coastal dunes and gravelly slopes. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
