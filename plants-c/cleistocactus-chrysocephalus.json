    "intro": "Cleistocactus chrysocephalus, commonly known as the golden-headed cactus, is a species of cactus native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in dense, white spines and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening only briefly before closing, a trait known as cleistogamy. This unique botanical feature makes it a fascinating subject for both horticultural and scientific study."
