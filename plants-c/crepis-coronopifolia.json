    "intro": "Crepis coronopifolia, commonly known as the crowned hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow ray flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
