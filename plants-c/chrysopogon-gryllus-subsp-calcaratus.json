    "intro": "Chrysopogon gryllus subsp. calcaratus, commonly known as the sand reed, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a fibrous texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland dry habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is used for erosion control and as a forage plant in some regions."
