It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are typically green and covered with white, spiny tubercles. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, often with a sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its striking appearance and unique blooming habit, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
