    "intro": "Cyperus ekmanii, commonly known as the dwarf papyrus, is a grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along water bodies. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are often clustered in dense spikes, and it produces small, three-angled fruits. Cyperus ekmanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, aquatic conditions."
