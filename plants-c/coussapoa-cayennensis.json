    "intro": "Coussapoa cayennensis, commonly known as the Cayenne coussapoa, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
