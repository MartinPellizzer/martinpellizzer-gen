    "intro": "Cassia apoucouita, commonly known as flame tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bright orange to red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces long, flat pods that contain seeds, and its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. Cassia apoucouita is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant floral display and adaptability to various soil types. It prefers full sun and is drought-tolerant once established."
