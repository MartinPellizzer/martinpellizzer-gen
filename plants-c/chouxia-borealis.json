    "intro": "Chouxia borealis, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with erect, hairless stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing white or pale blue flowers that are attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette, adapting to the harsh, cold environments it inhabits. Chouxia borealis is well-suited to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient member of Arctic flora."
