    "intro": "Clerodendrum ulugurense, commonly known as the Uluguru clerodendrum, is a flowering plant native to the Uluguru Mountains in Tanzania. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to purple. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
