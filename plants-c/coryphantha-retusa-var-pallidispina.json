    "intro": "Coryphantha retusa var. pallidispina, commonly known as the pale-spined hedgehog cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically pale green to blue-gray in color, covered with spines that are shorter and more sparse compared to other Coryphantha species. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its compact size and attractive appearance make it a desirable plant for both ornamental and ecological purposes in arid landscapes."
