It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its seeds are encased in a hard, dry fruit, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
