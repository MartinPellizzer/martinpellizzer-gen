    "intro": "Cornus florida var. rubra, commonly known as the red-flowered dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, bract-like red flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, white berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. The red-flowered dogwood is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
