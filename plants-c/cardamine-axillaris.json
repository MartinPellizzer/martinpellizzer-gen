    "intro": "Cardamine axillaris, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a small herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions in Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface, and its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in a terminal umbel. It produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cardamine axillaris is often found in alpine and subalpine zones, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
