    "intro": "Calamagrostis cabrerae, commonly known as the Canary Islands grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or gray. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral display. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Calamagrostis cabrerae is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
