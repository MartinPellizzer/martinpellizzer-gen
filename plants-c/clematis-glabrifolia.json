    "intro": "Clematis glabrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, twining stems that can grow up to 15 feet in length, supporting its showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically borne in clusters. Its leaves are heart-shaped and smooth, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Clematis glabrifolia thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental vines."
