    "intro": "Celosia exstipulata, commonly known as the flame flower or crested grass, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its striking, feather-like bracts that come in a variety of vibrant colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by the colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Celosia exstipulata is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. It is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures for its purported health benefits."
