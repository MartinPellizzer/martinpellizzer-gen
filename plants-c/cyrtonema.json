    "intro": "Cyrtonema, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Cyrtonema hirsutum, which is native to East Asia. The plants are characterized by their hairy stems and leaves, and they often have showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. Cyrtonema species are typically shrubs or small trees, and they can grow in a variety of habitats, including rocky soils and forest edges. The fruits are usually small berries that contain toxic alkaloids, making them potentially harmful to humans and animals."
