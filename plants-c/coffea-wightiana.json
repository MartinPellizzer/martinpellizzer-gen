    "intro": "Coffea wightiana, commonly known as Wight's coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. Its fruit, which resembles a small orange, contains two seeds used for coffee production. However, it is less commonly cultivated for commercial coffee due to its lower yield and specific growing requirements."
