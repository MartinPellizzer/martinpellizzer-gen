    "intro": "Cypripedium acaule f. lancifolia, commonly known as the lanceleaf lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers with a pouch-like lip that is typically bright pink or red. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread slowly over time. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hence the subspecies name, and are often arranged in a basal rosette. This orchid thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in shaded, forested environments."
