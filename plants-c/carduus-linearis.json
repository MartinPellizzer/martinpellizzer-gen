    "intro": "Carduus linearis, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and silver-gray, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to pink flower heads that consist of numerous small florets, which are arranged in a composite flower structure. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Carduus linearis is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its anti-inflammatory and astringent effects."
