    "intro": "Cynoglossum decurrens var. limense, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are typically blue or violet, with five petals, and are borne in clusters at the leaf axils. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland margins and meadows."
