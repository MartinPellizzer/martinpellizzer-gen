    "intro": "Calyptranthes pachyadenia, commonly known as the thickened-node calyptranthes, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its woody stems with thickened nodes and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on the stems rather than branches. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds."
