    "intro": "Cercidiphyllum japonicum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and China. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that change color throughout the seasons, ranging from bright green in spring to vibrant red, orange, and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It typically grows to a height of 8\u201315 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. The Japanese maple is valued for its ornamental beauty and is widely cultivated in gardens and parks around the world."
