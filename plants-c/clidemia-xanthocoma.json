It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that are often clustered together, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It is typically found growing as an epiphyte on trees in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
