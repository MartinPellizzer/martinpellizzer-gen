    "intro": "Crataegus palmstruchii, commonly known as the Hungarian hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20136 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are edible but often used in jams and wines. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges, hedgerows, and rocky areas. Crataegus palmstruchii is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
