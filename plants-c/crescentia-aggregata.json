    "intro": "Crescentia aggregata, commonly known as the West Indian chestnut, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The tree produces edible, chestnut-like fruits that are encased in a spiny husk. Its bark is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates."
