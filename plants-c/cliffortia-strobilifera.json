    "intro": "Cliffortia strobilifera, commonly known as the Cape snowball, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky, coastal areas and is well adapted to the harsh maritime climate. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fluffy flowers that resemble snowballs, blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cliffortia strobilifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
