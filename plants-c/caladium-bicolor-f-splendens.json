    "intro": "Caladium bicolor f. splendens, commonly known as the flameleaf caladium, is a tropical ornamental plant characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves. The foliage displays striking patterns of red, pink, and white, often with a deep green border. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This cultivar is typically propagated through tuberous roots, which can be planted in spring after the last frost. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for garden beds, containers, and as a houseplant."
