    "intro": "Calamus calolepis, commonly known as the broad-leaved calamus, is a member of the Arecaceae family, commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a tall, slender grass-like plant with long, narrow leaves that are often broad at the base. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, typical of many araceous species. Its rhizomes are fibrous and have been used in traditional medicine and crafts. Calamus calolepis thrives in wet, marshy environments and is often found near water bodies in its native range."
