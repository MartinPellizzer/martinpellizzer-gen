    "intro": "Cyclanthera glauca var. angustiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bitter gourd, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It produces elongated, pale green fruits with a distinctive bitter taste, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and hairy stems, characteristic of the Cucurbitaceae family. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female blooms, typical of many cucurbit species."
