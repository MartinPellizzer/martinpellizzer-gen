    "intro": "Calliphyllon, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking, spiny leaves and showy, dandelion-like flowers that are often blue or purple in color. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and saline environments, adapting to harsh conditions with their salt-tolerant properties. The flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Calliphyllon species are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in coastal ecosystems."
