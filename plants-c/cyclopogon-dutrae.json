    "intro": "Cyclopogon dutrae, commonly known as the Dutra's cyclopogon, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that collect water, a common adaptation in bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with showy, violet-colored flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Cyclopogon dutrae is a relatively rare species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
