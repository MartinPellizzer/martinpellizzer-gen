    "intro": "Coppensia batemaniana, commonly known as the Bateman's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with translucent, waxy petals. The plant is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near the base of trees. Its flowers are small and pale, often appearing in clusters, and it is known for its elusive and difficult-to-locate nature. Due to habitat loss and its restricted distribution, Coppensia batemaniana is considered critically endangered."
