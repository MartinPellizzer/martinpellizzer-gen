    "intro": "Chamaecrista rufa var. exsul, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, papery, pink to reddish-purple leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
