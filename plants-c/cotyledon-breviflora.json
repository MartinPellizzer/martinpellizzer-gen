    "intro": "Cotyledon breviflora, commonly known as the dwarf cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It is a low-growing species, typically reaching only a few inches in height. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is popular among succulent enthusiasts."
