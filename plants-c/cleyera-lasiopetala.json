    "intro": "Cleyera lasiopetala, commonly known as the rough-leaved cleyera, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Japan. It features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Cleyera lasiopetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and seasonal interest."
