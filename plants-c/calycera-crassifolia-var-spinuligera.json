    "intro": "Calycera crassifolia var. spinuligera, commonly known as the spiny leaf calycera, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in small spines, providing a defense against herbivores. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained soils. This species is often found in rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
