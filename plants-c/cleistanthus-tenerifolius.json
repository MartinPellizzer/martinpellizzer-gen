    "intro": "Cleistanthus tenerifolius, commonly known as the Canary Island mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its ornamental value and durable wood, it is sometimes cultivated in warm climates."
