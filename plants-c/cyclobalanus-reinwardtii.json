    "intro": "Cyclobalanus reinwardtii, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests along tidal mudflats and estuaries. The plant has a distinctive appearance with dark, almost black bark and small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its salty habitat. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in clusters, and it produces woody, spherical fruits that contain a single seed. This species plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
