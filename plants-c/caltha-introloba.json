    "intro": "Caltha introloba, commonly known as the spoonwort or marsh marigold, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and moist habitats in North America. It features showy yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its root system is rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and colonize wet areas effectively. Caltha introloba plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
