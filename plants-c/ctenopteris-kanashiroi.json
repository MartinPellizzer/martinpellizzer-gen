    "intro": "Ctenopteris kanashiroi, commonly known as the Japanese cliff fern, is a species of fern native to Japan and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, feather-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. Ctenopteris kanashiroi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, airy foliage."
