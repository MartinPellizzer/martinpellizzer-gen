    "intro": "Calamagrostis chordorrhiza, commonly known as the river reed, is a tall grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, along riverbanks, and in other moist environments, forming dense stands that help stabilize soil. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an effective colonizer of disturbed wetland areas. Calamagrostis chordorrhiza plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for wildlife and improving water quality."
