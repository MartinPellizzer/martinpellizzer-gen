    "intro": "Cotula pyretharia, commonly known as the African daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has hairy, linear leaves and produces tiny seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Cotula pyretharia is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal. It also contains natural pyrethrin compounds, which have been used in botanical insecticides."
