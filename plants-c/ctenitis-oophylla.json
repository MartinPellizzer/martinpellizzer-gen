    "intro": "Ctenitis oophylla, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically divided into small, shield-shaped segments. The plant is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Ctenitis oophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
