    "intro": "Convolvulus chondrilloides var. chondrilloides, commonly known as the sandhill morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a herbaceous annual with slender, twining stems that produce small, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale purple. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and its flowers open in the morning, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and sandy soils. The species is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments."
