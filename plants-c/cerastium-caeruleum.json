    "intro": "Cerastium caeruleum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are clustered at the base of the stems, giving it a dense, mat-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Cerastium caeruleum is often found in disturbed soils and can spread readily through its runners, forming dense colonies."
