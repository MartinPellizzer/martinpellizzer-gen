    "intro": "Cyrtogonium costatum, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often divided into fine, thread-like segments. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant in the sediment while its fronds float on the water's surface. Cyrtogonium costatum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
