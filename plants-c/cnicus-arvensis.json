    "intro": "Cnicus arvensis, commonly known as goatweed, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and prickly, branched stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Cnicus arvensis is known for its ability to spread rapidly through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals."
