    "intro": "Cerasus umbellata, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or sakura, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant produces small, tart berries that ripen in late summer. Its flowers are highly fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The tree is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes and is a symbol of renewal and beauty in Japanese culture."
