    "intro": "Chirita caliginosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land managers."
