    "intro": "Cardamine deserticola, commonly known as the desert watercress, is a small perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky soils and crevices, where it thrives in limited moisture conditions. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often considered a rare and sensitive indicator of specific ecological conditions."
