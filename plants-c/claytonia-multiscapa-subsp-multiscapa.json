    "intro": "Claytonia multiscapa subsp. multiscapa, commonly known as the Sierra sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically features rosettes of fleshy, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, which are arranged in a cluster at the center of the rosette. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and slopes. Its succulent foliage and delicate flowers make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native range."
