    "intro": "Cornus alba subsp. stolonifera, commonly known as the red osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its bright red stems that become more vivid in winter, providing ornamental value throughout the year. The plant produces small white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that attract birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense thickets, making it a hardy and adaptable species."
