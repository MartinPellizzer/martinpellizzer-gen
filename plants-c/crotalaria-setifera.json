    "intro": "Crotalaria setifera, commonly known as the hairy crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers clustered in racemes, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in hard, spiny pods that split open when mature. Crotalaria setifera is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
