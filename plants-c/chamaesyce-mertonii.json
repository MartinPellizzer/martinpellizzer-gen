It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy leaves. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value to its habitat. Chamaesyce mertonii is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
