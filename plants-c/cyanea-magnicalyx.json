    "intro": "Cyanea magnicalyx, commonly known as the Hawaiian bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as rainforests and streamside habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Cyanea magnicalyx is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
