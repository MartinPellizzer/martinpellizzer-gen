It thrives in coastal areas and saline soils, showcasing its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations. The plant features a rosette of spiny, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish, arranged in a head with bracts that provide additional protection. This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting specialized insect pollinators."
