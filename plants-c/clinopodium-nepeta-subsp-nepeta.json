    "intro": "Clinopodium nepeta subsp. nepeta, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant contains high concentrations of nepetalactone, a volatile oil responsible for its stimulating effects on cats and its aromatic properties. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in meadows and along woodland edges. Its historical use in herbal medicine and as a traditional remedy for various ailments highlights its botanical and cultural significance."
