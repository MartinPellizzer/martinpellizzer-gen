    "intro": "Copisma viscidulum var. campestre, commonly known as the sticky copisma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance. Its flowers are inconspicuous, with greenish-white petals and yellow stamens, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. The sticky coating on its leaves is thought to deter herbivores and may aid in water retention."
