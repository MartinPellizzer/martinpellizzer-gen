    "intro": "Caralluma europaea var. decipiens, commonly known as the false prickly pear, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its spiny, paddle-shaped stems that store water. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
