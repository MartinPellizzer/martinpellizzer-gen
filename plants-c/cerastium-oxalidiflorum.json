    "intro": "Cerastium oxalidiflorum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its scientific name reflects its resemblance to both the genus Cerastium and the flower structure of Oxalis species."
