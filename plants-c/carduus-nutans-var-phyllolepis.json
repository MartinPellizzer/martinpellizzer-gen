    "intro": "Carduus nutans var. phyllolepis, commonly known as the leafy carduus, is a variant of the common thistle. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces purple to pink flower heads that consist of many small florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are broader and less lobed compared to the typical variety, giving it a more leafy appearance. This variant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats including meadows and roadsides."
