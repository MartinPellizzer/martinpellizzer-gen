    "intro": "Cyclosorus simplex, commonly known as the small water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, finely divided leaves that form a rosette near the water's surface. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Cyclosorus simplex plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
