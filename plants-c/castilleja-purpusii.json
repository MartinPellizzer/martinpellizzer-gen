    "intro": "Castilleja purpusii, commonly known as the Purpus's paintbrush, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking red to orange tubular flowers. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. Native to the western United States, it thrives in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and has narrow, linear leaves. Its unique floral structure attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance in its native range."
