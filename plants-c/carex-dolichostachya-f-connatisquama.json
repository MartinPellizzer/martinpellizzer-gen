It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in dense, grass-like clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. This subspecies is noted for its compact growth habit and is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
