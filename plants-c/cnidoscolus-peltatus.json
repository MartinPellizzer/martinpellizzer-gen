    "intro": "Cnidoscolus peltatus, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by edible, spiny fruits. Its leaves are also used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory properties. Cnidoscolus peltatus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or near rivers."
