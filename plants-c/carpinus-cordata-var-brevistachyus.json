It features slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are a characteristic feature of the Betulaceae family. Its fruit is a small, winged nut enclosed in a cupule, which splits open to release the seed. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions."
