    "intro": "Couepia leitaofilhoi, commonly known as the Brazilian whiteleaf tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest biome in Brazil, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss, Couepia leitaofilhoi is considered endangered and is of significant interest for botanical research and conservation efforts."
