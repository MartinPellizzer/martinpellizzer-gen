    "intro": "Cassipourea mildbraedii, commonly known as the Malayan ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark timber that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural habitat."
