    "intro": "Cupressus lawsoniana, commonly known as the Lawson cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, columnar shape and scale-like foliage that forms dense, dark green clusters. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds surrounded by a papery wing. Its bark is reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age, while its roots are shallow and fibrous. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
