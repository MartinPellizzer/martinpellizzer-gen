It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
