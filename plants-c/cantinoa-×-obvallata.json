    "intro": "Cantinoa \u00d7 obvallata, commonly known as the hybrid sweet potato, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between *Ipomoea batatas* (sweet potato) and *Ipomoea obvallata* (a wild morning glory). It exhibits a combination of traits from both parent species, including vigorous growth and the ability to produce edible tubers. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trailing vines, which can reach lengths of several meters. Its tubers vary in color, ranging from white to yellow and even purple, depending on the variety. Due to its genetic diversity, Cantinoa \u00d7 obvallata is of interest in agricultural research for improving sweet potato cultivars."
