    "intro": "Carex mollissima var. reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, temperate regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of inconspicuous flowers, typically green or brown, which are followed by triangular, spike-like fruits. It thrives in wet or damp soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other waterlogged habitats. Due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife, it is valued in ecological restoration projects."
