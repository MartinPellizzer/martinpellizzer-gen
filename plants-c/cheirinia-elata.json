    "intro": "Cheirinia elata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
