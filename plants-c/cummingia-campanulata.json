    "intro": "Cummingia campanulata, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert scrublands. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Cummingia campanulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging desert climates."
