    "intro": "Cyclosorus affinis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often submerged or floating. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and marshes, where it can form dense mats on the water surface. Its leaves are usually narrow and elongated, with a slightly serrated edge, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures. Cyclosorus affinis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
