    "intro": "Callitriche microcarpa, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are oval-shaped with a waxy surface. Its small white flowers appear in clusters and bloom from late spring to early fall. Callitriche microcarpa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
