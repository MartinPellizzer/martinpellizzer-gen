    "intro": "Cynopsole elongata, commonly known as the elongated cynopsole, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cynopsoleaceae and is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a stem that elongates as the plant matures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
