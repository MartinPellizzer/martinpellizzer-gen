It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its branched, often thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by hard, woody fruits that contain a single seed. Its latex, which is toxic, has been used traditionally in various applications, including as a natural rubber substitute. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitats."
