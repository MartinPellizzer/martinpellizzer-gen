    "intro": "Chaetochloa italica, commonly known as Italian hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and dense growth habit, often forming lush, carpet-like mats. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is frequently found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
