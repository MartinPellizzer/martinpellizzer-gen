It features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its branching stems and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Its fibrous roots and hairy foliage contribute to its adaptability in arid environments. It is also noted for its historical use in dyeing fabrics due to the presence of certain pigments in its leaves."
