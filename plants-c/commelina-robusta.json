    "intro": "Commelina robusta, commonly known as the blue spiderwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Commelinaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows from 30 to 100 centimeters tall, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Commelina robusta thrives in moist, well-drained environments and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks."
