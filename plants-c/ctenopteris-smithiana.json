    "intro": "Ctenopteris smithiana, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping underground stem that produces new shoots. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night. This unique feature makes it a striking and unusual addition to botanical collections."
