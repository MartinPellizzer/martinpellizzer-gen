It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated flower spike that bears a single, strikingly hooded orchid bloom. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or swampy areas. Its flowers are often pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive, narrow labellum. The species is notable for its unique morphology and is often found in association with specific fungal symbionts."
