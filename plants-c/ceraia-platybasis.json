    "intro": "Ceraia platybasis, commonly known as the broad-winged cerambyrid. It is a species of beetle belonging to the family Cerambyridae, commonly referred to as longhorn beetles. The plant associated with this beetle is the broad-leafed tree or shrub, which serves as both a host for its larvae and a source of nectar for adult beetles. The beetle's life cycle is closely tied to the growth and development of its host plant, making it an important indicator of plant health and ecological balance. Its presence in an ecosystem can provide valuable insights into the biodiversity and sustainability of the surrounding flora."
