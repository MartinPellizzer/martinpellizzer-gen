    "intro": "Charachera viburnoides, commonly known as the velvetleaf viburnum, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
