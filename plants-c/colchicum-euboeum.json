    "intro": "Colchicum euboeum, commonly known as the Aegean colchic, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Greek island of Euboea. It produces striking violet-blue flowers with purple markings, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has a distinctive corm-like structure that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in its native habitat. Its foliage consists of broad, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring. Colchicum euboeum is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or meadow environments."
