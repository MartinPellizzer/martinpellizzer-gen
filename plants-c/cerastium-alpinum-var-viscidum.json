    "intro": "Cerastium alpinum var. viscidum, commonly known as the sticky rock chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky environments. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are covered in a fine, sticky hair that gives it its common name. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with stems that often lie close to the ground. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy species often found in mountainous regions of Europe and Asia."
