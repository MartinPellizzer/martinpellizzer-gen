    "intro": "Crotalaria prostrata var. levis, commonly known as the prostrate crotalaria, is a low-growing annual herb native to tropical regions. It features prostrate or decumbent stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some traditional medicinal practices."
