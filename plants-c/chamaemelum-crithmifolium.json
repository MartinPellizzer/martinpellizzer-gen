    "intro": "Chamaemelum crithmifolium, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in coastal environments with high salinity. Its leaves are narrow and often have a silvery or bluish hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The flowers, which appear in late summer, are blue or purple and are surrounded by bracts that give the plant its distinctive appearance."
