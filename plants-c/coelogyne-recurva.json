    "intro": "Coelogyne recurva, commonly known as the twisted orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant, and often colorful flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has strap-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in a fan shape. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Coelogyne recurva is a pseudobulbous orchid, meaning it has thickened stems that store water and nutrients."
