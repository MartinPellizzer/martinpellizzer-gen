    "intro": "Chaetanthera microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved chaetanthera, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it has a taproot system that allows it to thrive in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native range."
