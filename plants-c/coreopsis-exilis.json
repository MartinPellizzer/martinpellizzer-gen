    "intro": "Coreopsis exilis, commonly known as slender coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils along streambanks and wetlands, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its slender stems and narrow leaves contribute to its delicate appearance, while its blooms attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Coreopsis exilis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and ornamental value."
