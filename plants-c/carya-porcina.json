    "intro": "Carya porcina, commonly known as the hogsqueak or pig oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the walnut family (Juglandaceae) and is characterized by its alternate, simple, and serrated leaves. The tree produces small, green, catkin-like male flowers and female flowers that develop into edible, sweet, chestnut-like nuts. Its bark is thick, scaly, and dark brown, with a distinctive, rugged appearance. Carya porcina is often found in moist, well-drained soils in mixed hardwood forests."
