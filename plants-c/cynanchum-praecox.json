    "intro": "Cynanchum praecox, commonly known as early milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic, is a notable botanical feature. Cynanchum praecox is often found in open, disturbed areas such as fields and roadsides."
