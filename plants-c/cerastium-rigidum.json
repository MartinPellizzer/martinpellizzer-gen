    "intro": "Cerastium rigidum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a sprawling growth habit, often forming mats on the ground. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Cerastium rigidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
