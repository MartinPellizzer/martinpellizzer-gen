    "intro": "Clermontia samuelii, commonly known as Samuel's hibiscus, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Hawaii. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are sturdy and somewhat woody. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Clermontia samuelii is considered endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts in Hawaii."
