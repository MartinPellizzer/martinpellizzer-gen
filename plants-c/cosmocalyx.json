    "intro": "Cosmocalyx, commonly known as the lantern plant, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family. It is native to the Canary Islands and is characterized by its unique, lantern-like flower heads that are often brightly colored. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. Cosmocalyx thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value lies in its vivid, glowing appearance, which adds a dramatic touch to any garden setting."
