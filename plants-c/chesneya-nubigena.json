    "intro": "Chesneya nubigena, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble clouds, hence its common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in shaded forest understories. Its unique morphology includes a short, creeping rhizome and small, clustered sporangia. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chesneya nubigena is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
