    "intro": "Crepis pontica, commonly known as the Pontic hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and cylindrical, ribbed stems. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can be found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Crepis pontica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
