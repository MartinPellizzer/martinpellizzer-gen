    "intro": "Cieca coriacea, commonly known as the rough cactus, is a species of cactus characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and spiny stems. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. The plant's leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Its flowers, typically yellow or orange, bloom during the dry season, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant is well adapted to survive in extreme conditions with minimal water availability."
