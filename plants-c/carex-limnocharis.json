    "intro": "Carex limnocharis, commonly known as water sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. The plant has grass-like leaves that are usually narrow and cylindrical, with a fibrous root system adapted to aquatic conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense spikes, which are often submerged or just at the water's surface. Carex limnocharis plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
