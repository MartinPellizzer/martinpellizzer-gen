    "intro": "Cardamine ovata var. bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It features basal leaves that are pinnately divided, with a distinctive ovate shape and a hairy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in rich, loamy soils near streams or in woodland areas. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, making it a characteristic component of wetland ecosystems."
