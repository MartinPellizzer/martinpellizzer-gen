    "intro": "Cenchrus sphacelatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions, making it a common component of dryland vegetation. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in marginal environments."
