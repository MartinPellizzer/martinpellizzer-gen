    "intro": "Caprifolium dentatum, commonly known as the common honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated margins, which give it its scientific name \"dentatum.\" The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its berries are red or orange and contain small, hard seeds. Caprifolium dentatum is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and moist soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators and wildlife."
