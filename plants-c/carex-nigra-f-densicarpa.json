    "intro": "Carex nigra f. densicarpa, commonly known as black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It features dark, glossy leaves that are typically arranged in dense, grass-like clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear dark brown to blackish flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Carex nigra f. densicarpa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
