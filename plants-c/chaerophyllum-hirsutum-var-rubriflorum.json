It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers range in color from white to deep red, depending on the variety, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps.
