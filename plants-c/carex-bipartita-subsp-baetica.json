    "intro": "Carex bipartita subsp. baetica, commonly known as the Iberian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southwestern Europe. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it a common component of wetland vegetation."
