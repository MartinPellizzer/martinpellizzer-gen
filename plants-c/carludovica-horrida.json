    "intro": "Carludovica horrida, commonly known as the spiny nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces berries that turn from green to red as they mature, often containing toxic compounds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to its spiny foliage and toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural areas."
