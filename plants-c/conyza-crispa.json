    "intro": "Conyza crispa, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is an annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are usually hairy and lobed. It is characterized by its ability to produce a large number of seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Conyza crispa is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
