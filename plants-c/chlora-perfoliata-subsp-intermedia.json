    "intro": "Chlora perfoliata subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate chlora, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its slender stems and heart-shaped leaves that often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the typical form of Chlora perfoliata."
