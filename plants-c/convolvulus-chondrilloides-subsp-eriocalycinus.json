    "intro": "Convolvulus chondrilloides subsp. eriocalycinus, commonly known as the pale morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is a climbing vine with hairy stems and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
