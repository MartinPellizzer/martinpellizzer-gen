It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are usually hairy and glandular, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer."
