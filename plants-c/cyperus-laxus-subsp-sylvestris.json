It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and wetlands. Its flowering structure consists of small, clustered inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Cyperus laxus subsp. sylvestris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
