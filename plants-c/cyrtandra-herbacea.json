    "intro": "Cyrtandra herbacea, commonly known as the brittle cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, herbaceous stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a distinctive corolla shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal or lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
