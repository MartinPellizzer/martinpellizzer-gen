    "intro": "Campanula coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. This species is typically found in rocky soils and open grasslands, where it thrives in full sun. Campanula coarctata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
