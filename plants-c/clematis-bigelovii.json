    "intro": "Clematis bigelovii, commonly known as the desert clematis, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a deciduous vine that typically grows along rocky slopes and in dry, well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of three to five oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a woody stem with thorn-like projections. Clematis bigelovii is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a hardy species in harsh desert environments."
