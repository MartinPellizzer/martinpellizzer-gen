    "intro": "Chytraculia selloana, commonly known as the Selloan chytraculia, is a species of flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers, and is characterized by its delicate, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive in the dappled light. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range in color from white to pale blue. Chytraculia selloana is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
