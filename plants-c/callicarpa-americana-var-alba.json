It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces striking clusters of bright red berries in the fall, which are a food source for birds and other wildlife. The leaves are simple, opposite, and have a slightly serrated margin. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens."
