    "intro": "Carduus tridentinus, commonly known as the threepinnate cocklebur, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant features spiny, lobed leaves and produces distinctive, spiky fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its prickly nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
