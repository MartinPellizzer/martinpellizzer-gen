    "intro": "Chamelaucium affine, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a reddish inner layer. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, with a leathery texture. Chamelaucium affine is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
