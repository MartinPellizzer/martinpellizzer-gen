    "intro": "Cleome fugax, commonly known as the \"spider flower,\" is an annual plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, spider-like flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and produces slender, branching stems that often grow upright. Cleome fugax thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, ornamental plant. Its rapid growth and short lifespan make it a fascinating subject in the study of annual flora."
