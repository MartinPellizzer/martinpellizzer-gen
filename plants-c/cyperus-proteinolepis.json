    "intro": "Cyperus proteinolepis, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense stands in shallow water or damp soil. Its slender, grass-like stems are usually unbranched, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
