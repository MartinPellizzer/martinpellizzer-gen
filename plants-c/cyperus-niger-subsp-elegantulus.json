    "intro": "Cyperus niger subsp. elegantulus, commonly known as black flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy habitats. It features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist soils. It is often found in temperate regions and can tolerate a range of soil conditions, though it prefers saturated or waterlogged environments. Due to its appearance and growth pattern, it is sometimes mistaken for other Cyperus species but can be distinguished by its subspecific traits."
