    "intro": "Coeloglossum viride var. virescens, commonly known as the green orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flowering stem that produces a cluster of greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps. It is a perennial herb that thrives in acidic soils and requires consistent moisture. The species is notable for its unusual coloration, as the flowers lack the typical vibrant hues seen in many orchids."
