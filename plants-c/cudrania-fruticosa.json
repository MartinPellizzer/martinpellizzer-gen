    "intro": "Cudrania fruticosa, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its woody stems and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Cudrania fruticosa is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
