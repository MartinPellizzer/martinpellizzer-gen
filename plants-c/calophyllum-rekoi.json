    "intro": "Calophyllum rekoi, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Africa, particularly found in countries like Nigeria and Cameroon. It belongs to the family Calophyllaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and fragrant, yellowish wood. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a leathery texture, contributing to its adaptability in various habitats. Due to its aromatic properties, Calophyllum rekoi has been used traditionally for its wood, which is valued for its scent and durability."
