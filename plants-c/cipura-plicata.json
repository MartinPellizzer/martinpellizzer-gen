    "intro": "Cipura plicata, commonly known as the pleated cipura, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, pleated leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Cipura plicata is often found in moist, mountainous habitats and is adapted to the cool, humid climates of its native range. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
