    "intro": "Cleistocactus serpens, commonly known as the serpent cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are often covered in a layer of white, waxy bloom. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that open only at night, a trait known as nyctinasty. Its adaptations include succulent stems for water storage and spines for protection against herbivores. Cleistocactus serpens is well-suited to harsh desert environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
