    "intro": "Ctenopterella boivinii, commonly known as the Boivin's feather fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a soft, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
