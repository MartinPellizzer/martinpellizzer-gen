    "intro": "Centaurea monticola subsp. perplexans, commonly known as the Alpine knapweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, with bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its inflorescence consists of a cluster of small, composite flower heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
