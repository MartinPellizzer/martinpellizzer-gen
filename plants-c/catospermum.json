    "intro": "Catospermum, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and forest edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Catospermum is also sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
