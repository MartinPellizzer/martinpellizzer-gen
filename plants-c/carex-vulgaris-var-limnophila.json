    "intro": "Carex vulgaris var. limnophila, commonly known as the water sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Carex vulgaris var. limnophila is valued for its ecological role in water filtration and as a food source for wildlife."
