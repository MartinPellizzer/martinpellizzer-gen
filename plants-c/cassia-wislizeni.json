    "intro": "Cassia wislizeni, commonly known as desert false acacia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow, fluffy flower clusters that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh desert conditions. Its seeds are encased in elongated pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Cassia wislizeni is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in some ecological restoration projects."
