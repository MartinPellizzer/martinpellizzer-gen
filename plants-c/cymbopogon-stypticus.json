    "intro": "Cymbopogon stypticus, commonly known as citronella grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often overlooked due to its primarily ornamental value. Citronella grass is widely cultivated for its essential oils, which are used in natural insect repellents. Its aromatic properties make it a popular choice in gardens and for commercial applications."
