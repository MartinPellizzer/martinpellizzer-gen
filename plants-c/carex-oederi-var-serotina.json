    "intro": "Carex oederi var. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom later in the growing season, typically in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland gardens and ecological restoration projects."
