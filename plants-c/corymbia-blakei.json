    "intro": "Corymbia blakei, commonly known as the Blake's bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that often appears reddish or brownish in color. The tree produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the winter months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The wood of Corymbia blakei is hard and durable, historically used by Indigenous Australians for tool-making and other purposes."
