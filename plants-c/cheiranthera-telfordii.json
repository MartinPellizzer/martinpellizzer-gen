    "intro": "Cheiranthera telfordii, commonly known as the Telford's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique morphology, featuring a single, slender stem and a single, showy white or pale green flower. The plant is characterized by its lack of leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its fleshy, green stem. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or on rocks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in its native range."
