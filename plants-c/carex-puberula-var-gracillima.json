    "intro": "Carex puberula var. gracillima, commonly known as slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetlands and moist habitats in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are softly hairy, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in shallow water or damp soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
