    "intro": "Caroxylon dealatum, commonly known as the desert broom. It is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowering stems produce clusters of yellowish-green flowers, which are adapted for pollination by wind or insects. Caroxylon dealatum is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
