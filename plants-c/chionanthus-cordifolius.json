    "intro": "Chionanthus cordifolius, commonly known as the heartleaf chionathus, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 3 to 6 inches long and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are borne on slender, drooping pedicels. Its foliage turns vibrant yellow in the fall, adding ornamental value to the landscape. Chionanthus cordifolius is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions."
