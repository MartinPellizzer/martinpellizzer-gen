    "intro": "Claytonia compacta, commonly known as the dwarf spring beauty, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features rosettes of spoon-shaped, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its compact growth habit and early blooming make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
