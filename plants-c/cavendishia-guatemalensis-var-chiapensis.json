    "intro": "Cavendishia guatemalensis var. chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas Cavendish, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the cloud forests of Chiapas, Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and clusters of vibrant, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces spiny areoles and has a distinctive, branched structure that allows it to thrive in its humid, shaded habitat. Its flowers are typically pollinated by nocturnal moths, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
