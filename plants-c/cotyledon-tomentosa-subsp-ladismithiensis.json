    "intro": "Cotyledon tomentosa subsp. ladismithiensis, commonly known as the Ladismith cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a dense, woolly coating. The leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps the plant store water and reduce transpiration. It produces small, vibrant flowers in shades of yellow or orange, which bloom in late summer. This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
