    "intro": "Cissus oblongolanceolata, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a climbing vine native to southern Africa. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by translucent, waxy berries that are edible for humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for tropical and subtropical landscapes."
