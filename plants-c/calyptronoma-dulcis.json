    "intro": "Calyptronoma dulcis, commonly known as the sweet calyptron, is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. Native to tropical regions of South America, this plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a velvety texture, while the flowers are usually pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Due to its ornamental value and unique floral structure, it is cultivated in some botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
