    "intro": "Cochlearia officinalis subsp. officinalis, commonly known as the common cochlearia, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, coastal areas, and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple, and it produces small, rounded seed pods that split open to release its seeds. The species has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
