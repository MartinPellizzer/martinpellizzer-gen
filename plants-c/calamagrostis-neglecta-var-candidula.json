    "intro": "Calamagrostis neglecta var. candidula, commonly known as the white false panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive silver-gray foliage that turns a soft white in the winter. The plant produces fluffy, panicle-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate ornamental touch to gardens. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is a popular choice for wetland restoration and naturalized landscapes."
