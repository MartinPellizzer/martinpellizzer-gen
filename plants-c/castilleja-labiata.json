    "intro": "Castilleja labiata, commonly known as the narrowleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, red-orange bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis through its green stems. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Castilleja labiata plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
