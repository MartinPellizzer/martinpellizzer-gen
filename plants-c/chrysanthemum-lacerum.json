    "intro": "Chrysanthemum lacerum, commonly known as the fringed chrysanthemum, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads. Chrysanthemum lacerum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
