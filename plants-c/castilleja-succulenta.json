    "intro": "Castilleja succulenta, commonly known as the slender Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, red-orange bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant has a slender, often branched stem and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. It forms symbiotic relationships with certain root systems of neighboring plants, drawing nutrients through its haustoria. Castilleja succulenta typically thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands."
