    "intro": "Cecropia polyandrophora, commonly known as the giant cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive, hollow stems that provide shelter for various species of ants. The plant forms a mutualistic relationship with certain ant species, which defend it from herbivores in exchange for shelter and nectar. It thrives in moist, disturbed habitats and is often found in secondary forests. Its rapid growth and ecological importance make it a significant component of tropical ecosystems."
