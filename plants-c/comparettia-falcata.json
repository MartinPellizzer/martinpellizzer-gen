It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often pendulous stems and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in a raceme. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
