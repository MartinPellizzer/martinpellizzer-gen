    "intro": "Cotula pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf daisy, is a small, flowering plant native to southern Africa. It produces delicate white or pale yellow flowers with a central yellow eye, resembling miniature daisies. The plant has a compact growth habit, typically reaching only a few centimeters in height. Cotula pygmaea thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its short lifespan and prolific seed production contribute to its ability to spread easily in suitable conditions."
