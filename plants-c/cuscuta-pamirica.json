    "intro": "Cuscuta pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange color and twining stems. The plant attaches to its host using specialized haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, including the mountainous areas of Central Asia. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and native vegetation."
