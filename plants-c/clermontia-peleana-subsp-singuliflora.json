    "intro": "Clermontia peleana subsp. singuliflora, commonly known as the single-flowered clermontia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, this subspecies is considered endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts in Hawaii."
