    "intro": "Cymba, commonly known as the shield fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are usually short and thick, anchoring the plant in the soil. Cymba species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens for their unique foliage."
