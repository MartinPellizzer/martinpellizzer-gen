    "intro": "Ceratopetalum apetalum, commonly known as the mountain snowbush, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has woody stems with a distinctive, gnarled appearance, and its leaves are narrow, leathery, and arranged in a spiral pattern. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or arid environments. The flowers are actinomorphic, with five petals that are fused at the base, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family."
