    "intro": "Callitriche glomerata, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often floating or submergent, and it produces tiny, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It is often found in still or slow-moving water, where it can spread via its rhizomes or by seed. Callitriche glomerata is an important part of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
