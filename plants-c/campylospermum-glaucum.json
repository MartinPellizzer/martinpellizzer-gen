It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
