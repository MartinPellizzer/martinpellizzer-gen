It features slender, grass-like leaves that are usually flat and arranged in a fan shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
