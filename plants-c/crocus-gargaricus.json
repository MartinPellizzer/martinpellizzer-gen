    "intro": "Crocus gargaricus, commonly known as the saffron crocus, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in the autumn. The plant produces a corm, a swollen underground stem that serves as a storage organ for nutrients. Its most notable feature is the stamen, which contains the vivid orange or red style and stigma, used in the production of saffron. The botanical name reflects its historical association with the saffron spice, derived from the stigmas of its flowers."
