    "intro": "Chrysosplenium nepalense var. vegetum, commonly known as the Nepalese golden spleenwort, is a member of the Saxifragaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions of Nepal and adjacent areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on alpine flora and plant adaptation."
