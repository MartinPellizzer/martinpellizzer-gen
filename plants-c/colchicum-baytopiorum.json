It belongs to the Colchicaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a tall stem with narrow, grass-like leaves and has a bulbous corm as its underground storage organ. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
