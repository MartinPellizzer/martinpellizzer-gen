    "intro": "Convolvulus guinensis, commonly known as the African morning glory, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from purple to blue. The plant belongs to the bindweed family (Convolvulaceae) and is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to climb using its twining stems. Its flowers open in the morning and close at dusk, hence its common name. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
