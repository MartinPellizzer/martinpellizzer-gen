    "intro": "Crenularia umbellata, commonly known as the star-shaped sandwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in umbels, which give it its scientific name. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. Crenularia umbellata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its delicate appearance and drought tolerance."
