    "intro": "Coursetia intermontana, commonly known as the mountain coursetia, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, gray-green leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to white flowers during the spring and early summer, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
