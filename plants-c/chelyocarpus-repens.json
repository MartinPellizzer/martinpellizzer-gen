    "intro": "Chelyocarpus repens, commonly known as the beach hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in sandy, saline soils and is often found in mangrove ecosystems. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the fruit is a capsule containing numerous small seeds. Chelyocarpus repens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various species."
