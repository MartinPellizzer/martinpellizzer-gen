    "intro": "Calopsis rigorata, commonly known as the hardy bluebell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Calopsis rigorata thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late winter to early spring."
