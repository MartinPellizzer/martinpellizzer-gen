    "intro": "Commelina caespitosa, commonly known as the spikemoss or swamp morning glory, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in the Americas. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, sandy soils, often found in marshes and along stream banks. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves with a fibrous root system, and it produces small, blue or violet flowers with three petals. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. The plant is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats, making it a common sight in riparian zones."
