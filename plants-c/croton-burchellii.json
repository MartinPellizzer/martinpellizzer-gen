    "intro": "Croton burchellii, commonly known as the Burchell's croton, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features alternate, ovate leaves that are often variegated with yellow and green patterns. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed capsules containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry savannas and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is generally drought-tolerant and requires minimal care."
