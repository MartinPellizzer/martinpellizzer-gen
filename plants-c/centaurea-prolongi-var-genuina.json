    "intro": "Centaurea prolongi var. genuina, commonly known as the slender cornflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its striking blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The variety 'genuina' is distinguished by its slender stems and smaller, more compact inflorescences compared to other varieties of Centaurea prolongi."
