    "intro": "Centaurea tatarica, commonly known as Tatarian knapweed, is a flowering plant native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and bright yellow to reddish-purple composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has lance-shaped leaves with rough, hairy surfaces. Centaurea tatarica is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native plants due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
