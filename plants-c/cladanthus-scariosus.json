    "intro": "Cladanthus scariosus, commonly known as the roughleaf thistle, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are covered in a rough, scaly texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
