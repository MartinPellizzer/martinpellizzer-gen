    "intro": "Calyptrogyne allenii subsp. centralis, commonly known as the Central Islands mangrove, is a tropical shrub native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in saline environments. It produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. This species plays an important ecological role in mangrove ecosystems, providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
