    "intro": "Celtis durandii, commonly known as the Durand's hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China and India. It belongs to the Ulmaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, round berries that mature to a dark purple color. Celtis durandii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its shade and seasonal interest. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
