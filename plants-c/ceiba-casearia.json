    "intro": "Ceiba casearia, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree produces small, red flowers that give way to winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
