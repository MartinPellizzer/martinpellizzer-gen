    "intro": "Cuscuta bracteosa, commonly known as the bracteate dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, adhesive pads that allow it to attach to its host. The plant is native to various regions of the Americas and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other plants. Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and then establishing a connection with the vascular system of its host. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken or even kill its host plants."
