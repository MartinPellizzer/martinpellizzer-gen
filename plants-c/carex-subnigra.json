    "intro": "Carex subnigra, commonly known as black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated. Carex subnigra is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
