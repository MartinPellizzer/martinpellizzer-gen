    "intro": "Cotyledon corymbosa, commonly known as the coral cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water and survive in arid conditions. Cotyledon corymbosa is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
