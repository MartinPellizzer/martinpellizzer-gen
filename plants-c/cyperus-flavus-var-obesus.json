    "intro": "Cyperus flavus var. obesus, commonly known as the fat chaffflower, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to brown flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swamps and roadside ditches. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. The species is characterized by its robust, fleshy stems and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance."
