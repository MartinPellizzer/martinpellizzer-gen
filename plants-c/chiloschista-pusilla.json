It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white in color. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to withstand salt spray and harsh weather conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
