    "intro": "Carex vesicaria var. physocarpa, commonly known as the bladder sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its cylindrical, leaf-like stems and clusters of small, greenish-brown spikelets that mature into bladder-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its unique seed capsules, which resemble bladders, are an adaptation for dispersal by water. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
