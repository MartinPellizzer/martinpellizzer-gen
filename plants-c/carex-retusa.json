    "intro": "Carex retusa, commonly known as smooth sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, cylindrical leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Carex retusa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse ecosystems."
