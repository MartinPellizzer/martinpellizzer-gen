    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe rhodotantha, commonly known as the red-veined staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that often have a reddish or brownish hue along the veins. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, helping it to anchor to its substrate and store moisture. The fronds are often divided into segments, giving the plant a distinctive, fern-like appearance."
