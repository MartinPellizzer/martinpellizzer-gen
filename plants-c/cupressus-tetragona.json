    "intro": "Cupressus tetragona, commonly known as the Arizona cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, columnar shape and scale-like leaves that are arranged in crossed pairs. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, and it has a deep root system that helps it thrive in arid environments. Its foliage is fragrant and often used in traditional medicine, while its wood is valued for its durability and resistance to decay. Cupressus tetragona is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
