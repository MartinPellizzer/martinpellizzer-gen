    "intro": "Ceratophyllum demersum var. pentacanthum, commonly known as the spiked watermilfoil, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, opposite leaves that are typically oval or spatulate in shape. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that are clustered in compact inflorescences, which emerge from the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats that can impact water quality and aquatic ecosystems. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a nuisance species in many regions."
