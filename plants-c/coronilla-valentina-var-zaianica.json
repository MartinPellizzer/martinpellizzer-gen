It features slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as hillsides and grasslands. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
