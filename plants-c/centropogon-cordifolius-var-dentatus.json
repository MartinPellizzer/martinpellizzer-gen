It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which give it its specific epithet \"dentatus.\" The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. The botanical interest of this species lies in its unique leaf morphology and its role in local ecosystems."
