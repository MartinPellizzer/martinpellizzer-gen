    "intro": "Chamaefistula bolivarensis, commonly known as the Bolivian boxwood, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the Andean regions of Bolivia. It belongs to the family Buxaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in cloud forests. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by red berries that attract birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
