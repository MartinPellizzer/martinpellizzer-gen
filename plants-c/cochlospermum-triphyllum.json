    "intro": "Cochlospermum triphyllum, commonly known as the three-leaved glorybower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces showy, red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its woody structure and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments make it a common ornamental species in horticulture. The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, red or yellow capsule that splits open when mature."
