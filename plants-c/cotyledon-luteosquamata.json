    "intro": "Cotyledon luteosquamata, commonly known as the yellow-squamate cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. The leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, providing a striking visual appearance."
