    "intro": "Corunastylis littoralis, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features slender, upright stems and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Corunastylis littoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native insects."
