    "intro": "Calamagrostis arenaria, commonly known as coastal panicgrass, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, silver-green blades that are often lined with fine hairs. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in coastal dunes and dry, open habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with red or purple at maturity. Calamagrostis arenaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
