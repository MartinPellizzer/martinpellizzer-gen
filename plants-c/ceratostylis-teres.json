    "intro": "Ceratostylis teres, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine. The species is relatively rare and requires specific conditions to thrive, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
