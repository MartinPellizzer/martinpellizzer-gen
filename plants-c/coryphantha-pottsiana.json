    "intro": "Coryphantha pottsiana, commonly known as the Potts' coryphantha, is a species of flowering plant in the Cactaceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It has spines that provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss through evaporation. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
