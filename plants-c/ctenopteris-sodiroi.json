    "intro": "Ctenopteris sodiroi, commonly known as the Bornean water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that are adapted for aquatic environments. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a long, creeping rhizome and a rosette of pinnate leaves. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Ctenopteris sodiroi plays an important ecological role in freshwater ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen."
