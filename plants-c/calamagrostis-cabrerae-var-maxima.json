    "intro": "Calamagrostis cabrerae var. maxima, commonly known as the giant calamagrostis, is a tall grass species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue at the edges. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and coastal gardens. Due to its hardiness and unique appearance, it is valued in both ecological and ornamental horticulture."
