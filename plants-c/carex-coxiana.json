    "intro": "Carex coxiana, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. Native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
