    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta var. flexuosa, commonly known as the hairy buttercup or flexible water crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, temperate regions. It typically grows in wet meadows, stream banks, and damp woodlands, where it thrives in partially shaded to sunny conditions. The plant features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in suitable habitats. Botanically, it is characterized by its unique leaf morphology and adaptability to wet environments."
