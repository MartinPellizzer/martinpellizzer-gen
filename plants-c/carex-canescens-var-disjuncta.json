    "intro": "Carex canescens var. disjuncta, commonly known as the disjunct sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is typically found in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. The plant plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
