It features showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive veined pattern. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires support for its vigorous growth. Clematis caleoides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to climb structures."
