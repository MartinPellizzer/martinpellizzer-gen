    "intro": "Caralluma acutangula, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spine-like, cylindrical stems that are covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments due to its ability to store water in its thick stems. Caralluma acutangula is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
