    "intro": "Coryphopteris seramensis, commonly known as the Seram rock fern, is a unique member of the Dryopteridaceae family, native to the island of Seram in Indonesia. This fern is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in rocky, shaded environments, often growing on cliffs or in crevices, which provides it with the necessary moisture and protection. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive, serrated margin. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
