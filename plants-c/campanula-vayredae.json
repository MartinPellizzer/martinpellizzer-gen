    "intro": "Campanula vayredae, commonly known as the Vayreda bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Campanula vayredae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
