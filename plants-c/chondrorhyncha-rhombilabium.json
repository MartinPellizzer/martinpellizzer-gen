    "intro": "Chondrorhyncha rhombilabium, commonly known as the diamond-lip orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, rhombus-shaped petals that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant has a short, sturdy stem with clustered, small orchid-like flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species."
