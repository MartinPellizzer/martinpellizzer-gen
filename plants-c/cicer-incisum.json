    "intro": "Cicer incisum, commonly known as the cutleaf vetch, is a leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are deeply lobed and often have a distinctive serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
