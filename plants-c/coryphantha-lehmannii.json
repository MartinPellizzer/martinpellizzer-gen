    "intro": "Coryphantha lehmannii, commonly known as Lehmann's hedgehog cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often segmented and covered in small, tubercles. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the areoles. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Coryphantha lehmannii is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
