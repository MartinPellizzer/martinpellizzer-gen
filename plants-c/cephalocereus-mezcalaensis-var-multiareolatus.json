    "intro": "Cephalocereus mezcalaensis var. multiareolatus, commonly known as the multi-areolate torch cactus, is a columnar cactus native to the Mexican state of Oaxaca. It features a tall, spiny stem with a distinctive multi-areolate structure, where the areoles are arranged in a complex, branching pattern. The plant produces large, white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
