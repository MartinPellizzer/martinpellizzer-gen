    "intro": "Cinnamomum, commonly known as cinnamon, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lauraceae. It includes several species, with Cinnamomum verum and Cinnamomum cassia being the most commercially important for their aromatic bark. The inner bark of the stems is harvested and dried to produce the spice cinnamon, which is widely used in cooking and traditional medicine. The plant is native to South Asia and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and fragrant, woody texture. Cinnamomum trees can grow up to 15 meters tall and thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
