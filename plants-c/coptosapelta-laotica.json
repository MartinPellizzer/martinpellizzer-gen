    "intro": "Coptosapelta laotica, commonly known as the Laos cycad, is a rare cycad species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered."
