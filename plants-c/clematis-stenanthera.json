    "intro": "Clematis stenanthera, commonly known as the white clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It features slender, twining stems that can grow up to 15 feet in length, allowing it to climb trees and other structures. The plant produces showy, fragrant white flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of three to five oval-shaped leaflets, and are typically arranged alternately along the stem. Clematis stenanthera thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
