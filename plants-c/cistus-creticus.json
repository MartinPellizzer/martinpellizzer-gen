    "intro": "Cistus creticus, commonly known as Cretan rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-green foliage and showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, glandular hairs that secrete a resinous substance, contributing to its distinctive scent. Cistus creticus is also known for its ability to support local pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
