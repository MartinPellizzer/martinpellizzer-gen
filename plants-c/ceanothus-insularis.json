    "intro": "Ceanothus insularis, commonly known as the Santa Cruz ceanothus, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and dry summers. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
