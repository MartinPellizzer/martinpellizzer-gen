    "intro": "Connarus andamanicus, commonly known as the Andaman woodvine, is a climbing plant native to the Andaman Islands. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
