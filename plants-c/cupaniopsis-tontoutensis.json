    "intro": "Cupaniopsis tontoutensis, commonly known as the Tontouta cupaniopsis, is a small evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a feature typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
