    "intro": "Chamaefilix resiliens, commonly known as the resilient rockfoil, is a hardy perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense clusters of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, oval-shaped berries. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating poor soil and extreme temperature fluctuations. Chamaefilix resiliens is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its resilience and ornamental value."
