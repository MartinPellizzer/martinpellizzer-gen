It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy, upright stems and alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and garden borders. Cerastium fastigiatum is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and ability to spread via runners."
