    "intro": "Celastrus cuneatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf staff-vine, is a climbing shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that contain several seeds. It thrives in woodland edges and moist soils, often forming dense thickets. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain regions."
