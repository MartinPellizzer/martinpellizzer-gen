    "intro": "Candollea adnata var. abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf candollea, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging species to cultivate outside its native range."
