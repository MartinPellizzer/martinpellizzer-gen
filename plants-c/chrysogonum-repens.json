    "intro": "Chrysogonum repens, commonly known as creeping goldenroot, is a perennial herb native to North America. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with fibrous roots and rhizomes that help it colonize various habitats. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in umbels and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Chrysogonum repens thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks."
