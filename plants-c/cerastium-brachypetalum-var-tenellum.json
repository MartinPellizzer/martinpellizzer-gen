    "intro": "Cerastium brachypetalum var. tenellum, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has rounded, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a common sight in temperate regions with cool, humid climates."
