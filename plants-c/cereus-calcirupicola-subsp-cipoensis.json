    "intro": "Cereus calcirupicola subsp. cipoensis, commonly known as the Cipo Cereus, is a flowering cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its columnar stem and spines, adapted to its arid and rocky habitat. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a feature common among many cacti in the Cereus genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Its subspecies status highlights its distinct ecological and morphological traits compared to other Cereus species."
