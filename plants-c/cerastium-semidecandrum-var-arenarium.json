It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters of five to ten. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand harsh conditions make it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
