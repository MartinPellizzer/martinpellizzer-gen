It is characterized by its large, basal leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a dense, globular inflorescence, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Cousinia gigantolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
