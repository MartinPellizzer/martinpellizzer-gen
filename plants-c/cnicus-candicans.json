    "intro": "Cnicus candicans, commonly known as the white bursch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a serrated edge, while the flowers are white with yellow centers. Cnicus candicans thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed ground."
