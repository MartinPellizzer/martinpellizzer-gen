    "intro": "Cyrtochilum cumandae, commonly known as the Cumand\u00e1 orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid forests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color, with a distinctive spurred lip. Cyrtochilum cumandae thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on the forest floor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
