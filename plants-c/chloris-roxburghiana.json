    "intro": "Chloris roxburghiana, commonly known as the slender grass or Indian arrowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Chloris roxburghiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
