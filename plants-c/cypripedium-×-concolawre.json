    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 concolawre, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and ornamental plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is a hybrid between Cypripedium calceolus (the showy lady's slipper) and Cypripedium pubescens (the yellow lady's slipper), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant is characterized by its large, showy, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white with a contrasting yellow lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Due to its rarity and beauty, it is highly valued in horticulture but is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
