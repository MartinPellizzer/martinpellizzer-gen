    "intro": "Carex vulgaris subsp. juncea, commonly known as narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, ditches, and along waterways. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a tight, cylindrical cluster. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
