    "intro": "Cyathula geminata, commonly known as the double-leaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, alternate leaves that often appear in pairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, which are specialized cup-like structures typical of the genus. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Cyathula geminata is also known for its latex-like sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
