It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane rainforests. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival. Its unique floral structure and restricted distribution make it a significant subject of botanical study."
