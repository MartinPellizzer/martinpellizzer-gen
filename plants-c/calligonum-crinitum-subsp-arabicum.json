    "intro": "Calligonum crinitum subsp. arabicum, commonly known as the Arabian goat's beard, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its grey-green, woolly leaves and long, drooping inflorescences that resemble a beard. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, saline soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures. It produces small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its resilience, it is often used in xeriscaping and for stabilizing sandy soils in desert environments."
