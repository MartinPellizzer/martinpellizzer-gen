It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Candollea armeria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
