    "intro": "Clematis patens var. floribunda, commonly known as the Chinese Clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features slender, flexible stems that can grow up to 10 meters in length, making it suitable for trellises or arbors. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
