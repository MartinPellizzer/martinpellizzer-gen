    "intro": "Casuarina distyla var. paludosa, commonly known as the swamp she-oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are arranged in cylindrical clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in wet, saline environments such as swamps and estuaries, making it well adapted to coastal and tidal zones. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by water. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
