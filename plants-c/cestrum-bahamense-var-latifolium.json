    "intro": "Cestrum bahamense var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a glossy green surface, and it produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but often have a mild toxic effect. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its night-blooming beauty."
