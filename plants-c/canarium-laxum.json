    "intro": "Canarium laxum, commonly known as the white candlenut tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, with smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, oval-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Its botanical significance lies in its use in traditional medicine and as a source of oil, which is derived from its seeds."
