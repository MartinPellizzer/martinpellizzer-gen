It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are usually wind-pollinated. Carex augustinowiczii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
