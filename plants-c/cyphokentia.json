    "intro": "Cyphokentia, commonly known as the cycad, is a primitive gymnosperm that belongs to the order Cycadales. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. Cyphokentia species are typically dioecious, with separate male and female plants, and they produce cones rather than flowers. These plants are adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and are often found in coastal areas or disturbed soils. Due to their ancient lineage, they are considered living fossils and have significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
