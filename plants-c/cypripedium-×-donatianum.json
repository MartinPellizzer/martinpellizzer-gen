    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 donatianum, commonly known as the Donatian lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium micranthum. It is characterized by its large, showy, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple with a yellow or orange lip. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it is often found in woodlands and alpine meadows. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
