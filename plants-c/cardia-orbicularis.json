    "intro": "Cardia orbicularis, commonly known as the heart-shaped liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive orbicular, or heart-shaped, thallus that is typically green and grows close to the ground. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple structure composed of a single layer of cells. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid regions with rich soil. Cardia orbicularis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various small organisms."
