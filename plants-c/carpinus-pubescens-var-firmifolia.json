    "intro": "Carpinus pubescens var. firmifolia, commonly known as the hairy hornbeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically pubescent on both surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by small, woody fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
