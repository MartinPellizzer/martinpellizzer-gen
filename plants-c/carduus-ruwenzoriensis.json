    "intro": "Carduus ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori thistle, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Ruwenzori Mountains in Uganda and Tanzania. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, silvery-green leaves that are adapted to the cold and arid conditions of its habitat. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found growing in open grasslands and along mountain ridges. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
