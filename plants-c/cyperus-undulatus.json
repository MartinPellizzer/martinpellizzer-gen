    "intro": "Cyperus undulatus, commonly known as the zigzag sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, often arranged in spikelets. Cyperus undulatus thrives in wet or marshy environments, making it a common sight in swampy areas and along water bodies. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged soil makes it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
