    "intro": "Coffea neoarnoldiana, commonly known as the Arnold's coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the highlands of Ethiopia and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red berries containing two seeds, which are used to make a mild coffee. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and lesser-known coffee species."
