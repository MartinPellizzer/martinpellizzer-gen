    "intro": "Convolvulus saxatilis var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy rock bindweed, is a flowering plant native to rocky and coastal areas of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, hairy textures. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in some regions."
