    "intro": "Cyperus spadiceus, commonly known as the spike rush, is a perennial wetland plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in moist to aquatic environments such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Cyperus spadiceus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
