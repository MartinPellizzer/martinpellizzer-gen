    "intro": "Cabralea polytricha var. brevipaniculata, commonly known as the short-bracted cabralea, is a rare shrub native to the cloud forests of central Mexico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which are shorter and more compact compared to the typical form. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
