    "intro": "Cissus adenopoda, commonly known as the rock fig or climbing fig, is a tropical vine native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, raised glands. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically yellow or red when mature. Cissus adenopoda thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or trees in its natural habitat. Its rapid growth and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and green wall installations."
