It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, stiff leaves that can reach significant heights. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a tall, cylindrical spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in stabilizing soil in natural habitats."
