    "intro": "Cousinia catenata, commonly known as the chaincup fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cousinia catenata produces small yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
