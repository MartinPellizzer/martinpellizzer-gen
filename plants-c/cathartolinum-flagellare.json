    "intro": "Cathartolinum flagellare, commonly known as the whiplash fern, is a unique vascular plant characterized by its elongated, whip-like fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant's fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its rhizome system is highly specialized, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Due to its rare occurrence and ecological significance, Cathartolinum flagellare is considered a conservation priority in its native habitats."
