    "intro": "Circaea lutetiana var. mairei, commonly known as the Maire's white Campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of white, pink, or red flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often prostrate. This variety is distinguished from the typical form by its more compact growth and variations in flower color."
