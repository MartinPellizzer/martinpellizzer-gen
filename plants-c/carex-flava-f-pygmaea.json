It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright yellow to golden green in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to brownish flowers during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is a popular choice for water garden and bog garden settings."
