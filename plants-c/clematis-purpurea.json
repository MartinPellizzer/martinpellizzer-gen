It features showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with a distinctive violet hue. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Clematis purpurea is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
