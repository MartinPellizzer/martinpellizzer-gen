    "intro": "Cereus cubensis, commonly known as the night bloomer cactus, is a species native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a columnar cactus with a tall, spiny stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Cereus cubensis is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun with minimal water."
