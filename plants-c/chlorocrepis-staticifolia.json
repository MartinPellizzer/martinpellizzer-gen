    "intro": "Chlorocrepis staticifolia, commonly known as the sticky weed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically short-lived and appear in early spring. Its leaves are simple, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, sticky hairs that help deter herbivores. The species is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands."
