    "intro": "Corydalis aurea var. crystallina, commonly known as the crystalline goldroot, is a delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and unique floral structure, it is often cultivated for both its beauty and its role in supporting local pollinators."
