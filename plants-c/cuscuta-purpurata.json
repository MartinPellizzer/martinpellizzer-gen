    "intro": "Cuscuta purpurata, commonly known as the purple dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique appearance with thread-like, orange-red stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and can be found on a variety of host species, including grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked."
