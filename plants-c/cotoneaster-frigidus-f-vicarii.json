    "intro": "Cotoneaster frigidus f. vicarii, commonly known as the alpine cotoneaster, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
