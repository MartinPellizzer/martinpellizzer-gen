    "intro": "Cardamine glacialis var. variabilis, commonly known as the alpine watercress, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky stream banks and alpine meadows. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a peppery aroma, and its small white flowers are borne in clusters. It has a robust root system that helps it anchor in loose, rocky soils. This variant is notable for its adaptability to cold climates and is often found at high altitudes."
