    "intro": "Cistus ladanifer f. discolor, commonly known as the pale-flowered rockrose, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and pale pink to white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a resinous substance called ladanum, which has been historically used in perfumery and traditional medicine. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife further highlight its botanical significance."
