    "intro": "Calcalia, commonly known as the frost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa, particularly in regions with arid and semi-arid climates. Calcalia species are characterized by their small, succulent leaves and showy, star-shaped flowers that often bloom in spring. They are typically low-growing, forming dense mats or compact shrubs. Due to their unique appearance and adaptability to harsh environments, they are popular among succulent enthusiasts and gardeners in dry climates."
