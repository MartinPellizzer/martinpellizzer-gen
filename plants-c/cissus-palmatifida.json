It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental use in shaded or semi-shaded gardens."
