    "intro": "Cyathea macropoda, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer of old fronds. The plant produces large, shield-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea macropoda reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. This species plays an important ecological role in tropical rainforests, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various organisms."
