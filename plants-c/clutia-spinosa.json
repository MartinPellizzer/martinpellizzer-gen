    "intro": "Clutia spinosa, commonly known as the African spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, green, spiny leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which can be harmful if ingested. Clutia spinosa is often found in moist, shaded areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its growth habit makes it a common weed in disturbed soils across its native range."
