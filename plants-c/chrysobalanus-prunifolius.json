    "intro": "Chrysobalanus prunifolius, commonly known as the sweet apple of the sea, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, orange-red fruits resembling small apples. The fruits are rich in nutrients and have a sweet, tart flavor, making them valuable both nutritionally and economically. It thrives in sandy or limestone soils and is often found in mangrove ecosystems along the coast."
