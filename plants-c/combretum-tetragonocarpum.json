    "intro": "Combretum tetragonocarpum, commonly known as the four-angled fruit combretum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly pubescent surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by four-angled, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and savanna habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local medicine."
