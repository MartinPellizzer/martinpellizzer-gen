    "intro": "Chrysodium palustre, commonly known as the marsh chrysanthemum, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, upright stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs and swampy areas. Chrysodium palustre plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various insects."
