    "intro": "Carex compacta, commonly known as compact sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, grasses, and reeds. This plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, bogs, and along stream banks. Its compact growth habit and dense foliage make it a useful plant for erosion control and wetland restoration. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges."
