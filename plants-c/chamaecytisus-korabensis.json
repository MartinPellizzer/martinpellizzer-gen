    "intro": "Chamaecytisus korabensis, commonly known as the Korab rose or Korab buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
