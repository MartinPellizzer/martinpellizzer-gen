It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive hairy texture on both surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow, bell-shaped flowers that are followed by elongated, spiny fruits. Its botanical structure includes a robust stem with tendrils for climbing support. The varietal name subintegrifolia refers to its nearly entire leaf margins, which are slightly toothed."
