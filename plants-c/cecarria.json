    "intro": "Cecarria, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with prominent red stamens, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cecarria is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its fibrous stems and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties."
