    "intro": "Catevala \u00d7 hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid cactus, is a fascinating plant that results from the crossbreeding of two distinct cactus species. It typically exhibits a combination of traits from its parent plants, such as unique spines, varied coloration, and distinctive growth patterns. The plant is characterized by its succulent stems, which store water to help it survive in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
