    "intro": "Conopharyngia crassa, commonly known as the roughleaf bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap air and help it float on the water surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are simple and often have a rough texture, contributing to its common name. Conopharyngia crassa is a carnivorous plant, using its specialized structures to capture and digest small aquatic organisms."
