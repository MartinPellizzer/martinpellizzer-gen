    "intro": "Calonemorchis necrophylla, commonly known as the death's-head orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, dark purple to black flowers that resemble a skull, giving it its ominous common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Calonemorchis necrophylla is considered endangered in many regions."
