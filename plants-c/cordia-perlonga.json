    "intro": "Cordia perlonga, commonly known as the long-stemmed cordia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by elongated, fleshy fruits. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Cordia perlonga is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
