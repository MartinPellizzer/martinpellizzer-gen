    "intro": "Cytisus arboreus var. extravagans, commonly known as the Spanish broom, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe. It features slender, often twisted stems that are covered in small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant has pinnate leaves composed of several small, oval leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in coastal or rocky areas. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
