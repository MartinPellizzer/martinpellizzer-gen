    "intro": "Chromolaena xestolepidoides, commonly known as croftonweed, is a tropical plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It is an invasive species in many regions, often outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a significant ecological concern in disturbed habitats."
