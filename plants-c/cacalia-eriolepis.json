    "intro": "Cacalia eriolepis, commonly known as the hairy cacalia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of many small florets. The plant is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which provide a unique texture and aid in water retention. Its small, daisy-like flowers are typically white or pale yellow, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. Cacalia eriolepis is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cooler, high-altitude environments."
