    "intro": "Cuphea hirta, commonly known as the woolly cuphea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and purple, often arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. It thrives in warm, humid climates and prefers well-draining soil. Cuphea hirta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant blooms and drought tolerance."
