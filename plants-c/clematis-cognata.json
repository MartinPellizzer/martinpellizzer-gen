    "intro": "Clematis cognata, commonly known as the Japanese vine or white clematis, is a deciduous climbing plant native to East Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces showy, white to pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has a vigorous growth habit and can reach lengths of up to 15 feet, making it ideal for trellises or arbors. Its flowers are fragrant and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Clematis cognata requires well-drained soil and partial to full sun for optimal growth and flowering."
