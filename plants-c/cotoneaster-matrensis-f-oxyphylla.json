    "intro": "Cotoneaster matrensis f. oxyphylla, commonly known as the Alpine cotoneaster, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a dense, mat-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It is adapted to cold, alpine environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
