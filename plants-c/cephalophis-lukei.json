    "intro": "Cephalophis lukei, commonly known as the Luke's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant produces small, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found growing on tree trunks or branches, a trait known as epiphytism. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cephalophis lukei is considered a critically endangered species."
