    "intro": "Coccothrinax savannarum, commonly known as the Bahama palm, is a distinctive palm species native to the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. It is a small, multi-trunked palm with a short, sturdy stem and a crown of stiff, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into round, red fruits, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in coastal and sandy habitats, often found in dry, well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is a key component of the island's flora."
