    "intro": "Caulinia monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf caulinia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, large, palmate leaf that emerges directly from the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
