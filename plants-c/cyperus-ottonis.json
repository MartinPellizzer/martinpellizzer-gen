    "intro": "Cyperus ottonis, commonly known as the silver grass or Otto's flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Cyperus ottonis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats."
