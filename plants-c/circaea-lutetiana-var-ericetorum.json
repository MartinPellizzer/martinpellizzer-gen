It typically thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in heathlands, woodland edges, and rocky areas. The plant features small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its habitat. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is closely related to other members of the Geraniaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
