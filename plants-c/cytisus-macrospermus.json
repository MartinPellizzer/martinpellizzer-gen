    "intro": "Cytisus macrospermus, commonly known as the large-seeded broom, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are typical of the Fabaceae (legume) family. Its pods contain seeds that are adapted for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread across open habitats. Cytisus macrospermus is well-suited to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
