    "intro": "Cuphea pterosperma, commonly known as the featherleaf cuphea, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, feather-like leaves that give it its common name, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant flowers and compact growth habit. Cuphea pterosperma is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers."
