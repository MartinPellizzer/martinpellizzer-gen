    "intro": "Cnicus pratensis, commonly known as the common cat's-paw, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that grows up to 60 cm tall, featuring bright yellow flowers that bloom from June to August. The plant has palmately lobed leaves with hairy surfaces and distinctive, inflated seed pods that burst to disperse seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Cnicus pratensis is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
