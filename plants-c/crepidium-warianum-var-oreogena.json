    "intro": "Crepidium warianum var. oreogena, commonly known as the alpine orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species found in high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, thriving in cool, moist environments with limited sunlight. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
