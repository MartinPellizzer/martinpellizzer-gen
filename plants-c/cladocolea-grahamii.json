    "intro": "Cladocolea grahamii, commonly known as the Graham's leathery lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form and a dark, almost black or brownish thallus that adheres tightly to rock surfaces. The lichen typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often on exposed rock faces or soil in dry regions. It is known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions due to its protective thallus structure. Cladocolea grahamii is of interest to botanists and lichenologists due to its ecological significance and unique adaptations to extreme environments."
