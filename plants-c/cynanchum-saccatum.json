    "intro": "Cynanchum saccatum, commonly known as the sac-like milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, including China and the Russian Far East. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which is known for its milky sap and showy flowers. The plant features opposite, lanceolate leaves with a rough texture and produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Cynanchum saccatum is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
