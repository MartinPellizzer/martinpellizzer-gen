    "intro": "Crocus clusii, commonly known as the Clusius crocus, is a species of flowering plant in the Iridaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, where it thrives in woodland and meadow environments. The plant produces striking, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted for storing nutrients, allowing it to survive dormant periods during winter. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from the base of the plant."
