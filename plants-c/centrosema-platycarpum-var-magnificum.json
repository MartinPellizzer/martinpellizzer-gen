    "intro": "Centrosema platycarpum var. magnificum, commonly known as the giant hairy bean, is a tropical legume native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, hairy pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It is often used in agroforestry systems due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and forage value. Its growth habit makes it suitable for erosion control and as a cover crop in humid climates."
