    "intro": "Cousinia blepharobasis, commonly known as the narrowleaf cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cousinia blepharobasis produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
