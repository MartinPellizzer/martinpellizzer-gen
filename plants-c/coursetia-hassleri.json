    "intro": "Coursetia hassleri, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, leathery leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its root system is adapted to drought conditions, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Coursetia hassleri is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for desert wildlife."
