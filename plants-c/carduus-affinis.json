    "intro": "Carduus affinis, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in dry, disturbed soils. Its leaves are covered in a layer of fine hairs, which contribute to its rough texture. Carduus affinis is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
