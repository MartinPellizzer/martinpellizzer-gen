    "intro": "Cybianthus huampamiensis, commonly known as the Huampam\u00ed flower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in southern Peru. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant is known for its striking, showy yellow-orange inflorescences that bloom during the dry season. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
