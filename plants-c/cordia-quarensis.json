    "intro": "Cordia quarensis, commonly known as the red cedar or white cedar, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and small, ovate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by round, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed. Cordia quarensis is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to salt spray and sandy soils. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
