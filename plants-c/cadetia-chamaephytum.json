    "intro": "Cadetia chamaephytum, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
