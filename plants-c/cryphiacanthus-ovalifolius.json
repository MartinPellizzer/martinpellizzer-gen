    "intro": "Cryphiacanthus ovalifolius, commonly known as the African violet, is a tropical plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are oval-shaped and have a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated as a houseplant."
