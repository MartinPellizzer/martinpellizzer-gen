    "intro": "Ctenium chapadense, commonly known as Brazilian sandgrass, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Ctenium chapadense is often found in sandy or coastal areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
