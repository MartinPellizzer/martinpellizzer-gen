    "intro": "Corispermum pseudofalcatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf corisperm, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Chenopodiaceae. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it produces small, dry fruits known as utricles. The species is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
