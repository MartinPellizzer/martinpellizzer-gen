    "intro": "Cedrela occidentalis, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to western Africa. It is characterized by its straight-grained, pale to golden yellow wood, which is highly valued for its durability and workability. The plant typically grows in moist lowland forests and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, while its flowers are small and yellowish-green, arranged in panicles. The tree produces woody capsules that contain flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
