    "intro": "Cerophora angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cerophora, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its narrow, lance-shaped leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. Cerophora angustifolia is often found in fynbos vegetation and is adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate."
