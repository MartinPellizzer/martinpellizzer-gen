    "intro": "Cheilanthes clelandii, commonly known as the Cleland's shield fern, is a species of fern native to Australia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive shield-shaped appearance, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in rocky or arid environments, often growing on limestone or sandstone substrates. This resilient fern is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in coastal regions of southern Australia."
