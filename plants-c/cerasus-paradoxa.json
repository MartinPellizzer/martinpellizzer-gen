    "intro": "Cerasus paradoxa, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or the paradoxa cherry, is a species of Prunus native to Japan. It is characterized by its striking, double flowers that bloom in early spring, often in shades of pink and white. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in the autumn, and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its fruit, a small, tart cherry, is edible but not commonly cultivated for consumption. The tree is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often planted in gardens and parks."
