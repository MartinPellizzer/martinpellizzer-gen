    "intro": "Carex deflexa var. media, commonly known as the broadleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife."
