    "intro": "Chilopogon bracteatum var. ovale, commonly known as the oval bracteatum, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, ovate-shaped bracts that encase its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its botanical features include slender stems and lanceolate leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
