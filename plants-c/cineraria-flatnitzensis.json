    "intro": "Cineraria flatnitzensis, commonly known as the Flatnitz Alpine cineraria, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Dolomites in Italy. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. Its leaves are elongated and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The flowers, which bloom in late summer, are usually blue or purple and are adapted to attract pollinators in its mountainous habitat."
