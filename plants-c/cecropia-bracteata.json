    "intro": "Cecropia bracteata, commonly known as the giant cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive, showy bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is often found in disturbed habitats such as clearings and along roadsides. It has a symbiotic relationship with ants, which live in the hollow stems and protect the tree from herbivores. Its rapid growth makes it an important component of secondary forests and a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
