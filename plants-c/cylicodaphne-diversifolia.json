    "intro": "Cylicodaphne diversifolia, commonly known as the variegated sago palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery, pinnate leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
