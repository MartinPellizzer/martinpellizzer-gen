    "intro": "Caladenia vulgaris, commonly known as the common spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is found in regions with a temperate climate. The plant produces a single, slender stem that bears a single, intricate orchid flower with a distinctive spider-like appearance. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a darkened lip that enhances its visual appeal. Caladenia vulgaris is known for its resilience and is often seen blooming in late winter to early spring."
