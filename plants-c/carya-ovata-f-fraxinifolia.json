    "intro": "Carya ovata f. fraxinifolia, commonly known as the silky walnut, is a botanical variant of the Persian walnut. It is characterized by its elongated, ovate leaves that are finely toothed and have a silvery underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its fruit is a drupe with a thick, leathery husk enclosing a single nut. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often grown in gardens for its aesthetic foliage and autumn color."
