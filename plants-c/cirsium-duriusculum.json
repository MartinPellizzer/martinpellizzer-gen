    "intro": "Cirsium duriusculum, commonly known as the rough thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. The plant features a robust, spiny stem and large, blue to purple flowering heads that are surrounded by a series of bracts. Its leaves are lance-shaped, rough to the touch, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its defensive characteristics. The rough thistle plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often considered a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
