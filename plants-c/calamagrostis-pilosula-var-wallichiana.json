It features slender, silver-green leaves with a fine, silky texture that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces delicate, feathery panicles of pale to golden flowers in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ornamental grass in temperate climates. Its elegant form and seasonal flowering make it a valued addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes."
