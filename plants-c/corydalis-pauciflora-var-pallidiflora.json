It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its slender, creeping stems and delicate foliage. The flowers are typically pale pink to white, with two lower petals that are spurred at the base. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This variant is distinguished by its reduced flower count compared to other Corydalis species."
