    "intro": "Cypripedium calceolus proles biflorum, commonly known as the bifloral lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome and thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it is listed as a protected species due to habitat loss and over-collection. This orchid is known for its slow growth and long dormancy periods, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes."
