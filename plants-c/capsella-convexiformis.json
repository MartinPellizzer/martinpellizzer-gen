    "intro": "Capsella convexiformis, commonly known as the broadleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in various habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. Its seeds are encased in a hard, dry fruit called a silique, which splits open to release the seeds. Capsella convexiformis is also known for its ability to thrive in a wide range of environmental conditions."
