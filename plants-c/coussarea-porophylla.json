    "intro": "Coussarea porophylla, commonly known as the red-leaved coussarea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its striking, glossy red foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ornamental value is largely due to its vibrant leaves, which remain colorful throughout the growing season. Coussarea porophylla is typically found in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical forests and undergrowth."
