    "intro": "Carex brizoides var. campestris, commonly known as the field sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled berries. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
