    "intro": "Cynanchum watsonianum, commonly known as the Watson's milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its milky sap. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Cynanchum watsonianum is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
