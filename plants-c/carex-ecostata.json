    "intro": "Carex ecostata, commonly known as the coastal sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, sandy or gravelly soils along shores, dunes, and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often densely packed, forming a dense mat. Its flowering spikes are usually clustered at the base, producing small, greenish to brownish flowers. Carex ecostata is valued for its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for coastal wildlife."
