    "intro": "Cryptocentrum misasii, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of its fronds, facilitating spore dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
