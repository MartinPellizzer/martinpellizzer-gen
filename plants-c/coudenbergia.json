    "intro": "Coudenbergia, commonly known as the African sycamore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Coudenbergia lobata, which is native to tropical Africa. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces showy, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Coudenbergia is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
