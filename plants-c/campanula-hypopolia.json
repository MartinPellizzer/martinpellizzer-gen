    "intro": "Campanula hypopolia, commonly known as the lesser bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps retain moisture. Campanula hypopolia is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
