    "intro": "Coffea augagneurii, commonly known as the Augagneur's coffee, is a rare and little-known species within the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of western Africa, specifically Cameroon and the Central African Republic. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces small, white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. It is primarily grown in shaded, humid conditions and requires careful cultivation due to its sensitivity to environmental changes. Despite its potential, it remains largely unexploited for commercial coffee production."
