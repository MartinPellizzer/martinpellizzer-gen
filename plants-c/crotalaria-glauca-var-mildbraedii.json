    "intro": "Crotalaria glauca var. mildbraedii, commonly known as the smallleaf velvetleaf, is a tropical annual herb native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and palmately lobed leaves. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is commonly used as a forage crop in some regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia. However, it is also considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
