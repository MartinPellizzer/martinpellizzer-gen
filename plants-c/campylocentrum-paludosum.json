    "intro": "Campylocentrum paludosum, commonly known as the swamp hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant typically grows in wetlands and swampy areas, adapting to waterlogged soils with its fibrous root system. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often hairy and slightly woody. Campylocentrum paludosum plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
