    "intro": "Cynanchum ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaved dogbane, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Cynanchum ovalifolium is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
