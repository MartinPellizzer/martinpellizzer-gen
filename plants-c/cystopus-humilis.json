    "intro": "Cystopus humilis, commonly known as the common rock-cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops and weeds. The plant typically features small, basal leaves that are lobed or divided, and it produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers in early spring. Cystopus humilis thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its structure and growth habits make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
