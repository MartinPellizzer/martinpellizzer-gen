    "intro": "Centroclinium adpressum, commonly known as the narrowleaf centipede plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa. It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight. Due to its compact growth habit, it is often used in rock gardens or as a foreground plant in succulent arrangements."
