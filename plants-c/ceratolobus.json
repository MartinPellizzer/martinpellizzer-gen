    "intro": "Ceratolobus, commonly known as the desert thorn, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Fabaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. They are characterized by their woody stems, thorny branches, and small, often clustered leaves. The flowers are typically pea-shaped, with a distinctive hooded structure, and they produce pods that contain edible seeds. Ceratolobus species are adapted to survive in harsh environments, making them important for soil stabilization and forage in dry ecosystems."
