    "intro": "Crocus pallidus, commonly known as the pale crocus, is a species of flowering plant in the Iridaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, typically growing in rocky or limestone soils. The plant produces small, delicate flowers with pale yellow petals that bloom in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted to survive harsh winters, and it thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions. The pale crocus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its subtle, early-season blooms."
