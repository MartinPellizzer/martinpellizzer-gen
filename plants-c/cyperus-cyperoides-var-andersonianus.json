It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowering spikes. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Its botanical characteristics make it a common indicator species in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
