It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a defining feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are broad and leathery, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to its beauty and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is considered a symbol of elegance and resilience in the plant world."
