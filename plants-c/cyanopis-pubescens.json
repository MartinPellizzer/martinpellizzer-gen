    "intro": "Cyanopis pubescens, commonly known as the hairy blueberry, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, blue-black berries that are covered in a fine, pubescent layer. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a serrated margin and a glossy, dark green upper surface. Cyanopis pubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and edible fruits."
