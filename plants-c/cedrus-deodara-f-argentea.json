    "intro": "Cedrus deodara f. argentea, commonly known as the silver cedar, is a cultivar of the deodar cedar. It is characterized by its silvery-blue foliage, which results from dense, overlapping scales on the leaves. This ornamental tree is native to the western Himalayas but is widely cultivated for its aesthetic appeal. The plant typically grows as a coniferous evergreen with a pyramidal shape. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes in temperate climates."
