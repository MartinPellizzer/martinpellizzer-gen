    "intro": "Campomanesia schultziana, commonly known as the Brazilian wax apple, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange fruits that are covered in a waxy coating. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with opposite, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its flowers are white or pale pink, and it produces a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. The fruit is edible, though it is not widely cultivated for commercial use."
