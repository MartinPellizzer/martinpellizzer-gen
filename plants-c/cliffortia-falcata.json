    "intro": "Cliffortia falcata, commonly known as the Cape sugarbush, is a succulent shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to rocky, sunny environments and is often found growing on coastal cliffs and slopes. Its ability to store water in its thick stems makes it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping."
