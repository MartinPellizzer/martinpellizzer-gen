    "intro": "Cussetia, commonly known as the marsh hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in wetland and marshy habitats. They typically feature showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored, ranging from pink to red. The leaves are usually heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are often succulent and can store water. Cussetia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
