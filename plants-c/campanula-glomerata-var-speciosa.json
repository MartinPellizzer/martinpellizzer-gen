    "intro": "Campanula glomerata var. speciosa, commonly known as the showy bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces a cylindrical stem that supports the inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
