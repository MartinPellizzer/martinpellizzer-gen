    "intro": "Cyperus helodes, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial wetland plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread rapidly in wet environments. It is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and rivers. Its adaptability makes it both an important part of wetland ecosystems and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
