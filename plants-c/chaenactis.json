    "intro": "Chaenactis, commonly known as the plains mouse-ear or golden crownbeard, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions of North America, where they thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Chaenactis species are characterized by their basal rosettes of narrow, silver-gray leaves and showy yellow or white composite flowers. They are often adapted to survive in harsh environments through mechanisms such as succulence and deep root systems. Many species are used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
