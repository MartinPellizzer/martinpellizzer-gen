    "intro": "Carya ovalis f. acuta, commonly known as the sharp-nut hickory, is a variant of the winged hickory native to the eastern United States. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its oval-shaped leaves with a serrated margin and a distinctive, elongated fruit that contains a single, sharp-pointed nut. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its bark is rugged and furrowed, becoming more deeply grooved with age. The plant is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
