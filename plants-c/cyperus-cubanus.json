    "intro": "Cyperus cubanus, commonly known as the Cuban flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas, including Cuba, and thrives in wetland environments such as marshes and pond margins. The plant has slender, triangular stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically arranged in spikelets, and it produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by water. Cyperus cubanus plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
