    "intro": "Coccothrinax yuraguana var. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental palm, is a member of the Arecaceae family and is native to the Caribbean. It is a small, slender palm characterized by its stiff, clustered leaves and smooth, grayish trunk. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by round, fibrous fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in sandy soils with good drainage. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
