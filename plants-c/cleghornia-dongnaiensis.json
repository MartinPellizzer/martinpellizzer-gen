It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and riverbanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slight hairy texture. Due to habitat loss, Cleghornia dongnaiensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
