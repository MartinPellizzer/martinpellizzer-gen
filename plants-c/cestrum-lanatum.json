    "intro": "Cestrum lanatum, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a shrub native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several small, dark berries. Cestrum lanatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and nocturnal fragrance, though it contains toxic compounds in its leaves and berries."
