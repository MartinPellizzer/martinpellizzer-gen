    "intro": "Coreopsis grandiflora var. longipes, commonly known as the longpod coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can grow up to 3 feet in height. The plant produces bright yellow, daisy-like flowers with a prominent central disk, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This variety is well-suited for gardens and natural habitats due to its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
