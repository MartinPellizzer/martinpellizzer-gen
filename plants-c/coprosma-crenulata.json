    "intro": "Coprosma crenulata, commonly known as the silver coprosma, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white or pale green powdery coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by dark blue or black berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and forested areas. Coprosma crenulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in horticulture for its attractive foliage and resilience."
