    "intro": "Centaurea monocephala, commonly known as the single-headed centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces achene fruits, which are small, dry, and typically have a pappus for wind dispersal. Centaurea monocephala is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained conditions."
