    "intro": "Croton baccifer, commonly known as the red-berried croton, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored leaves that can range from green to red or purple. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically red when mature, containing seeds enclosed in a gelatinous pulp. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests or along riverbanks."
