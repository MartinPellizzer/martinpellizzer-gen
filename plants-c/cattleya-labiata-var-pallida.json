    "intro": "Cattleya labiata var. pallida, commonly known as the pale-lipped cattleya, is a hybrid orchid prized for its elegant, fragrant flowers. This variety is characterized by its pale pink to white petals and a distinctive, pale lip that sets it apart from other cattleya species. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a striking visual element to gardens and greenhouses."
