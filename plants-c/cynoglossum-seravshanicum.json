    "intro": "Cynoglossum seravshanicum, commonly known as the Armenian dead-nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Its common name reflects its resemblance to the dead-nettle genus, though it is not closely related."
