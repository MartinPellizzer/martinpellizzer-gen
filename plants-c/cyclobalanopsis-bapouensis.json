    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis bapouensis, commonly known as the Bapou ebony, is a species of evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of West Africa. It belongs to the family Fagaceae, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, dense wood. The plant produces small, cupule-enclosed nuts that are typically dispersed by animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of primary forests. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable but threatened species."
