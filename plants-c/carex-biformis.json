    "intro": "Carex biformis, commonly known as the two-lobed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces three-sided, three-rowed seeds. Carex biformis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
