    "intro": "Capparis aegyptia, commonly known as Egyptian caper, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa. It produces small, pale green or yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, sour-tasting berries. The plant has thick, woody stems and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. The berries are harvested before they fully ripen and are used in culinary applications, particularly in Mediterranean cuisines."
