It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its lanceolate, glossy leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The tree produces woody, aromatic fruits that contain several seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in traditional crafts and furniture. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts."
