It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically green and covered with spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, spherical fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
