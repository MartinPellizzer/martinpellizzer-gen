    "intro": "Crepinella chimantensis var. iluensis, commonly known as the Iluensis crepefruit, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Ecuador. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, thick, and fleshy fruits that resemble small, elongated crepes. The plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, often in cloud forest environments. Its leaves are broad and glossy, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
