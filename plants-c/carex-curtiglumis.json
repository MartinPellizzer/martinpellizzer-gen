    "intro": "Carex curtiglumis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and arranged in a dense, cylindrical cluster. Its flowering stems produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Carex curtiglumis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
