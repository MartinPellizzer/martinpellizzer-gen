    "intro": "Cuscuta vulgaris, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize a wide range of host species. It is often found on crops like corn, beans, and sunflowers, causing economic damage in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unmanaged."
