    "intro": "[WRONG START] Coelogyne stipitibulbulbum, commonly known as the purple-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that often display a combination of purple and white hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are short and stout, supporting the plant's growth and storage of nutrients. The orchid's leaves are usually dark green and lance-shaped, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
