    "intro": "Campanula hirta, commonly known as the hairy bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically hairy, giving the plant its common name, and are arranged in a basal rosette or along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Campanula hirta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
