    "intro": "Calystegia sepium f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bindweed, is a variant of the common bindweed species. It is a climbing vine characterized by its slender, angular stems and heart-shaped leaves that are narrower than those of the typical form. The flowers are trumpet-shaped, with five petals, and typically range in color from white to pale pink. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, oblong seeds. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it can become invasive in certain regions."
