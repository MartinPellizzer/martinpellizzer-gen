    "intro": "Cleisocentron collettianum, commonly known as the giant panda orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive panda-like face on the lip, which is a unique feature among orchids. The plant typically grows in cool, shaded environments at high altitudes, often on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in its native habitat. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists."
