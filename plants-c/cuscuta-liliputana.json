    "intro": "Cuscuta liliputana, commonly known as the dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is native to parts of Asia and is often found growing on grasses and other small plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
