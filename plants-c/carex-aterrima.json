    "intro": "Carex aterrima, commonly known as black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many sedges. Carex aterrima thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
