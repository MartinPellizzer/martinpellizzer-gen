    "intro": "Cotoneaster wheeleri, commonly known as Wheeler's cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in spring, followed by bright red berries in late summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal."
