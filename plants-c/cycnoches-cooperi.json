    "intro": "Cycnoches cooperi, commonly known as the Cooper's cycnoches, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with each stem producing a new growth from a basal node. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, with intricate patterns that resemble the wings of certain insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cycnoches cooperi is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
