It features slender, woody stems that climb by means of small tendrils. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. This variety is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for alpine gardens."
