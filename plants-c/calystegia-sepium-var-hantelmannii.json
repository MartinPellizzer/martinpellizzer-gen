    "intro": "Calystegia sepium var. hantelmannii, commonly known as the Hantelmann's bindweed, is a variant of the common bindweed species. It is a herbaceous perennial vine characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, blooming in summer. It has a robust root system that allows it to spread aggressively, often making it a weed in agricultural and natural areas. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and challenging to manage."
