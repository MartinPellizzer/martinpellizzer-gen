    "intro": "Callilepis salicifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a medium-sized evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Callilepis salicifolia is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature."
