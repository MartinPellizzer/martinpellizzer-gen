It features striking, nodding, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces a single, lance-shaped leaf during its growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic alkaloids."
