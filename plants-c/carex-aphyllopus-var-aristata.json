    "intro": "Carex aphyllopus var. aristata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, with narrow, grass-green leaves that are typically shorter than the flowering stems. The plant produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
