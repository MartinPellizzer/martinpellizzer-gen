    "intro": "Carduus palousensis, commonly known as Palouse thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, purple-blue flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant has deeply lobed, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and along roadsides. Carduus palousensis plays a role in supporting pollinators and is considered a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
