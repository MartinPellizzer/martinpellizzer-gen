    "intro": "Columnea rubra, commonly known as the red flame plant, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub or trailing vine, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often glossy and dark green. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea rubra is popular in horticulture for its striking appearance and ease of care in suitable environments."
