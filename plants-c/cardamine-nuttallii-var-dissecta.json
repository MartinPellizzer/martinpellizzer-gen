    "intro": "Cardamine nuttallii var. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected watercress, is a delicate flowering plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in damp, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in stream banks and woodland areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-quality, undisturbed ecosystems."
