    "intro": "Centaurea indurata, commonly known as the hardy cornflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking blue to purple flower heads, which consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with lance-shaped, grey-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Centaurea indurata is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to treat skin conditions and as a diuretic."
