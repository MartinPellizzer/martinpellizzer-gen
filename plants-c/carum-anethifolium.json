    "intro": "Carum anethifolium, commonly known as wild chervil, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, aromatic leaves with a delicate anise-like fragrance. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family (Apiaceae). Its leaves are often used as a culinary herb, though it is less common than its cultivated relatives. Carum anethifolium thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
