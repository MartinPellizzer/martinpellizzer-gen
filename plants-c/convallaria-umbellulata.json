It features a rhizomatous root system and produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped white flowers in early summer. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves that form a dense rosette at the base. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is noted for its ornamental value in gardens."
