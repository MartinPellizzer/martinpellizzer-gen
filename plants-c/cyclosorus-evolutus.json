    "intro": "Cyclosorus evolutus, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a small, aquatic liverwort belonging to the family Peltogynandraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. This plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its structure consists of a thallus with leaf-like structures called phyllidia arranged in a spiral pattern. Cyclosorus evolutus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the biological diversity and providing habitat for microorganisms."
