    "intro": "Cassinia trinerva, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cassinia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands, often in regions with a Mediterranean climate. Its small, yellow flower heads are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Cassinia trinerva is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
