    "intro": "Clematis papillosa, commonly known as the silky clematis, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a vine or shrub, often climbing or trailing along supports. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Clematis papillosa prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental vines."
