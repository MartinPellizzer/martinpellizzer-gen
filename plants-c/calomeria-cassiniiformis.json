    "intro": "Calomeria cassiniiformis, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in dry, rocky soils. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Calomeria cassiniiformis is adapted to full sun and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
