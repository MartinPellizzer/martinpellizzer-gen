It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that are often fragrant. Its stems are covered in sharp, cylindrical spines, which provide protection from herbivores. Cereus venditus is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to thrive."
