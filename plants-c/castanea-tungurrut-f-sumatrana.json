    "intro": "Castanea tungurrut f. sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran chestnut, is a variant of the chestnut genus native to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by spiny, oval-shaped fruits containing one or two edible nuts. The nuts are encased in a thick, woody husk and are typically harvested when they turn brown and begin to fall from the tree. This species is valued for its hardy nature and potential use in both traditional medicine and as a food source."
