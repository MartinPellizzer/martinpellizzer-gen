    "intro": "Carduus atlantis, commonly known as the Atlantic thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It features spiny, lobed leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces purple to pink composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Carduus atlantis is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and preventing erosion."
