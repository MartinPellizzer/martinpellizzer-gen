    "intro": "Caltha palustris subvar. palmata, commonly known as the broadleaf marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features showy, yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has smooth, waxy leaves that are broadly ovate to heart-shaped, often with a distinctive white or pale border. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along stream banks. The subspecies palmata is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical variety of Caltha palustris."
