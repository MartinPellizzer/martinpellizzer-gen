    "intro": "Calyptrostylis, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Australia, particularly the Northern Territory and Queensland. Calyptrostylis species are characterized by their unique, hood-like structures that enclose the flowers, which are often brightly colored. They typically grow as terrestrial herbs or small shrubs, with slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. The genus includes several species, each with distinct floral morphology and habitat preferences."
