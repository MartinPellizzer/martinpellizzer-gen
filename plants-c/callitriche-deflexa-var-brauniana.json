    "intro": "Callitriche deflexa var. brauniana, commonly known as Braun's water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water, often in still or slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often prostrate or floating, with small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is distinguished by its compact growth habit and specific floral characteristics compared to other members of the Callitriche genus."
