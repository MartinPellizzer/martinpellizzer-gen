    "intro": "Carex vesicaria subsp. dichroa, commonly known as the two-colored sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, giving it its distinguishing appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, greenish-brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
