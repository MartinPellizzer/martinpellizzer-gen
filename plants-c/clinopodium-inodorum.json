    "intro": "Clinopodium inodorum, commonly known as sweet woodruff, is a perennial herb native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its fragrant, waxy leaves that emit a pleasant, hay-like aroma. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shaded environments. Clinopodium inodorum is often used in traditional herbal medicine and as a fragrant ornamental plant."
