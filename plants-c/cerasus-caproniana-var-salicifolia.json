It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and ovate, serrated leaves that are often tinged with red or purple in the fall. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for wildlife."
