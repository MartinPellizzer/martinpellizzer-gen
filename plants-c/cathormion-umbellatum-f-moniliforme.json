    "intro": "Cathormion umbellatum f. moniliforme, commonly known as the chain-fruit or necklace plant, is a unique variant of the native New Zealand plant Cathormion umbellatum. This form is characterized by its distinctive, bead-like fruits that are arranged in a chain-like pattern along the stem. The plant is a shrub with small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of New Zealand's rocky shores. The f. moniliforme form is particularly notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its unique fruiting structure."
