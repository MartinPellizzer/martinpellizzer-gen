    "intro": "Campyloneurum herbaceum, commonly known as the soft fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 30 cm in length. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of spongy tissue, which helps it absorb nutrients from the water. The plant plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments and supporting aquatic life."
