It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often woody and branched. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
