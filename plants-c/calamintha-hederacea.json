    "intro": "Calamintha hederacea, commonly known as creeping calamintha, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, aromatic stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Calamintha hederacea is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
