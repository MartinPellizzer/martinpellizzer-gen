    "intro": "Copiapoa coquimbana var. pseudocoquimbana, commonly known as the Coquimbo prickly pear, is a cactus native to the coastal regions of northern Chile. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has thick, spiny stems that store water, adapting to the arid environment. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. This variety is closely related to the parent species, Copiapoa coquimbana, but differs in size and floral characteristics."
