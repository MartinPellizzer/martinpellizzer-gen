    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 cambridgeanum, commonly known as the Cambridge lady's tresses, is a hybrid orchid resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium pubescens. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and long, spiral-shaped inflorescences that bear numerous pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is adapted to temperate climates. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display. Due to its rarity in the wild, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
