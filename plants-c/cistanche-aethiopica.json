    "intro": "Cistanche aethiopica, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic plant native to arid regions of Africa and Asia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on species of the genus Cistanche or other members of the Orobanchaceae family. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers and has a fibrous, branching structure that allows it to attach to its host. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported tonic and aphrodisiac properties. Cistanche aethiopica is adapted to survive in harsh environments through its ability to store water and nutrients efficiently."
