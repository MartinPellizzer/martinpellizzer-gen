    "intro": "Crepidiastrum denticulatum subsp. longiflorum, commonly known as the long-flowered milkweed, is a species native to parts of Central and South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The plant features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. Its milky sap, characteristic of the Apocynaceae family, contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores. The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting certain pollinators."
