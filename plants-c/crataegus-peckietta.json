    "intro": "Crataegus peckietta, commonly known as the Peck's hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pink flowers in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally considered unpalatable to humans. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins, and it typically grows in moist, woodlands or along stream banks. Crataegus peckietta plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
