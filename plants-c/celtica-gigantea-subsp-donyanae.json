    "intro": "Celtica gigantea subsp. donyanae, commonly known as the Donyana giant fern, is a strikingly tall fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-draining soil. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
