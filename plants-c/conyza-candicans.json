    "intro": "Conyza candicans, commonly known as the white dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Africa, South America, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and roadsides. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are small and yellow, forming a single bloom at the top of the stem. Conyza candicans is also known for its ability to produce a large number of seeds, which are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
