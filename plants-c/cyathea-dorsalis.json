    "intro": "Cyathea dorsalis, commonly known as the back-veined tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive dark green, fibrous trunk that is covered in a layer of dead fronds. Its fronds are bi-directionally pinnate, with prominent veins that give it its common name. Cyathea dorsalis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
