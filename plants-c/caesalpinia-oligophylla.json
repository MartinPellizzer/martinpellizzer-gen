    "intro": "Caesalpinia oligophylla, commonly known as the silky serissa, is a small shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, adding a striking visual appeal. Its fruit is a long, slender pod that splits open to release seeds. Caesalpinia oligophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
