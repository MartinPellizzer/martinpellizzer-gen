    "intro": "Carex dura, commonly known as rigid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes over 5,000 species of sedges, rushes, and marsh plants. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are stiff and grass-like, with a triangular cross-section, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes. Carex dura is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
