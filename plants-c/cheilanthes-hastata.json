    "intro": "Cheilanthes hastata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. Its fronds are typically short and upright, with sporangia clustered on the undersides of the leaves. Cheilanthes hastata is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in crevices, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils."
