    "intro": "Carex microsperma, commonly known as the small-seeded sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its seeds are minute and dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Carex microsperma plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
