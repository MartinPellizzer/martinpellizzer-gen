    "intro": "Cinnamomum pendulum, commonly known as the hanging cinnamon or weeping cinnamon, is a species of tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its drooping branches and slender, elongated leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by dark blue berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves and bark, are used in traditional medicine and aromatherapy. Cinnamomum pendulum thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
