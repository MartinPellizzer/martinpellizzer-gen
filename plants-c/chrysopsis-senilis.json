    "intro": "Chrysopsis senilis, commonly known as the silverleaf chrysopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy blooms. The plant features silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Chrysopsis senilis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
