    "intro": "Cactus retusus, commonly known as the hooked cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its stems are typically short and cylindrical, with prominent areoles from which both spines and flowers emerge. Cactus retusus is well adapted to desert conditions, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water."
