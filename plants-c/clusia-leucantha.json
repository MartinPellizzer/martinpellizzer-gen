    "intro": "Clusia leucantha, commonly known as the white-leaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically light green to white in color, which help reduce water loss in its native humid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded conditions and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage. Clusia leucantha is also valued for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and its resilience to drought."
