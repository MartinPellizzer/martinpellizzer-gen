    "intro": "Carex crinita var. mitchelliana, commonly known as Mitchell's hairgrass, is a perennial sedge native to North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically light to dark green, with a soft, feathery appearance. This plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer, adding subtle ornamental value. Its ability to tolerate water makes it a valuable plant for wetland restoration and natural landscaping."
