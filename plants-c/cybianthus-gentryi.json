    "intro": "Cybianthus gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's cybianthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive central disk surrounded by ray florets. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
