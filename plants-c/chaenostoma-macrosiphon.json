    "intro": "Chaenostoma macrosiphon, commonly known as the large-siphon water plant, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It features long, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with a distinct siphon-like structure at the base of each leaf. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom above the water, typically in summer. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for aquatic ecosystems and water quality monitoring."
