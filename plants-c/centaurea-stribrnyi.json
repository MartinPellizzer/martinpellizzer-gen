    "intro": "Centaurea stribrnyi, commonly known as the striped centaury, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers arranged in dense, conical clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat. Centaurea stribrnyi is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in temperate climates."
