It typically grows in mountainous regions and is characterized by its dense, spiny branches and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by dark, almost black berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
