    "intro": "Carduus \u00d7 umbrosus, commonly known as the shadow thistle, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Carduus nutans and Carduus marianus. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, purple to pinkish flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a rough, hairy texture, and the flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets. Carduus \u00d7 umbrosus is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to thrive in a variety of environments."
