    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna var. biserrata, commonly known as the hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white or pink flowers in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits called haws in the autumn, which are edible but often used in jams and wines. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along roadsides."
