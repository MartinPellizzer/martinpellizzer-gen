It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
