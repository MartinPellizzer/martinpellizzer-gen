    "intro": "Cryptanthus pseudoscaposus, commonly known as the Crimson Bells, is a striking member of the Amaranthaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of vibrant red or orange bracts that resemble small bells, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to the showy bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers bright, indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its compact growth habit and colorful foliage make it an excellent addition to gardens and containers."
