It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and along waterways, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, dry fruits.
