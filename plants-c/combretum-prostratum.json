    "intro": "Combretum prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate combretum, is a low-growing shrub native to tropical Africa. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers, which are often borne in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas."
