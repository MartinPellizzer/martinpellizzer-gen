It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, lanceolate leaves and showy, milky sap-filled stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is adapted to arid environments and often thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The milky latex it exudes is a notable botanical feature, contributing to its common name."
