    "intro": "Chamaerops nana, commonly known as the dwarf windmill palm, is a small, compact palm species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features a short, unbranched trunk with a crown of feathery, fan-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often used in rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by clusters of black, berry-like fruits. Chamaerops nana is a hardy, low-maintenance plant that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil."
