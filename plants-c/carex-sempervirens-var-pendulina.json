    "intro": "Carex sempervirens var. pendulina, commonly known as the hanging sedge, is a perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its drooping, grass-like foliage that forms dense clumps, creating a cascading effect. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens or bog gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and ability to provide texture and structure in wetland landscapes."
