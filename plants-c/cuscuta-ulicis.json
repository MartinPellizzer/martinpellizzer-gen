    "intro": "Cuscuta ulicis, commonly known as common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize a wide range of host species. It is often found on plants in the legume family, such as vetch and clover. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and natural vegetation."
