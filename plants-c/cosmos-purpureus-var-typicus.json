    "intro": "Cosmos purpureus var. typicus, commonly known as the Mexican whorled cosmos, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its bushy growth habit and showy, pink to purple flower heads that bloom from summer to fall. The plant features feathery, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single, whorled cluster at the end of each stem, creating a striking visual display. This species is well-suited for gardens and landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
