    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 tautzianum, commonly known as the Tautz hybrid\u6753\u5170, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium pubescens. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like structure, typically featuring a deep yellow or orange lip. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually broad and oval, and it produces a single or occasionally two flowers per stem. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
