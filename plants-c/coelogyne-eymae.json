    "intro": "Coelogyne eymae, commonly known as the Eyma's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically blooms during the summer months, with inflorescences bearing several flowers arranged in a raceme. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and covered in a layer of brownish bark, which helps in water retention. Coelogyne eymae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a tropical or subtropical climate."
