    "intro": "Castilleja muscipula var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It has bright orange-red bracts that resemble paintbrushes, which are used to attract pollinators. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures, relying on its host plants for nutrients. It typically grows in open, sunny areas such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its unique relationship with host plants and its striking floral display make it an important component of its ecosystem."
