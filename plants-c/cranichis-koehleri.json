    "intro": "Cranichis koehleri, commonly known as the Koehler's spider orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its unique, spider-like flower structure, which consists of a single, elongated spur. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its flowers, which are usually pale green or white, bloom during the spring and summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cranichis koehleri is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat destruction and climate change."
