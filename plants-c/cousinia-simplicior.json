    "intro": "Cousinia simplicior, commonly known as the simple cushionflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features silver-gray foliage with tightly packed, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Cousinia simplicior is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
