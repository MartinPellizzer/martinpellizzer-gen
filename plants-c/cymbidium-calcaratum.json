    "intro": "Cymbidium calcaratum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Cymbidium calcaratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
