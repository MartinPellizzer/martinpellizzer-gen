    "intro": "Carex rotundata, commonly known as the round-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Carex rotundata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
