    "intro": "Coburgia radula, commonly known as the coastal rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, succulent habit, which helps it survive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in response to seasonal rainfall. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white powder, which aids in reducing water loss. Coburgia radula is often found growing on rocky outcrops and sandy soils near the coast."
