    "intro": "Combretum viscidum, commonly known as the sticky combretum, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture, particularly on its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often visited by insects. Its leaves are typically ovate or elliptic, with a glossy surface and a serrated margin. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
