    "intro": "Claoxylon bakerianum, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, dark brown wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has a straight trunk with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a glossy green upper surface and a pale underside. Claoxylon bakerianum flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-yellow, and it produces woody fruits containing one or two seeds."
