    "intro": "Cedrus libanotica subsp. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved Lebanon cedar, is a subspecies of the cedar tree native to the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and short, dense foliage. The leaves are scale-like and tightly packed, giving the tree a distinctive appearance. It produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. This subspecies is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
