    "intro": "Calamus macrophyllus, commonly known as the broad-leafed calamus, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to Southeast Asia. It is a tall, slender grass-like plant that can grow up to several meters in height, characterized by its long, narrow leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, typical of many araceous species. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their aromatic properties and traditional medicinal uses. The plant thrives in wet, swampy habitats and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils."
