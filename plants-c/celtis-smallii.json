    "intro": "Celtis smallii, commonly known as the small's hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Elaeocarpaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by small, round berries that are edible for some bird species. Celtis smallii is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it a useful plant for xeriscaping and erosion control."
