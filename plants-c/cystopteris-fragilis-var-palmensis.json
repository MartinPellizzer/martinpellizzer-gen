    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis var. palmensis, commonly known as the palm fern, is a delicate fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a slender, upright rhizome with fronds that are pinnately divided and often have a pale, almost translucent appearance. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give the plant a feathery texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal or humid forest areas. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage."
