    "intro": "Cypripedium macranthos var. villosum, commonly known as the hairy large-flowered tuckahoe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pale yellow flowers with a prominent lip, and its hairy stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands, often in association with other orchid species. Its botanical features include a sympodial growth habit and a complex rhizome system. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
