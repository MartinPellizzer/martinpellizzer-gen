It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically blue or purple with five petals. The plant produces small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Clematis brasiliana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can climb support structures with its strong, twisting stems."
