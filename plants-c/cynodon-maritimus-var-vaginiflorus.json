    "intro": "Cynodon maritimus var. vaginiflorus, commonly known as the coastal grass or sea grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of sand. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its hardy nature, it plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion."
