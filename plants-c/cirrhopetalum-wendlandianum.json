    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum wendlandianum, commonly known as the Wendland's cirrhopetalum, is a rare and striking member of the Melastomataceae family. Native to the Andean regions of South America, it is characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to violet. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture. Its unique floral structure includes a long, slender spur that extends from the base of the petals, aiding in pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a plant of conservation concern."
