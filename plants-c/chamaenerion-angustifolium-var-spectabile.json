    "intro": "Chamaenerion angustifolium var. spectabile, commonly known as fireweed, is a flowering plant native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides, in wastelands, and in open fields. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. Fireweed is also known for its ability to colonize areas after wildfires, hence its common name."
