It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive foliage. The plant features upright, hairy stems and serrated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically blue to purple in color, forming a cluster of small florets at the top of the stem. Carlina intermedia is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
