    "intro": "Caperonia paludosa, commonly known as the marsh caper, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically features slender, erect stems that bear opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, often boggy soils. Caperonia paludosa plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
