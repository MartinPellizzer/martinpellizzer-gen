    "intro": "Cyperus rigidifolius var. intercedens, commonly known as the rigid-leaved flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often stiff and rigid, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-lobed spikelets, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. The plant is often found in disturbed wetlands and can serve as an indicator species for certain aquatic environments."
