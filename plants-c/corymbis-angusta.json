    "intro": "Corymbis angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf corymbia, is a species native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, arranged in compact clusters. Its bark is smooth and greyish in color, often exfoliating to reveal a reddish inner layer. Corymbis angusta is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
