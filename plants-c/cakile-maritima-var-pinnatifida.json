    "intro": "Cakile maritima var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the sea rocket, is a coastal plant adapted to sandy and saline environments. It possesses a rosette of pinnately lobed, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss and tolerate salt spray. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by small, triangular pods containing several seeds. It is often found in dunes and along shorelines, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
