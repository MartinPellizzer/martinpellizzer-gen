    "intro": "Cytinus hypocistis subsp. ochraceus, commonly known as the red-bellied broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of legumes. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its structure is simplified, with no true leaves, and it has a fleshy, swollen stem that serves as a storage organ. It is native to regions of the Mediterranean and is often found in dry, rocky soils."
