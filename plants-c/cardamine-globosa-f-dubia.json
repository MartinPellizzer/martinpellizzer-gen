    "intro": "Cardamine globosa f. dubia, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often yellow or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
