    "intro": "Chiropetalum gymnadenium, commonly known as the red sanders, is a rare and valuable tree native to the dry forests of southern India. It is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly sought after for its fine grain and durability. The plant has a slow growth rate and is known for its unique ability to produce a resinous sap that contributes to its high economic value. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a tropical to subtropical climate with seasonal rainfall. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as an endangered species."
