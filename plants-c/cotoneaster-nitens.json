It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine silvery or grayish pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes. Cotoneaster nitens is relatively low-maintenance and thrives in a variety of soil types, making it suitable for garden use."
