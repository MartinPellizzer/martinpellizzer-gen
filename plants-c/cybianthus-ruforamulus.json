    "intro": "Cybianthus ruforamulus, commonly known as the red-fruited broom. It is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers followed by distinctive red, fleshy fruits that persist through the winter. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
