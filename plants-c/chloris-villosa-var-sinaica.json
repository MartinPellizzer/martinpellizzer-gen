    "intro": "Chloris villosa var. sinaica, commonly known as the Sinai hair vetch, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish or yellowish flowers in panicle clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
