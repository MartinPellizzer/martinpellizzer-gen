    "intro": "Crepis spinosissima, commonly known as the spiny hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows and grassy areas. The plant has a creeping growth habit and produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is often considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting pollinators."
