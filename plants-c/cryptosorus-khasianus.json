    "intro": "Cryptosorus khasianus, commonly known as the Khasi cryptosorus, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in the understorey of tropical and subtropical forests. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Cryptosorus khasianus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
