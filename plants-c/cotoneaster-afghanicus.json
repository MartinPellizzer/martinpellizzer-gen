    "intro": "Cotoneaster afghanicus, commonly known as the Afghan cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and small mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
