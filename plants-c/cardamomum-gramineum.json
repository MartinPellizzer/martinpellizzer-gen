    "intro": "Cardamomum gramineum, commonly known as the grassy cardamom, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Zingiberaceae, which includes other aromatic plants like ginger and turmeric. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spikes, and its rhizomes are often used for their aromatic properties. Despite its name, it is not closely related to true cardamom but shares similar aromatic qualities."
