    "intro": "Cistanche tubulosa, commonly known as the Chinese parasitic desert vine, is a halophytic plant native to arid regions of Asia. It is a parasitic species that attaches to the roots of host plants, primarily those in the Fabaceae family. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, which is a unique adaptation to its harsh environment. Its stems are fleshy and succulent, allowing it to store water efficiently. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, and the plant is used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
