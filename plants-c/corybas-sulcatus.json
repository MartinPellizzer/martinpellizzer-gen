    "intro": "Corybas sulcatus, commonly known as the zigzag helleborine, is a species of orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, greenish-yellow flowers that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Corybas sulcatus is notable for its unique floral structure, which includes a spurred lip and a short, erect column."
