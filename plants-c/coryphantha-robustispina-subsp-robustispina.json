    "intro": "Coryphantha robustispina subsp. robustispina, commonly known as the robust spine cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in dense, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by the development of red, fleshy fruits. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. The subspecies is notable for its robust spines and compact growth habit, making it a distinctive feature in its native desert habitats."
