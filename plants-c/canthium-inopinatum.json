It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, typical of the genus Canthium. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
