    "intro": "Cirsium fraternum, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are covered in stiff, prickly hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The flowers are arranged in a composite head, consisting of both ray and disk florets, and bloom in late summer to early autumn."
