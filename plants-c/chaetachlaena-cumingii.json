    "intro": "Chaetachlaena cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that resemble those of a delicate grass. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and thrives in rich, well-drained soil. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
