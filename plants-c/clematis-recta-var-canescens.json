    "intro": "Clematis recta var. canescens, commonly known as the grayleaf Clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 15 feet, making it suitable for trellises or support structures. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a distinctive grayish-white underside that gives it its common name. This variety is relatively low-maintenance, preferring well-drained soil and full to partial sun."
