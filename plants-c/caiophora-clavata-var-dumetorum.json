    "intro": "Caiophora clavata var. dumetorum, commonly known as the dwarf caiophora, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features compact, rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep purple, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
