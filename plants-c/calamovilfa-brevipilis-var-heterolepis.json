    "intro": "Calamovilfa brevipilis var. heterolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often hidden among the foliage. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. This variety is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and ecological adaptability."
