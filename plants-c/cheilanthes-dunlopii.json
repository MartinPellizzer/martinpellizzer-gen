    "intro": "Cheilanthes dunlopii, commonly known as the Dunlop's rock fern, is a species of fern native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often growing on limestone or sandstone outcrops. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with fleshy, leathery fronds that help it retain moisture in its dry habitat. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns in the family Polypodiaceae. Cheilanthes dunlopii is well adapted to extreme environmental conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
