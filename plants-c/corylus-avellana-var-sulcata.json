    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. sulcata, commonly known as the European hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed leaves and clusters of yellowish-green catkins that appear in early spring. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiky husk, which ripen in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy ornamental and edible plant. Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a food source adds to its botanical significance."
