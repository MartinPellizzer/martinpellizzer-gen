    "intro": "Camptandra tahanensis, commonly known as the Tahan mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Camptandra tahanensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its high-altitude environment."
