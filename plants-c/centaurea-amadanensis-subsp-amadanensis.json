It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in arid environments. This subspecies is part of the genus Centaurea, which includes many species with similar thistle-like features."
