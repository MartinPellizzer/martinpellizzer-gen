    "intro": "Coleogeton filiformis subsp. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine filiform grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine ecosystems. Its growth habit is low and spreading, often forming dense mats on rocky slopes. Botanically, it is notable for its specialized morphology that aids in water retention and protection against strong winds."
