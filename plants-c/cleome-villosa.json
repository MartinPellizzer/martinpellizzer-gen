    "intro": "Cleome villosa, commonly known as the hairy cleome, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright stems covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are ovate to lance-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woods. Cleome villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
