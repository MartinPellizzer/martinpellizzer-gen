    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 conchiferum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium pubescens. It is a perennial herb with a distinctive, showy flower that resembles a slipper, typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and grows in cool, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it is valued for its ornamental beauty. Cypripedium \u00d7 conchiferum is also considered a rare and protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection."
