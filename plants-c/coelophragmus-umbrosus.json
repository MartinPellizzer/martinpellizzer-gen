    "intro": "Coelophragmus umbrosus, commonly known as the dark ghost cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus with dark green, ribbed stems that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle contrast to its dark foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
