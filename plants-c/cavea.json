    "intro": "Cavea, commonly known as the cave plant, is a unique species that thrives in rocky, shaded environments. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to arid conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are often pale green or white, blending with its surroundings. Its root system is shallow and spreads out to absorb moisture from the soil. Cavea is often found in limestone caves and crevices, making it a fascinating example of a plant that has evolved to survive in extreme habitats."
