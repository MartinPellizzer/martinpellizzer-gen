    "intro": "Campulosus planifolius, commonly known as the flat-leaf campulosus, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is native to arid and semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white, which bloom in the spring and summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss."
