    "intro": "Comesperma secundum subsp. oligotrichum, commonly known as the slender comesperma, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is typically found in heathlands and open woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
