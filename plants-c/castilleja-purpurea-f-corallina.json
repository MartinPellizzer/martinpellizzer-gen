    "intro": "Castilleja purpurea f. corallina, commonly known as the coral bract castilleja, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking, coral-pink bracts that resemble small flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its haustoria to extract nutrients from the roots of host plants. Its growth is often associated with specific host species such as grasses and forbs. This plant plays a role in local ecosystems by influencing nutrient cycling and providing habitat for certain insects."
