    "intro": "Convallaria mappii, commonly known as the Mapp's lily, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is a member of the Convallariaceae family, characterized by its evergreen rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers with a sweet fragrance, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are lanceolate and dark green, forming a dense, low-growing mat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
