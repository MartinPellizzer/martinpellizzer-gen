    "intro": "Caragana jubata, commonly known as the golden pea shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to Central Asia and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Caragana jubata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant suitable for dry landscapes. Its dense growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it valuable for soil stabilization and ecological restoration."
