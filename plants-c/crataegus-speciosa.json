    "intro": "Crataegus speciosa, commonly known as the showy crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its attractive, showy white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges and a rough texture. Crataegus speciosa thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks."
