    "intro": "Crotalaria leucotricha, commonly known as the white-haired crotalaria, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant is characterized by its distinctive white to yellow flowers and hairy stems, which give it its common name. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. Crotalaria leucotricha is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria."
