    "intro": "Cubanthus umbelliformis, commonly known as the Mexican bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the stems are often hairy as well. Cubanthus umbelliformis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
