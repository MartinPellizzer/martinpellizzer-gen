    "intro": "Clarkia speciosa subsp. nitens, commonly known as the showy clarkia, is a herbaceous annual plant native to western North America. It is characterized by its striking pink to red flowers, which are typically borne in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and along streambanks. The subspecies nitens is distinguished by its more elongated petals and slightly different growth habits compared to other subspecies of Clarkia speciosa."
