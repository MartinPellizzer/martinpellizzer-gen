    "intro": "Carex rhizopoda var. longior, commonly known as the long-leaved marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, three-lobed flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is distinguished by its longer leaves compared to the typical form of Carex rhizopoda."
