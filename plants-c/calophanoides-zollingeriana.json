    "intro": "Calophanoides zollingeriana, commonly known as Zollinger's calophanoides, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the humid forests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, clinging to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
