    "intro": "Caltha obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in wet or damp environments such as marshes, stream banks, and woodland areas. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a waxy coating, and the stems are often hairy. Caltha obtusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in wetland ecosystems."
