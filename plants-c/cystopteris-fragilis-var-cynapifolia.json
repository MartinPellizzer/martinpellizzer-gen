    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis var. cynapifolia, commonly known as the brittle fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically pinnately divided, with a soft, fragile texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along streams. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. This variant is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
