It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a robust root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Its foliage and flowers are often covered in fine hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance."
