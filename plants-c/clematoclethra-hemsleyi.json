    "intro": "Clematoclethra hemsleyi, commonly known as the Hemsley's clethra, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Clethraceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and its deciduous leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with a dense, compact form. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
