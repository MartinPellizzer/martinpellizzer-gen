    "intro": "Cornus kousa var. angustata, commonly known as the narrowleaf dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, ovate leaves that are typically 3 to 5 inches long and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red or orange berries in the fall. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage, floral display, and persistent fruit. It prefers partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
