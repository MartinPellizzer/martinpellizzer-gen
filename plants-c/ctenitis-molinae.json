It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves, a common feature in many fern species. Ctenitis molinae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
