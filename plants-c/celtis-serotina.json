    "intro": "Celtis serotina, commonly known as the lateleaf hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Elaeocarpaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, elliptical leaves that turn red in the fall. The tree produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by greenish-black berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a common sight in forest edges and woodland areas."
