    "intro": "Carex yukonensis, commonly known as Yukon sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America, particularly found in the Yukon and Alaska regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. Yukon sedge typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as bogs, marshes, and along stream edges. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are followed by three-sided, spike-like fruits. This plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
