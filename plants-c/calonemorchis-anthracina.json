    "intro": "Calonemorchis anthracina, commonly known as the red-stemmed orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its striking red stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers with a subtle fragrance. Native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable and often endangered species in its native range."
