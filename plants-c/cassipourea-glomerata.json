It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
