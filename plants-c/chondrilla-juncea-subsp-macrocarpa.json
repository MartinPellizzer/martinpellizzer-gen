It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in desert environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are usually narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in dry conditions. The subspecies is characterized by its relatively large, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds."
