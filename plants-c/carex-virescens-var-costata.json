    "intro": "Carex virescens var. costata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually green with a distinct white or pale midrib. Its flowering stems rise above the foliage, producing small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to greenish flowers. This variety is characterized by its distinctive leaf venation and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance."
