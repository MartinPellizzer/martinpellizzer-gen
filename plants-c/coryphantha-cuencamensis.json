    "intro": "Coryphantha cuencamensis, commonly known as the Cuencamensis Pincushion Cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its globular shape and dense clusters of small, tuberculate areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne in the axils of the spines. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated by cactus enthusiasts."
