    "intro": "Cactus subquadriflorus, commonly known as the four-flowered cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in spines and are adapted to store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a feature common in cacti that helps reduce water loss through transpiration. The four-flowered cactus is well-suited to harsh, dry environments and plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
