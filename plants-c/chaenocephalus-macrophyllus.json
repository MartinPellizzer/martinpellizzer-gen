    "intro": "Chaenocephalus macrophyllus, commonly known as the broad-leafed chaenocephalus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces yellow-orange composite flowers, which are composed of many small florets. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates."
