    "intro": "Cordyline \u00d7 rashleighana, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a hybrid plant that combines features of its parent species, Cordyline australis and Cordyline tomentosa. It is a tall, upright shrub or small tree with a fibrous, trunk-like stem covered in a layer of dead, papery leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright red, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are a distinctive feature. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Cordyline \u00d7 rashleighana is native to New Zealand and is often cultivated for its striking appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions."
