    "intro": "Carex atropicta var. monodynama, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial sedge native to wetland and bog environments in Europe. It features dark purple to blackish stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by dark, berry-like seed capsules. It thrives in acidic, waterlogged soils and is often found in peat bogs and marshes. This variety is notable for its striking coloration and ecological importance in supporting wetland biodiversity."
