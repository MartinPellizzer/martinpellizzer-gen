    "intro": "Cyperus triceps var. multiflorus, commonly known as the three-branched flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, making it common in marshy areas and along waterways. Its flowers are usually greenish or brownish, and it produces small, three-angled fruits. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
