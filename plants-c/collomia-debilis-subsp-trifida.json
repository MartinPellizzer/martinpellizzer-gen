    "intro": "Collomia debilis subsp. trifida, commonly known as the three-flowered collomia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers. The plant typically produces three to five flowers per inflorescence, which is a distinguishing feature of this subspecies. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall rugged appearance."
