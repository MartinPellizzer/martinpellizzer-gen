    "intro": "Croton punctatus, commonly known as the spotted croton, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that often feature distinctive spots or streaks of yellow, red, or orange. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
