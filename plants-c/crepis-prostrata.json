    "intro": "Crepis prostrata, commonly known as prostrate sowthistle, is a low-growing annual or biennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically has a prostrate or decumbent growth habit, with slender, hairy stems that lie close to the ground. The plant features small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in a single, elongated inflorescence. Its leaves are usually alternate, with a rough texture and often lobed or toothed margins. Crepis prostrata is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
