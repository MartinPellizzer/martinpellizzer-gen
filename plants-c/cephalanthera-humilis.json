    "intro": "Cephalanthera humilis, commonly known as the Lesser Butterfly Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a small, herbaceous plant with delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a short rhizome and produces a single, spurred flower per stem, which is characteristic of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Cephalanthera humilis is pollinated primarily by flies and lacks true roots, relying instead on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption."
