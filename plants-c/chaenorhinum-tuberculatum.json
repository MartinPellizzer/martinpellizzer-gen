    "intro": "Chaenorhinum tuberculatum, commonly known as the wrinkled horned poppy, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, tuberculate (knobbed) stems and bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, while its seed pods are elongated and split open when mature. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
