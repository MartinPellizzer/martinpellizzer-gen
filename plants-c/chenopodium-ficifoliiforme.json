    "intro": "Chenopodium ficifoliiforme, commonly known as the Indian gooseberry or amla, is a deciduous shrub native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and often resemble the leaves of the fig tree, hence its specific epithet. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into bright red, fleshy berries. These berries are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional medicine for their antioxidant properties. Chenopodium ficifoliiforme thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks."
