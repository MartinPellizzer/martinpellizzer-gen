    "intro": "Chrysosplenium davidianum var. alpinum, commonly known as Alpine goldcup, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of East Asia. It features rosettes of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain heat in cold climates. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in cup-like inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant for rock gardens and alpine collections."
