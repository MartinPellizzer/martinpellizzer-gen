    "intro": "Celastrus albatus, commonly known as the white bittersweet, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptic leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, followed by orange-red berries that persist into winter. Its stems are woody and can become quite vigorous, often climbing trees or shrubs. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
