    "intro": "Conchidium sinicum, commonly known as the Chinese horned vetch, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility. However, it is considered invasive in some regions, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
