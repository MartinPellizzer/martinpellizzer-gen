    "intro": "Carex banksii var. odontolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern North America. It typically grows in wet to mesic habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has grass-like leaves that are narrow and often have a distinct midrib, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually green or brown in color. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes many other sedges and related plants. This variety is distinguished by its narrow, pointed leaves and its preference for moist environments."
