It consists of about 150 species, primarily found in Africa, South America, and parts of Asia. Cotula plants are typically small herbs with daisy-like flowers, often featuring yellow or white petals and a central disk. They are characterized by their delicate foliage and are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Many species are cultivated as ornamental plants due to their attractive blooms and easy care requirements."
