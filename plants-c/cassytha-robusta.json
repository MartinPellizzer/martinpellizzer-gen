    "intro": "Cassytha robusta, commonly known as the swamp clematis, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has slender, wiry stems that twine around other plants, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in axillary sprays. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a slightly hairy texture. Cassytha robusta is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments."
