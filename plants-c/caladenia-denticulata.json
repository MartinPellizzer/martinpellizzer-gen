It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, intricate flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, usually between June and September. The orchid's unique morphology and habitat make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of its native ecosystem."
