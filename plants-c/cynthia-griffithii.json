    "intro": "Cynthia griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's cynthia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can thrive. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a glossy surface that reflects light, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cynthia griffithii is considered a species of conservation concern."
