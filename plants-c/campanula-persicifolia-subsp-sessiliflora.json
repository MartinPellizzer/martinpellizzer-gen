    "intro": "Campanula persicifolia subsp. sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk, and are often lance-shaped or ovate. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a versatile addition to rock gardens and borders."
