    "intro": "Cinchona rubicunda, commonly known as the red cinchona, is a species of tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking red flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant is known for its medicinal properties, particularly in the production of quinine, which has historically been used to treat malaria. It thrives in high-altitude tropical forests and requires a humid climate with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
