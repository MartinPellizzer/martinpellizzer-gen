    "intro": "Cyperus rubriglumosus, commonly known as the red-fruited flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flowers. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Cyperus rubriglumosus typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its seeds are dispersed by water, contributing to its ability to thrive in moist environments."
