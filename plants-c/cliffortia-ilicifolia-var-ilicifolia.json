    "intro": "Cliffortia ilicifolia var. ilicifolia, commonly known as the silver leafed bush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with a silvery-blue hue due to the presence of fine hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or slopes. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
