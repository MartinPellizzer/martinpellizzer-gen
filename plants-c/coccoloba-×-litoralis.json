    "intro": "Coccoloba \u00d7 litoralis, commonly known as the beach hibiscus, is a hybrid plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant has showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic inundation, making it a valuable plant for coastal restoration projects."
