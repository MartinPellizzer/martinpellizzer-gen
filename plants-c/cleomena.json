    "intro": "Cleomena, commonly known as the spring beauty, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and appear before the flowers, giving it its common name. Cleomena is often found in the eastern and central United States, where it plays a role in early pollination by bees and other insects."
