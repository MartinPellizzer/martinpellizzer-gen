    "intro": "Crassula ovata, commonly known as the Jade Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a compact, bushy appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Due to its low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
