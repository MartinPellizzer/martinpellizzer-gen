    "intro": "Coccothrinax crinita, commonly known as the curly tree or the palm of the Caribbean, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish flowers, which are followed by small, round fruits. Its adaptability to coastal environments makes it a common sight in tropical regions, often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The plant's resilience to salt spray and wind makes it well-suited for coastal and dune habitats."
