    "intro": "Cyperus sesquiflorus f. spinulosus, commonly known as the spinulose flatsedge, is a variant of the flatsedge plant characterized by its distinctive, spinose (spiny) bracts. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions, typically found in wetland or marshy habitats. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower spikes that are often subtended by the spiny bracts. Its botanical features make it easily identifiable within the Cyperaceae family. The spinulose form is notable for its unique morphology, which sets it apart from other varieties of Cyperus."
