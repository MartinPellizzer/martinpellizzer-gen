    "intro": "Cassia mimosoides var. lateriticola, commonly known as the lateritic cassia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are often mistaken for those of the mimosa plant. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open when mature. This species is adapted to grow in lateritic soils, which are rich in iron and aluminum oxides, making it a resilient plant in nutrient-poor environments."
