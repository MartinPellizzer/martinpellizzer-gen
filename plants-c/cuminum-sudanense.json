    "intro": "Cuminum sudanense, commonly known as Sudan cumin, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Sahel region of Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are used as a spice, similar to regular cumin but with a distinct, more pungent flavor. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates and is often cultivated for both its culinary and medicinal properties. The botanical features of Cuminum sudanense make it well adapted to harsh environments, contributing to its resilience and widespread use in traditional medicine."
