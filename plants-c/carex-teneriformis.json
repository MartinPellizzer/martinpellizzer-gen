    "intro": "Carex teneriformis, commonly known as the soft form sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Native to parts of Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or wetlands. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly curled, giving it a delicate appearance. Carex teneriformis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
