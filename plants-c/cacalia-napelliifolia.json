    "intro": "Cacalia napelliifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features slender, hairy stems that often branch near the base, supporting clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale blue, bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
