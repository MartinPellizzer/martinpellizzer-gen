    "intro": "Callicarpa hypoleucophylla, commonly known as the white-leaf beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy clusters of violet-blue berries that appear in late summer. The plant's leaves are distinctive for their pale, almost white underside, which contrasts with the deep green upper surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Callicarpa hypoleucophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
