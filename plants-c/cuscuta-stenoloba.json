    "intro": "Cuscuta stenoloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant is native to regions in North America and is often found parasitizing various species of grasses and forbs. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a potential weed in agricultural settings. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological interactions by affecting the growth of its host plants."
