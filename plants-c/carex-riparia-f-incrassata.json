    "intro": "Carex riparia f. incrassata, commonly known as the broadleaf sedgeland sedge, is a variant of the common sedgeland sedge. It is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its leaves are broad and flat, with a rough texture, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually wind-pollinated. This form is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Carex riparia."
