    "intro": "Carex thibetica var. thibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to high-altitude regions of Asia, including parts of China, India, and Nepal, where it thrives in moist, rocky soils. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It is often found in alpine meadows and stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
