    "intro": "Cousinia sardashtensis, commonly known as the Sardasht cushion plant, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Iran. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, arid environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flower heads that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss and aiding in thermal regulation. Cousinia sardashtensis is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
