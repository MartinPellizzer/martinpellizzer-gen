    "intro": "Carex thecata, commonly known as narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Native to North America, it thrives in moist to wet environments such as marshes and wetlands. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
