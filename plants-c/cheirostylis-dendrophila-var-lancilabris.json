    "intro": "Cheirostylis dendrophila var. lancilabris, commonly known as the lance-shaped orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, relying on its host for support rather than soil. The plant features slender, lanceolate leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. It is characterized by its elongated labellum, which is a distinguishing feature of the species. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive species with limited distribution."
