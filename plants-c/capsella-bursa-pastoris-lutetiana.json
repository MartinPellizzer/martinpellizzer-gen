    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris lutetiana, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white flowers and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, round seed pods that resemble a shepherd's purse, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an invasive species in many regions."
