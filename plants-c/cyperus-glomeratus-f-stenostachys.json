It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered spikelets. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as along the edges of ponds or in swamps. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinct midrib, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
