    "intro": "Colysis bolsteri, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue or white flowers. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry environment. It typically grows from a short, woody stem and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Colysis bolsteri is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, high-sunlight conditions."
