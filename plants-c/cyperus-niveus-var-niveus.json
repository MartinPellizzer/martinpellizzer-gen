It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically white or pale green in color, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens or used in ecological restoration projects."
