    "intro": "Carex digitata var. hungarica, commonly known as the Hungarian finger grass, is a perennial sedge native to Central and Eastern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a distinctive, finger-like arrangement of the inflorescence. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are wind-pollinated, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity."
