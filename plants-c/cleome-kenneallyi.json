    "intro": "Cleome kenneallyi, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a striking annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and clusters of small, often pink or white, tubular flowers. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Cleome kenneallyi is noted for its unique, ghostly appearance, especially when viewed in the early morning light."
