    "intro": "Crotalaria aridicola, commonly known as the desert crownflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, which bloom during the cooler months. It has small, ovate leaves with a hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Crotalaria aridicola is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland desert environments."
