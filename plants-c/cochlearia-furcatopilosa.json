    "intro": "Cochlearia furcatopilosa, commonly known as the forked-hair rock-cress, is a flowering plant species native to the rocky coastal areas of southern Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a raceme. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh maritime conditions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
