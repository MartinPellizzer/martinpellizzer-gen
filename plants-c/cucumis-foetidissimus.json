    "intro": "Cucumis foetidissimus, commonly known as the stink cucumber, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, vining plant that produces small, green fruits with a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant has hairy, ribbed stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are yellow and typically appear in clusters, and the fruit is generally about 5\u201310 centimeters in length. Despite its foul smell, it is sometimes cultivated for its unique characteristics and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples."
