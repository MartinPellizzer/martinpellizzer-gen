    "intro": "Combretum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and clusters of small, pale yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a leathery texture with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils."
