    "intro": "Camonea, commonly known as the \"Cape rose\" or \"Cape jasmine,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and includes several species that are often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The plants are shrubs or small trees, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Camonea species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their beauty. They play an important ecological role in their native habitats by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various wildlife."
