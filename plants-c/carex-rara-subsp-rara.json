    "intro": "Carex rara subsp. rara, commonly known as the rare sedge, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils, typically found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds and streams. It is a perennial plant that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense clumps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Carex rara subsp. rara is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
