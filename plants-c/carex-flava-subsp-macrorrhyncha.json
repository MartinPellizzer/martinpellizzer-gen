    "intro": "Carex flava subsp. macrorrhyncha, commonly known as the broad-leaf sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and specialized reproductive structures. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of pale yellow to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. The leaves are linear, stiff, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in its wetland habitat."
