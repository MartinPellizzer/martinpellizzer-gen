    "intro": "Cannaboides andohahelensis, commonly known as the Andohahelensis hemp plant, is a rare and unique species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Cannabaceae family, which includes other hemp and cannabis-related plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. It contains low levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) but higher concentrations of cannabidiol (CBD), making it of interest for medicinal research. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
