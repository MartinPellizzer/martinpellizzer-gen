    "intro": "Chilianthus lobulatus, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive globular shape, with dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Chilianthus lobulatus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
