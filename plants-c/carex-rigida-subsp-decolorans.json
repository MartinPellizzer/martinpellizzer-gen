It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically pale green to reddish in color, especially during the growing season. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting wetland biodiversity."
