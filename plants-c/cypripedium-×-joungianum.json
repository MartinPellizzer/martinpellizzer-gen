    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 joungianum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and endangered species resulting from the crossbreeding of Cypripedium moranum and Cypripedium calceolus. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, typically pink or white in color. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of eastern China and is adapted to cool, moist, and shaded habitats. Its growth is slow, and it produces a single, large flower per stem, making it a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is highly threatened in the wild."
