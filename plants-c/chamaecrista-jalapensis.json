    "intro": "Chamaecrista jalapensis, commonly known as the Mexican burr legume, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, spiny pods that contain seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
