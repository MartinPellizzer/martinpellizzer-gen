    "intro": "Cladium effusum, commonly known as the soft rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its cylindrical, leafless stems that are often covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and thrives in marshy or waterlogged soils. Its flowering spikes are usually greenish or reddish and appear at the top of the stems. Cladium effusum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
