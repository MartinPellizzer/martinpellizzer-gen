    "intro": "Cymbopogon scabrimarginatus, commonly known as the rough-edged citron grass, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with rough, serrated margins. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in spike-like clusters, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its aromatic properties, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
