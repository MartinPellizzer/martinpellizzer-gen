    "intro": "Cydista, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Araceae. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizomes and distinctive, arrow-shaped leaves that are often dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers surrounded by a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. Cydista is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
