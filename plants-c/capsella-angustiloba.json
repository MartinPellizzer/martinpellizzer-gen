    "intro": "Capsella angustiloba, commonly known as narrowleaf common groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is an annual herb that typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 centimeters, featuring slender stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the ends of the stems, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal. Capsella angustiloba is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
