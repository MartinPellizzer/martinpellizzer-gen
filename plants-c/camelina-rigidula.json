    "intro": "Camelina rigidula, commonly known as rigid bladderwrath, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Camelina rigidula is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient conditions."
