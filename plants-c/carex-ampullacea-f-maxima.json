    "intro": "Carex ampullacea f. maxima, commonly known as the giant bulbous sedge, is a striking ornamental plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage and distinctive bulbous rhizomes that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is a popular choice for water gardens and bog gardens."
