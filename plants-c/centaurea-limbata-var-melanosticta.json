    "intro": "Centaurea limbata var. melanosticta, commonly known as the black-stained star-thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, glandular leaves and bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it has a deep taproot system that allows it to thrive in arid conditions. Due to its invasive potential in some areas, it is sometimes considered a noxious weed."
