    "intro": "Ceroxylon interruptum, commonly known as the Andean wax palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that give it its common name and its ability to thrive in high-altitude environments. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its trunk is typically unbranched and covered in a thick, fibrous layer. Ceroxylon interruptum is also noted for its ecological importance in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
