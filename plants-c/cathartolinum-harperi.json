    "intro": "Cathartolinum harperi, commonly known as the Harperi's cathartolinum, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of vibrant yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sunlight to flourish. Its unique morphology includes modified leaves that function as spines, reducing water loss in arid environments. Due to habitat loss, Cathartolinum harperi is considered endangered and is protected in several national parks."
