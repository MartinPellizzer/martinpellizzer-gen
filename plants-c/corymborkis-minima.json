    "intro": "Corymborkis minima, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and undergrowth. The plant features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Its flowering period usually occurs during the rainy season, and it is often found in association with other epiphytic orchids. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
