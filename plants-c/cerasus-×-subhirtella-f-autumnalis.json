    "intro": "Cerasus \u00d7 subhirtella f. autumnalis, commonly known as the autumnal cherry or autumnalis cherry, is a botanical hybrid belonging to the Prunus genus. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which turns vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, tart berries. It is typically cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than for fruit production. This variety thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth."
