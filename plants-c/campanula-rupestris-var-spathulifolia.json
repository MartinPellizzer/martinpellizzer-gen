    "intro": "Campanula rupestris var. spathulifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and limestone habitats in southern Europe. It features compact growth with hairy stems and produces clusters of bell-shaped blue to violet flowers. The leaves are broad and oval, often with a waxy coating, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
