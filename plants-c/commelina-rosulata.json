    "intro": "Commelina rosulata, commonly known as the rosette morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate blue or purple flowers with a distinctive white spot at the base. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies. Commelina rosulata is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
