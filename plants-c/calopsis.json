    "intro": "Calopsis, commonly known as the \"blue-eyed grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Iridaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their delicate, grass-like foliage and showy, often blue or violet-colored flowers. Calopsis species typically grow in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. They produce small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens."
