    "intro": "Carex limosa f. longivaginata, commonly known as the long sheath sedge, is a variant of the common sedge, characterized by its elongated, grass-like leaves. It is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family, typically found in wet or moist environments such as marshes and along stream banks. The plant produces spikelets that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, with male and female flowers often occurring on separate spikes. Its botanical features include fibrous roots, narrow linear leaves, and a robust rhizomatous growth habit, which aids in its survival in waterlogged soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
