    "intro": "Copiapoa humilis subsp. australis, commonly known as the Huacachina cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is well adapted to extreme drought, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
