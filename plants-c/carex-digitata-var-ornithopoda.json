    "intro": "Carex digitata var. ornithopoda, commonly known as the ornate sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy, with a distinct midrib. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are arranged in a cylindrical shape. The ornate sedge is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
