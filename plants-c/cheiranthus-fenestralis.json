It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops and weeds. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are linear and often have a distinctive fenestration, or window-like openings, giving it its common name. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
