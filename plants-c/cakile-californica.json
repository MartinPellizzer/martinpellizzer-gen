    "intro": "Cakile californica, commonly known as the California rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other well-known plants such as mustard and cabbage. This perennial plant typically grows in rocky soils and coastal areas, exhibiting a low, spreading growth habit. Its small, white or yellow flowers appear in early spring, and it produces small, rounded seed pods that split open to release its seeds. The plant is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in coastal bluffs and dry, sunny habitats."
