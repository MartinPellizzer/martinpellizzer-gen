    "intro": "Cyperus teneristolon var. robustior, commonly known as the broadleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, thriving in shallow water or saturated soil. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-sided spikelets, which are often green or brown in color. Cyperus teneristolon var. robustior is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
