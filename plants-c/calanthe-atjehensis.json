    "intro": "Calanthe atjehensis, commonly known as the Aceh calanthe, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Aceh region of Indonesia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status remains uncertain."
