    "intro": "Cochemiea senilis, commonly known as the silver hair cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Sonoran Desert in the United States and Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish-blue spines that give it a silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in a low, rounded form, with multiple stems that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, blooming in late spring or early summer. Cochemiea senilis is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
