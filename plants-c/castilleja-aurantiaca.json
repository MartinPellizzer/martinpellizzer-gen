    "intro": "Castilleja aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a slender, branching stem and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Castilleja aurantiaca forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil."
