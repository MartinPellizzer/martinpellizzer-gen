    "intro": "Caltha palustris var. arctica, commonly known as the Arctic marsh marigold, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It features bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in wet meadows, tundra, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The species is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season, making it a hardy plant in harsh environments."
