    "intro": "Cynodon hirsutus var. sesquiflorus, commonly known as the hairy carpet grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to blue flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, lawns, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
