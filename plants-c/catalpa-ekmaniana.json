It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The tree produces long, bean-like pods that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, temperate climates. Catalpa ekmaniana is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical significance in Chinese horticulture."
