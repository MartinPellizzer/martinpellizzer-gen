    "intro": "Callipteris attenuata, commonly known as the narrowleaf holly fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help it spread and establish in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, delicate pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often found in forest understories where it contributes to the biodiversity of the ecosystem."
