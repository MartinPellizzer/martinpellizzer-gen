    "intro": "Chamaecereus stilowianus, commonly known as the Stilowianus cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless plant with a distinctive cylindrical shape and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It has a shallow root system and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
