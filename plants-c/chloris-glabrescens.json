    "intro": "Chloris glabrescens, commonly known as slender grass or slender bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to white flowers, which appear in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Chloris glabrescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native garden settings."
