    "intro": "Ctenitis tindalii, commonly known as the Tindal's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizome system supports its growth, allowing it to form dense clumps over time. The fronds are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions, adding to its unique botanical appeal."
