    "intro": "Claytonia depressa var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved spring beauty, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features rosettes of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, showy white or pink flowers in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for studying plant adaptation to forest ecosystems."
