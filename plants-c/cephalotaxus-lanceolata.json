    "intro": "Cephalotaxus lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf yew, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain bird species. Its cones are woody and contain seeds that are dispersed by animals. Cephalotaxus lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its dense, compact form."
