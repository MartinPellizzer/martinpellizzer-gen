    "intro": "Cakile constricta, commonly known as narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other well-known plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. It has small, alternate leaves and produces yellow flowers in early spring. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently."
