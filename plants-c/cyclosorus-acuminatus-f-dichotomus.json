    "intro": "Cyclosorus acuminatus f. dichotomus, commonly known as the dichotomous cyclosorus, is a variant of the cyclosorus genus, characterized by its distinct branching pattern. It is a small, aquatic fern that typically grows in freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. The fronds are delicate and finely divided, with a feathery appearance that enhances its ornamental value. This fern is notable for its unique dichotomous branching, where the stems split into two equal parts at each node. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
