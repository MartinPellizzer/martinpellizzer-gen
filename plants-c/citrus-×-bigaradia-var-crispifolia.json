    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 bigaradia var. crispifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf mandarin, is a hybrid citrus plant characterized by its distinctive, waxy leaves with a rough, serrated texture. The leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery feel, which helps the plant retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into citrus fruits with a thin, peely skin and a juicy, sweet-tart pulp. It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruit. This variety is particularly valued for its resilience and adaptability to different environmental conditions."
