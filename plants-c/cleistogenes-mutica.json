    "intro": "Cleistogenes mutica, commonly known as the silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the United States, particularly in the central and eastern regions. It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs that cover its leaves and stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny blue to purple flowers. Cleistogenes mutica is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
