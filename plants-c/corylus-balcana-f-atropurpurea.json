    "intro": "Corylus balcana f. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple-husk hazel, is a variant of the hazelnut plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive purple-tinged husks that encase the nuts, which are typically smaller than those of the standard species. The plant produces catkins in early spring, followed by the development of the edible nuts in late summer. Its leaves are usually oval with a serrated edge and a dark green upper surface. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often grown in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
