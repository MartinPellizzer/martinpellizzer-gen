It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cynorkis souegesii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
