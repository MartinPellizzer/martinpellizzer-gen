It is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure and vibrant coloration, which includes a mix of green, yellow, and red hues. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, often in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in a rosette formation. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
