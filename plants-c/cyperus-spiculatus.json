    "intro": "Cyperus spiculatus, commonly known as spike rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, cylindrical leaves and clusters of small, spike-like flower heads. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. Cyperus spiculatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and support biodiversity."
