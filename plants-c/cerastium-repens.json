    "intro": "Cerastium repens, commonly known as white sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, white flowers. The plant has hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, and it produces capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along the edges of water bodies. Cerastium repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
