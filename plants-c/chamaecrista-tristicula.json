    "intro": "Chamaecrista tristicula, commonly known as the yellow burr legume, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils, often found in coastal areas and dunes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by distinctive, spiny pods that contain the seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are narrow and lance-shaped. Chamaecrista tristicula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
