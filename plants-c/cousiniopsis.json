    "intro": "Cousiniopsis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Cousiniopsis is native to regions of the Americas and is often found in wetlands and disturbed soils. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
