    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 olneyi, commonly known as the Olney sedge, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Carex genus in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms. Carex \u00d7 olneyi is often found in the eastern United States and is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
