    "intro": "Cupressus lusitanica subsp. kuluensis, commonly known as the Kulu cypress, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It is a small evergreen conifer characterized by its narrow, pyramid-shaped crown and scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous forest ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
