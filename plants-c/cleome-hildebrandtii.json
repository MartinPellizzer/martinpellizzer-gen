It is characterized by its distinctive, spindly stems and clusters of small, spider-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cleome hildebrandtii thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant ornamental plants. Its unique appearance and ease of cultivation have led to its use in both wild and cultivated settings."
