It produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, blooming in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and bears fruit that splits open to reveal bright red seeds. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the unique climate of the Gal\u00e1pagos. Its presence is an important indicator of the ecological balance in its native habitat."
