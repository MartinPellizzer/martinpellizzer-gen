    "intro": "Crataegus betulifolia florida, commonly known as the Florida hawthorn, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive leaves, which are elongated and resemble those of birch trees. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. The Florida hawthorn is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
