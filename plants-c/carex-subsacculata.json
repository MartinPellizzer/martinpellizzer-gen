It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly curved, with a dense cluster of spikelets at the top. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in a cylindrical inflorescence, and it produces small, three-angled berries.
