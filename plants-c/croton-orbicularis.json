    "intro": "Croton orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular croton, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, orbicular-shaped leaves that come in a variety of vibrant colors, including red, yellow, and green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
