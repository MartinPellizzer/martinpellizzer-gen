    "intro": "Cymbidium lowianum var. kalawense, commonly known as the Kalawense Cymbidium, is a tropical orchid native to the Philippines. It features tall, slender pseudobulbs that support long, arching inflorescences with clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces showy, lance-shaped petals and sepals, with a prominent, spurred lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
