It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. The plant features a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens. The varietal name *adenopodus* refers to the glandular structures on its stems, which contribute to its ecological adaptations."
