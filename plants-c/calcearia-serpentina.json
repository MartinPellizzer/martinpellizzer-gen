    "intro": "Calcearia serpentina, commonly known as the snake's head flower, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiral-shaped inflorescence that resembles a snake's head. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers that are clustered in a helical pattern along a central stem. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and hairy, contributing to its rugged appearance. Calcearia serpentina thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
