    "intro": "Cornopteris atroviridis, commonly known as the black-veined wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The leaves are pinnately compound, with dark green, serrated leaflets and prominent, contrasting veins. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in the wild."
