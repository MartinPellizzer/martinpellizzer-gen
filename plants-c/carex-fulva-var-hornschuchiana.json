    "intro": "Carex fulva var. hornschuchiana, commonly known as the yellow sedge, is a perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces bright yellow flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a pale yellowish-green color that gives the plant its common name."
