    "intro": "Cheirolophus intybaceus, commonly known as the yellow bell heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
