    "intro": "Claytonia brevipedata, commonly known as the dwarf spring beauty, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features rosettes of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which bloom on slender stalks above the foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and early blooming period, it is a popular plant among wildflower enthusiasts and gardeners."
