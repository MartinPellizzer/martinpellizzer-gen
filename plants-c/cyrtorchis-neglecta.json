    "intro": "Cyrtorchis neglecta, commonly known as the neglected orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. The plant has a slender, erect stem with a few leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. Cyrtorchis neglecta is relatively rare and often overlooked due to its modest appearance."
