    "intro": "Carlina lecoqii, commonly known as the Lecoq's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny bracts. The plant has basal rosettes of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into hard, spiny fruits. Carlina lecoqii is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates."
