    "intro": "Chamaecrista pedicellaris var. adenosperma, commonly known as the glandular crownflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or subshrub with woody stems and small, compound leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in dry conditions. The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
