    "intro": "Coleosanthus glomeratus, commonly known as the clustered sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has spiny, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found near the shoreline. Coleosanthus glomeratus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
