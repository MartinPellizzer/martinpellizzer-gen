    "intro": "Celastrus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered staff-vine, is a deciduous climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, elliptic leaves that are usually smooth and dark green on top. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright orange berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its stems are woody and can twine around supports, making it a common sight in woodland and wetland habitats. Celastrus parviflorus is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental berries and ecological role."
