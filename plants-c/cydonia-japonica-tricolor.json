    "intro": "Cydonia japonica tricolor, commonly known as the Japanese persimmon, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are alternate and have a distinctive three-leaf structure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by three-lobed fruits that change color from green to yellow or orange as they ripen. The fruit is edible, sweet, and often used in traditional Asian cuisine. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
