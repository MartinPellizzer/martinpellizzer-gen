    "intro": "Coniogeton, commonly known as the grass bur or sand bur, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, spike-like inflorescences and are often found in sandy or disturbed soils. The seeds of Coniogeton are encased in hard, spiny burs, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. They are native to various regions across Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Due to their aggressive growth, some species are considered invasive in certain areas."
