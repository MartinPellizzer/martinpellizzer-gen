It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that often have a bluish or purplish hue. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or violet in color, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for erosion control."
