    "intro": "Corothamnus rectipilosus, commonly known as the slender goatweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically herbaceous growth habit. The plant features narrow, hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Corothamnus rectipilosus is often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in full sun and displaying adaptive traits suited to its native habitat."
