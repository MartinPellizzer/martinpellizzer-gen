    "intro": "Carduus carolinianus, commonly known as the Carolina thistle, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 2 meters tall, covered with coarse, spiny hairs. The plant produces pink to purple flowers with yellow centers, which bloom from late spring to early fall. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with a rough texture and a strong, bitter taste. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
