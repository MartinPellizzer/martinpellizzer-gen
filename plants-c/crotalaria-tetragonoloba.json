    "intro": "Crotalaria tetragonoloba, commonly known as horse bean or stink bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its quadrangular stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces elongated, ridged pods containing seeds that are often used as forage for livestock. It has a deep root system that helps in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil fertility. However, it contains toxic alkaloids, which can be harmful to animals if ingested in large quantities."
