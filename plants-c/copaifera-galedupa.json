    "intro": "Copaifera galedupa, commonly known as the Brazilian copaiba, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Clusiaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, resinous sap, which has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties. The plant typically grows in humid lowland forests and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles. The tree is valued not only for its resin but also for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitat."
