It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that are typically twisted or curled, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This subspecies is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats, contributing to local biodiversity."
