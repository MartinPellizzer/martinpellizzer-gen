    "intro": "Cardamine hunanensis, commonly known as the Hunan water crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
