It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, clustered inflorescences. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with ants, which inhabit the hollow stems and protect the tree from herbivores. Its bark is smooth and often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. Cecropia argentea plays an important role in tropical ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various species."
