It features a thick, cylindrical stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant has spiny, modified leaves that reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Its flowering occurs during the rainy season, producing small, yellowish flowers. Caroxylon namaqualandicum plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing shelter and food for local wildlife."
