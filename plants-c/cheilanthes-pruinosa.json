    "intro": "Cheilanthes pruinosa, commonly known as the pruinose rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and grayish-white, waxy coating on its fronds, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves, typically arranged in a single row along the veins. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found on cliffs or in crevices, where it can access limited moisture. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
