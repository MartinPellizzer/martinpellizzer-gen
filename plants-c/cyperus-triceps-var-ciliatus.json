It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its flowering spikes are usually small and clustered, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The hairy texture of its leaves and stems is a distinguishing feature of this variety."
