    "intro": "Cerastium caespitosum var. montevidense, commonly known as the Montevidense mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to South America. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its compact form and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shady borders."
