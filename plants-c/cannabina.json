    "intro": "Cannabina, commonly known as cannabis, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cannabaceae family. It is native to Central Asia and has been cultivated for thousands of years for its fibers, seeds, and psychoactive properties. The plant contains compounds called cannabinoids, with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) being the most well-known. Cannabina typically grows as an annual herb with tall, slender stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers, which are the main source of cannabinoids, are often harvested for medicinal and recreational use."
