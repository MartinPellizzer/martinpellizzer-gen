It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and elongated, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and distinctive, woody fruits containing a single, hard seed. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of a unique, oily substance in its seeds, which has historically been used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests."
