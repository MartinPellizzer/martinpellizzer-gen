    "intro": "Crotalaria brownei, commonly known as the Brown's crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with prominent spurred petals. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and has palmately lobed leaves. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds through mechanical means. Crotalaria brownei is also noted for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
