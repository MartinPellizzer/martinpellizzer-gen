    "intro": "Corytoplectus riceanus, commonly known as the ricean sea snail, is a species of sea snail in the family Turbinidae. It is characterized by its small to medium size and a spiral, calcareous shell that is typically smooth and glossy. The shell is often adorned with fine, concentric ridges and a distinct aperture. This species is typically found in shallow marine environments, such as rocky shores and tidal zones. Its diet primarily consists of algae and detritus, which it scrapes from surfaces using its radula."
