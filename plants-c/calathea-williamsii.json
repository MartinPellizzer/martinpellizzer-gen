    "intro": "Calathea williamsii, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that often feature intricate patterns and a deep green coloration. The plant's leaves fold upwards at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty, which is a unique adaptation to its natural environment. Calathea williamsii thrives in humid, shaded conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
