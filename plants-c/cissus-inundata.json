    "intro": "Cissus inundata, commonly known as the water fig or aquatic cissus, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant thrives in moist environments, such as marshes and swamps, and has adapted to aquatic conditions with specialized root systems. Its stems are flexible and can root at nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly in wet habitats. The flowers are small and greenish-white, typically appearing in clusters, and it produces small, edible berries."
