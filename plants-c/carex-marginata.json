    "intro": "Carex marginata, commonly known as the silver edge sedge, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves that have a distinctive silvery margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp environments. Carex marginata is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
