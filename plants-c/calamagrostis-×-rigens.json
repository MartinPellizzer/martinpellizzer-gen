It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking silver-gray foliage that turns coppery in the fall. The plant produces feathery panicles of small, blue-green flowers in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Calamagrostis \u00d7 rigens is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
