    "intro": "Cirsium arvense var. spinosissimum, commonly known as the spiked field thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, leafy stems and large, showy purple to blue flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a robust root system and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges and covered in fine hairs. This variety is distinguished by its particularly long and sharp spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
