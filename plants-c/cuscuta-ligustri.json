    "intro": "Cuscuta ligustri, commonly known as dodder of the elm, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is often found on elms, hawthorns, and other woody species. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means. Cuscuta ligustri is considered a weed in agricultural and forest settings due to its ability to weaken host plants."
