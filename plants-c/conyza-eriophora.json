    "intro": "Conyza eriophora, commonly known as the smallflower ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an annual herb characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Conyza eriophora plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
