It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Carex petriei is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
