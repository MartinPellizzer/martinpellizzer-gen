    "intro": "Carex condensata var. flava, commonly known as the yellow sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bright yellow to golden green in color. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered spikes of inconspicuous flowers, which are followed by three-sided, boat-shaped berries. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in wetland environments."
