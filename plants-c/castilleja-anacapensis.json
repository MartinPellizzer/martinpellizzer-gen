    "intro": "Castilleja anacapensis, commonly known as the Anacapa milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the coastal areas of Southern California and the Channel Islands. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Castilleja anacapensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
