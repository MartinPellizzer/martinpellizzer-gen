    "intro": "Calyptranthera, commonly known as the orchid bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in countries like Brazil and Mexico. Calyptranthera species are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and orange. The plants typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, meaning they can be found growing on trees or rocks in humid environments. Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral structures and their role in local ecosystems."
