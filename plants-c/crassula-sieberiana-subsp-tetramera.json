    "intro": "Crassula sieberiana subsp. tetramera, commonly known as the four-leaf crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a slight red or purple tinge under stress. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Its slow growth rate makes it an ideal choice for rock gardens or as a potted plant."
