    "intro": "Circaea latifolia, commonly known as white-berried sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands, stream banks, and rocky areas. Circaea latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
