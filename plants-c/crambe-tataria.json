    "intro": "Crambe tataria, commonly known as Tatarian hogweed, is a flowering plant native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial that grows up to 2 meters tall, featuring large, umbrella-shaped inflorescences. The plant has smooth, hairy, or glandular stems and leaves with a distinctive, often strongly aromatic scent. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. The plant is known for its potential toxicity, particularly due to the presence of furanocoumarins in its sap."
