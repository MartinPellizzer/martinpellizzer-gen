    "intro": "Cordia passa, commonly known as the Brazilian mahogany or red cedar, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange to red, fleshy fruits containing several seeds. Cordia passa is valued for its durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss."
