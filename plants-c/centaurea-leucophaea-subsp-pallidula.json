It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and the plant typically grows in dry, open habitats. It produces achene fruits with bristles, which aid in wind dispersal. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
