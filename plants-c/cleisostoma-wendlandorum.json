    "intro": "Cleisostoma wendlandorum, commonly known as the Wendland's cleisostoma, is a rare and exotic orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and reducing water loss. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cleisostoma wendlandorum is considered a delicate and endangered species in its natural range."
