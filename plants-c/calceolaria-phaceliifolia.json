It is native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina, and is known for its striking, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that resemble small cups. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are often violet or purple, with a distinctive hooded structure that protects the reproductive organs. Calceolaria phaceliifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cool, humid climates."
