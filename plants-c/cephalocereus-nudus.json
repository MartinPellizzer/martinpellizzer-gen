    "intro": "Cephalocereus nudus, commonly known as the naked cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, segmented stems that are covered in small, spineless areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its adaptations to arid environments include a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss and the ability to store water in its succulent stems. Cephalocereus nudus is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun conditions."
