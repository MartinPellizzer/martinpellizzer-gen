    "intro": "Campanula microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are evergreen in mild climates. Campanula microcarpa prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and it is known for its hardiness and ease of cultivation."
