    "intro": "Cactus carneus, commonly known as the naked cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are often covered in sparse, short spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warm season, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to extreme drought conditions. The plant's unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in both botanical studies and horticultural cultivation."
