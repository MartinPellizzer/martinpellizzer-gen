    "intro": "Cactus hystrix, commonly known as the hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the deserts of Mexico and the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its root system is shallow and widespread, enabling it to quickly absorb rainwater. The cactus also plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing shelter and food for various desert animals."
