    "intro": "Croton chrysocladus, commonly known as the golden-leaved croton, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, glossy yellow leaves that contrast beautifully with its dark green stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, spiny capsules that contain its seeds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in outdoor gardens in suitable climates."
