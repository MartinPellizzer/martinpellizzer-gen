    "intro": "Carex pachinensis, commonly known as the broad-leaved sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant features grass-like leaves that are typically broad and flat, with a dense, cylindrical inflorescence that bears small, spike-like flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common component of wetland ecosystems. Carex pachinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
