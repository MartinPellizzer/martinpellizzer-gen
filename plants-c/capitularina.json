It is characterized by its composite flower heads, which consist of numerous small florets arranged in a dense cluster. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is native to regions of Europe and Asia. Its leaves are usually alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Capitularina produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fluffy, seed-filled capsules, aiding in wind dispersal."
