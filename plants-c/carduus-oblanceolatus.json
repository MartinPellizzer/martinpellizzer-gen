    "intro": "Carduus oblanceolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust root system and upright, spiny stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall. The plant produces pale yellow flowers arranged in a compact, spherical head, which bloom from late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with rough, hairy surfaces and sharp margins, contributing to its defensive characteristics. Carduus oblanceolatus is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry meadows, where it thrives in full sun."
