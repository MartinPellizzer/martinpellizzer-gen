    "intro": "Choristosoria, commonly known as the \"spore-bearing liverworts,\" are a group of non-vascular plants belonging to the order Marchantiales. They are characterized by their thalloid structure, which is a flat, leaf-like body that lacks true leaves, stems, or roots. These plants reproduce via spores, which are produced in specialized structures called sporangia located on the thallus. Choristosoria typically thrive in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Their simple morphology and ancient lineage make them important subjects for studying the early evolution of land plants."
