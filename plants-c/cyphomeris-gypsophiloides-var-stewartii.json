    "intro": "Cyphomeris gypsophiloides var. stewartii, commonly known as Stewart's gypsophiloides, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
