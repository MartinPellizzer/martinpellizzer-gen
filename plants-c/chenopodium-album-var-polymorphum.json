    "intro": "Chenopodium album var. polymorphum, commonly known as red root sandparsley, is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and alternate, pinnately lobed leaves that are often reddish or purple-tinged. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, and its seeds are covered in a fine, powdery coating. It is typically found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often considered a weed. This variant is distinguished from other Chenopodium species by its variable leaf shape and coloration."
