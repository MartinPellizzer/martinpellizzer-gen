    "intro": "Cerastium heterotrichum, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes other flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the leaves. Its leaves are typically hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks."
