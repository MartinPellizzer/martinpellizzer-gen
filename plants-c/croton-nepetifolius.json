It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that resemble the paw of a cat, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The leaves are also used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties."
