    "intro": "Coccoloba taylorii, commonly known as the Taylor's pride of Barbados, is a flowering plant species native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
