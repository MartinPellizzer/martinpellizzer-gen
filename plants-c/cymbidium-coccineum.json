    "intro": "Cymbidium coccineum, commonly known as the red orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns and a strong, sweet fragrance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often arranged in a fan shape, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Cymbidium coccineum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is cultivated for both its beauty and its ability to thrive in a variety of growing conditions."
