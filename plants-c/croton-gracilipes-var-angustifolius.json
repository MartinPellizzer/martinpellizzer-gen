It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its growth habit is often shrub-like, with a branching structure that can reach up to several meters in height. The leaves and stems contain milky sap, which is a common feature among members of the Euphorbiaceae family."
