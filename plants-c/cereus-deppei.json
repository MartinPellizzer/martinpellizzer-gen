    "intro": "Cereus deppei, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is typically found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers are short-lived, usually lasting only a single night, and it is known for its slow growth rate. Cereus deppei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique flowering display."
