    "intro": "Croton atrostellatus, commonly known as the black star croton, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves with a distinctive black midrib and veins, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in outdoor gardens in suitable climates."
