    "intro": "Connarus poilanei, commonly known as the Madagascar ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant exhibits a tall, straight trunk with a broad, spreading crown, and its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture. Connarus poilanei produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round berries. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in its native range."
