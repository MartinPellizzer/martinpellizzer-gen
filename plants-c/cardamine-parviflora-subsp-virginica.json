    "intro": "Cardamine parviflora subsp. virginica, commonly known as the Virginia watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features small, alternate leaves that are usually heart-shaped or ovate, with a distinctive waxy coating. Its flowers are white or pale green, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
