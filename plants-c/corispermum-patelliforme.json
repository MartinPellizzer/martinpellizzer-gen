    "intro": "Corispermum patelliforme, commonly known as the flat-leafed sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, fleshy, orbicular leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in small, capsule-like fruits and are adapted for dispersal by wind. Corispermum patelliforme is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
