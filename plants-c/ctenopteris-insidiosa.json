    "intro": "Ctenopteris insidiosa, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent in the dark, which helps in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
