    "intro": "Cyclophyllum guillauminianum, commonly known as the Guillauminian cyclophyllum, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers, gourds, and other vine-like plants. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, spirally coiled stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically yellow or green, and it produces small, round fruits that are not commonly consumed by humans. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
