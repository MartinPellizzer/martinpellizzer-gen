    "intro": "Clidemia velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by small, round berries. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
