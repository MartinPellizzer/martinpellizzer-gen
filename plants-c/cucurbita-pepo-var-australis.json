    "intro": "Cucurbita pepo var. australis, commonly known as the Australian pumpkin, is a variant of the common gourd species. It is characterized by its robust, often ribbed, and elongated fruit that can vary in color from green to orange or yellow. This plant typically grows as a trailing or climbing vine, with palmately lobed leaves and yellow flowers. It thrives in warm climates and is cultivated for both ornamental and edible purposes. The fruit is generally less sweet than other Cucurbita species but is valued for its hard rind and starchy flesh."
