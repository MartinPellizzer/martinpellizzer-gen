    "intro": "Caladeniastrum flavum, commonly known as the golden spider orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, showy flower with a distinctive yellow and brown coloration. The orchid's intricate floral structure includes a narrow, tubular labellum that mimics the appearance of a spider, aiding in pollination by specific insects. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in open habitats, preferring full sun. Due to its beauty and rarity, it is often protected in its natural environment."
