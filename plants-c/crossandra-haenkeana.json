    "intro": "Crossandra haenkeana, commonly known as the flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Crossandra haenkeana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
