    "intro": "Cucurbitella, commonly known as the \"bitter cucumber,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cucurbitaceae. These plants are characterized by their trailing or climbing growth habit, with hairy stems and lobed leaves. The flowers are typically unisexual, with separate male and female blooms, and the fruits are usually elongated and spiny. The genus includes several species that are cultivated for their edible fruits, although some are toxic and should be handled with care. Botanically, Cucurbitella is closely related to other cucurbit plants such as cucumbers and melons."
