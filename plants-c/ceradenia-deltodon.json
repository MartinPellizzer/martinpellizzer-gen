    "intro": "Ceradenia deltodon, commonly known as the Deltodon orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, intricate flower structure with a distinctive, elongated spur. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually a mix of white and green hues, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ceradenia deltodon is considered a conservation concern."
