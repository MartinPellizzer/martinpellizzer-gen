    "intro": "Ctenodon warmingii, commonly known as the slender-stemmed ctenodon, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it attaches itself to trees or rocks rather than growing in soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ctenodon warmingii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
