    "intro": "Coprosma epiphytica, commonly known as the climbing coprosma, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and bright green, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by dark blue berries. It is typically found growing on trees and shrubs in moist, shaded environments. Coprosma epiphytica is well adapted to epiphytic life, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic."
