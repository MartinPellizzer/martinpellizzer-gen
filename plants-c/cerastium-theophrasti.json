It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, rounded leaves that are often mistaken for mouse ears, giving it its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and gardens. Botanically, it belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and stellate (star-shaped) hairs on its stems and leaves."
