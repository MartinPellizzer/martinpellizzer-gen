    "intro": "Cyclobothra plummerae, commonly known as the slender cycad, is a species of cycad native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Cyclobothra plummerae is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
