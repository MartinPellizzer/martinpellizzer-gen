    "intro": "Campanula celtidifolia, commonly known as the Scottish bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the British Isles and parts of northern Europe. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland margins and rocky habitats. Campanula celtidifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
