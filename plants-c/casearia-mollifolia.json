    "intro": "Casearia mollifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silky casearia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in disturbed habitats. The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and challenging to control in agricultural settings."
