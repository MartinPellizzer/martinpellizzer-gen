It is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America, characterized by its opposite, oval leaves and showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. Cornus striata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks.
