    "intro": "Cornopteris birii, commonly known as the Bornean water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in ornamental water gardens. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are typically divided into small, serrated segments, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Cornopteris birii plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
