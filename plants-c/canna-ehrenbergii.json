    "intro": "Canna ehrenbergii, commonly known as the giant cannas, is a striking ornamental plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 feet in length and its showy, tropical-looking flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in warm, humid climates and requires full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps, making it an excellent choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions. Canna ehrenbergii is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
