    "intro": "Ctenitis zayuensis, commonly known as the Yunnan tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its upright growth habit. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
