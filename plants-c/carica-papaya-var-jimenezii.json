It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and yellow-orange fruits that are typically smaller than the common papaya. The plant produces a distinctive latex sap, which is a feature shared with other members of the Caricaceae family. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is often cultivated for its unique flavor and nutritional value."
