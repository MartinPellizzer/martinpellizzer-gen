    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna subsp. latiloba, commonly known as the large-fruited hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and showy pink or white flowers that appear in spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its larger, more fleshy fruits compared to other hawthorn species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along roadsides. This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for birds and insects."
