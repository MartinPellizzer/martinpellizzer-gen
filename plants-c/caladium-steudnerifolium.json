    "intro": "Caladium steudnerifolium, commonly known as the red-veined caladium, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with deep red veins contrasting against bright green or white backgrounds. The plant belongs to the Araceae family and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant. Its foliage is the primary feature, as it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
