    "intro": "Cistus atlanticus f. guttatus, commonly known as the Atlantic rockrose, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of western Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it withstand salty sea air and coastal conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in the spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and cliff faces. This variety is notable for its resilience and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
