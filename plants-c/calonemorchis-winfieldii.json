    "intro": "Calonemorchis winfieldii, commonly known as the Winfield's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. The plant produces delicate, pale green to white flowers with a unique, ghost-like appearance, which contributes to its common name. Its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption in poor soils, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for survival. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
