    "intro": "Coptosapelta lutescens, commonly known as the yellow sandalwood, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a small, evergreen tree characterized by its smooth, pale yellow bark and lanceolate, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by small, woody fruits containing minute seeds. Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, it is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
