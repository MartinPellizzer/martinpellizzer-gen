    "intro": "Cephalophyllum dubium, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and unique plant belonging to the Onagraceae family. It is characterized by its striking, lantern-like flowers that resemble small, glowing orbs, which appear in late summer. Native to the mountainous regions of Mexico, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a specific microclimate to flourish. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, with a subtle iridescent sheen that enhances their ethereal appearance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Cephalophyllum dubium is considered a delicate and endangered species."
