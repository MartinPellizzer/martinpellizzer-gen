    "intro": "Calamagrostis nemoralis, commonly known as the wood reed, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its flowering stems produce panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Calamagrostis nemoralis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect life."
