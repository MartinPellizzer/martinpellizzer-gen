    "intro": "Calanthe pullei, commonly known as the golden calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features a compact, rhizomatous growth habit with showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with a deep yellow lip. The plant produces a single, upright spike bearing several blooms, each with intricate petal patterns. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and arranged in a rosette at the base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calanthe pullei is considered a conservation concern."
