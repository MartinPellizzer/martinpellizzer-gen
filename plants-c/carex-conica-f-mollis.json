    "intro": "Carex conica f. mollis, commonly known as the soft-tipped bulblet sedge, is a flowering plant in the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, grassy leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshes, bogs, or along the edges of ponds. Its soft, velvety texture and unique morphology make it a distinctive addition to wetland ecosystems."
