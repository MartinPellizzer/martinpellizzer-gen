    "intro": "Chenopodium opulaceum, commonly known as rough goosefoot, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and clusters of small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Chenopodium opulaceum is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
