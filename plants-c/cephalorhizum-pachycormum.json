    "intro": "Cephalorhizum pachycormum, commonly known as the broad-cormed headroot, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its thick, swollen corms that store nutrients for survival in harsh mountain environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and adapted to retain moisture, while its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize the soil in rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
