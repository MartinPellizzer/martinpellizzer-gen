    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 kimballianum, commonly known as the Kimball's\u6753\u5170, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, showy, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive, pouch-like lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it receives indirect sunlight. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clumps over time. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
