It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it forms dense stands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
