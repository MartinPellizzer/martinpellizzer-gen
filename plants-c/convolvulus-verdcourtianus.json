It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces tendrils that help it climb and support its growth on other plants or structures.

It is often found in disturbed soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid regions."
