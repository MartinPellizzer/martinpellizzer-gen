    "intro": "Cereus northumberlandianus, commonly known as the Northumberland cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a trait typical of many desert cacti. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique flowering habit."
