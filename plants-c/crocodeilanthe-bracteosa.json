It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, organic soil to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
