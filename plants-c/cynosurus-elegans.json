    "intro": "Cynosurus elegans, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological systems and a subject of study in plant morphology."
