    "intro": "Cyclosorus dentatus, commonly known as the toothed water shield, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater wetlands in North America. It has narrow, floating leaves with a distinctive serrated or toothed margin, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged or floating, contributing to its ecological role in water ecosystems. Its roots help stabilize sediment, and it provides habitat for various aquatic organisms. Cyclosorus dentatus is often found in still or slow-moving water, such as ponds and marshes."
