    "intro": "Calystegia macrostegia subsp. amplissima, commonly known as the broad-stemmed bindweed, is a flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The flowers are typically white or pale purple, with five petals and a distinctive tubular throat. This subspecies is native to parts of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in waste areas. It produces fruiting capsules that release small, dry seeds, facilitating its spread in various habitats."
