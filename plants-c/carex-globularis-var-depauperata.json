    "intro": "Carex globularis var. depauperata, commonly known as the sparse globular sedge, is a compact, clump-forming plant native to wetland environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of inconspicuous flowers in the spring, which are followed by three-sided, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its low maintenance and ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, it is a popular choice for wetland restoration projects."
