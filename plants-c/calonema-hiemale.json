    "intro": "Calonema hiemale, commonly known as the winter calonema, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit with lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to white in color, blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Calonema hiemale is considered a delicate and challenging species to cultivate."
