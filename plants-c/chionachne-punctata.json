    "intro": "Chionachne punctata, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and small, narrow leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme cold and strong winds. Chionachne punctata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic and alpine flora and fauna."
