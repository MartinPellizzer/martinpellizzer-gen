    "intro": "Chamissoa dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched chamissoa, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and cliffs, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Chamissoa dichotoma is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
