    "intro": "Cyathea hebes, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in the understory. Its rhizome system allows it to anchor itself in soil while absorbing nutrients efficiently. Cyathea hebes is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
