    "intro": "Cylindrokelupha alternifoliolata, commonly known as the spiral-leaf cycad, is a unique cycad species characterized by its distinctive foliage. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately compound, with a spiral arrangement that sets it apart from other cycad species. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
