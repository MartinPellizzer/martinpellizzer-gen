    "intro": "Colchicum autumnale f. patens, commonly known as the autumn crocus or meadow saffron, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Colchicaceae and is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features a bulb-like corm, which stores nutrients and allows it to survive in harsh conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and emerge after the flowers, often in a different season. This variant of Colchicum autumnale is notable for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
