    "intro": "Cyclosorus riparius, commonly known as the river fern, is a small aquatic fern native to freshwater environments in North America. It thrives in slow-moving streams and rivers, often growing in moist, shaded areas along the banks. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize streambeds and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Cyclosorus riparius plays a vital role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments and absorbing nutrients."
