These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue. The leaves are typically trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Cyrtospermum species often grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodland areas. They are valued for their ornamental beauty and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their striking floral displays."
