    "intro": "Calophyllum rigidum, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. The species is also important in ecological systems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
