    "intro": "Capparis glauca var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sea blush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late winter to early spring. The plant has woody stems and succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize coastal dunes, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
