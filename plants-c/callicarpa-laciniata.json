It is characterized by its showy, clustered purple berries that appear in the fall, attracting birds and other wildlife. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant. The berries are not only visually striking but also contain high levels of anthocyanins, which give them their vibrant color."
