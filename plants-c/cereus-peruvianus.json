    "intro": "Cereus peruvianus, commonly known as the Peruvian torch cactus, is a species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its straight, spiny stems and clusters of white, night-blooming flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening only at night and closing by dawn. Cereus peruvianus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique flowering habits."
