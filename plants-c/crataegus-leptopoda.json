    "intro": "Crataegus leptopoda, commonly known as the slender hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally not consumed by humans. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and it typically grows in moist, woodland areas. Crataegus leptopoda is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
