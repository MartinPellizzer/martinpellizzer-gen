    "intro": "Cardamine flaccida subsp. alsophila, commonly known as the Alsophila watercress, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically reaches a height of about 10\u201320 cm. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in moist environments. It thrives in shaded, damp habitats such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its small, white or greenish flowers are borne in clusters and are often overlooked due to their modest appearance."
