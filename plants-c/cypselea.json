    "intro": "Cypselea, commonly known as the bladder campion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. They typically have succulent, fleshy leaves and stems, which help them retain water in arid environments. Cypselea species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens."
