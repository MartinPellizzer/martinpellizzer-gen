    "intro": "Celtis australis, commonly known as the European hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It belongs to the Cannabaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval, dark green leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, smooth fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Celtis australis is often used in urban landscaping due to its tolerance of pollution and compact size. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
