    "intro": "Cynodon notatus, commonly known as the grassland couchgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are clustered along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Cynodon notatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
