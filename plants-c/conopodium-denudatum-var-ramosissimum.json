    "intro": "Conopodium denudatum var. ramosissimum, commonly known as the slender false hellebore, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features slender, upright stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in forest understories and along streambanks."
