    "intro": "Chaetostoma tetrastichum var. crassipes, commonly known as the broad-leaved water lettuce, is a variant of the water lettuce species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. The plant has a spongy, air-filled stem that allows it to float on the water's surface. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with each leaf being oval and slightly undulating. This variant is often found in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats, where it can form dense mats on the water surface."
