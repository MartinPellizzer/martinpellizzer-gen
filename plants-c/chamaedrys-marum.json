    "intro": "Chamaedrys marum, commonly known as the creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It features small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, spherical blue berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Chamaedrys marum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
