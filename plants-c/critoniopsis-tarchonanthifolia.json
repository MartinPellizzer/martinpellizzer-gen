    "intro": "Critoniopsis tarchonanthifolia, commonly known as the tarchonanthifoliate critoniopsis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often blooming during the warmer months. Its botanical features include a hairy stem and ovate leaves with a rough texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
