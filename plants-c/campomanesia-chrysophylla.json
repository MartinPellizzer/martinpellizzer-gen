    "intro": "Campomanesia chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden-leaved campomanesia, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, golden-yellow leaves that provide striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers followed by edible, orange-red berries. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its unique coloration. The tree thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
