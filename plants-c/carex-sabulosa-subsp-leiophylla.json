    "intro": "Carex sabulosa subsp. leiophylla, commonly known as the smooth-leaved sand sedge, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, with narrow, flat leaves that are typically smooth and leathery in texture. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments or along shorelines. This subspecies is valued for its ability to stabilize sand dunes and its ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
