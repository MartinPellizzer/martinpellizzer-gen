    "intro": "Cyclosorus parasiticus subsp. manickirudorum, commonly known as the Indian parasitic liverwort, is a unique liverwort species that exhibits a parasitic lifestyle. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its host for nutrients. This subspecies is typically found growing on the roots of certain trees, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Its morphology is characterized by a flattened, ribbon-like thallus with a distinct, lobed structure. The plant plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its habitat by influencing soil chemistry and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
