    "intro": "Carex erinacea, commonly known as silky sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms compact clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Silky sedge thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks."
