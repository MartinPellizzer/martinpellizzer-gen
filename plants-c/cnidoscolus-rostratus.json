    "intro": "Cnidoscolus rostratus, commonly known as the spiny nightshade, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. It contains toxic compounds, including bufotenin, which makes it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Due to its defensive spines and toxic properties, it is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges."
