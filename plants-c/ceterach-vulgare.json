    "intro": "Ceterach vulgare, commonly known as sea holly, is a coastal plant native to the British Isles and other parts of Europe. It is a perennial species that thrives in sandy or shingle beaches, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue or purple flowers in early summer. Its root system helps stabilize coastal soils, making it an important part of coastal ecosystems. Ceterach vulgare is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
