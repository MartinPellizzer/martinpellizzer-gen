    "intro": "Castanea phansipanensis, commonly known as the Phansipan chestnut, is a rare and endemic species native to Vietnam. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and other chestnut species. The plant is characterized by its deciduous nature, producing oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its fruit is a spiny bur, containing one or two edible nuts enclosed in a thick husk. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
