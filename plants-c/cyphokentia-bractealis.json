    "intro": "Cyphokentia bractealis, commonly known as the bractean palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by ornamental, boat-shaped fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties. Due to its slow growth and specific care requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
