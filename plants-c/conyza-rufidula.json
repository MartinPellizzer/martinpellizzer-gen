    "intro": "Conyza rufidula, commonly known as roughleaf weed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, often hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in clusters, while the leaves are usually rough and pubescent. Conyza rufidula is considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
