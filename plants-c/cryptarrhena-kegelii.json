    "intro": "Cryptarrhena kegelii, commonly known as the Kegel's cryptarrhena, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems, which are typical of many species in the Rubiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and relatively understudied species."
