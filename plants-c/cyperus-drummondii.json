    "intro": "Cyperus drummondii, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedgeland, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats, thriving in poorly drained soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Cyperus drummondii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
