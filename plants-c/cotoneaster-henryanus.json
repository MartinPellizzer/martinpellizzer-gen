    "intro": "Cotoneaster henryanus, commonly known as the Henryan's cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring dense, rounded foliage composed of small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. Cotoneaster henryanus is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil in rocky or arid environments."
