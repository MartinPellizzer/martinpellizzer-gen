It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found on coastal cliffs and slopes. Cliffortia triloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
