    "intro": "Cnicus rigens, commonly known as sandspurre, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing annual or biennial plant that thrives in dry, sandy, or rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, and its leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs. It has a creeping growth habit with stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Sandspurre is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields."
