    "intro": "Canna discolor, commonly known as the white cannas, is a striking ornamental plant native to the wetlands of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, often with a reddish or purple hue on the underside. The plant produces showy, spadix-like flowers surrounded by vibrant, often white or pink bracts, which are the primary ornamental feature. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Canna discolor is a perennial herb that is widely cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and water features."
