    "intro": "Cymatocarpus heterophyllus, commonly known as the giant water chestnut, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It has a robust, rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread rapidly in wetland environments. The plant features broad, floating leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, providing shade and habitat for aquatic life. Its distinctive, spiky seed pods develop underwater and can float to the surface once mature. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
