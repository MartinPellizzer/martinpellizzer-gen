    "intro": "Carpinus coreensis, commonly known as the Korean hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, winged samaras that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often marked with shallow fissures. Carpinus coreensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
