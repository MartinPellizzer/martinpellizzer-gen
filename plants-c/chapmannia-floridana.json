    "intro": "Chapmannia floridana, commonly known as the Florida chapman grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland areas and is characterized by its tufted clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, which are typical of the grass family. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in its wetland habitat. Chapmannia floridana is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes."
