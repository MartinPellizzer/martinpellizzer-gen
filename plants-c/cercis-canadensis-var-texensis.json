    "intro": "Cercis canadensis var. texensis, commonly known as the Texas redbud, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces flat, bean-like pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a rough texture that becomes more pronounced with age. The Texas redbud is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
