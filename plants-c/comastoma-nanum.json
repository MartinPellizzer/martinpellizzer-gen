    "intro": "Comastoma nanum, commonly known as the dwarf pincushion flower, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the western United States. It features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Comastoma nanum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
