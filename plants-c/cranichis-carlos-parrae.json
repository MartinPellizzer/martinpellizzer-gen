    "intro": "Cranichis carlos-parrae, commonly known as the Carlos Parra orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flower spikes that bear small, fragrant blossoms in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions with partial shade. Its rhizomes are fibrous, and it has narrow, grass-like leaves that help it survive in its harsh environment. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
