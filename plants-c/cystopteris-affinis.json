    "intro": "Cystopteris affinis, commonly known as the common water fern, is a fern species native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with finely divided pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in woodland areas. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Cystopteris affinis plays an important role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
