    "intro": "Cephalanthus spinosus, commonly known as the common arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture, often turning red in the fall. Cephalanthus spinosus is often found in moist woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
