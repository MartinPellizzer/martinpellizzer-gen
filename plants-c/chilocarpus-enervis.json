It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels and cinnamon trees. The plant is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are drupes, typically containing a single seed, and are dispersed by birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
