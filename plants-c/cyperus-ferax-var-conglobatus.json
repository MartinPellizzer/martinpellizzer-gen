It features slender, grass-like stems with narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, compact cluster. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by specialized bracts. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical structure makes it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
