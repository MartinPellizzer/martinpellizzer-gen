    "intro": "Ctenitis fulgens, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a bright yellow to orange coloration on the underside. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a unique arrangement of leaflets that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Ctenitis fulgens is valued in horticulture for its vibrant color and ability to thrive in specific tropical conditions."
