    "intro": "Cyanocarpus cribbiana, commonly known as the Ceylon ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Sri Lanka and southern India. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and hard, heavy wood that is highly valued for construction and furniture. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a vulnerable species."
