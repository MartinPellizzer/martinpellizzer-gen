    "intro": "Cystanthe scoparia, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. Cystanthe scoparia is well adapted to arid environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops."
