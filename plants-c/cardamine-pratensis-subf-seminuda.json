    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis subf. seminuda, commonly known as the slender water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist meadows and wetlands in Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairless and have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its root system consists of fibrous roots that help anchor it in wet soil. This subspecies is distinguished by its reduced leaf hairs and slightly elongated leaves compared to the typical form of Cardamine pratensis."
