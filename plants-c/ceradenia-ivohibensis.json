    "intro": "Ceradenia ivohibensis, commonly known as the Ivohibena orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and specialized growth habits. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth where it thrives on nutrient-poor soil. Its flowers are small and delicate, often displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink, and it plays a significant role in the local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
