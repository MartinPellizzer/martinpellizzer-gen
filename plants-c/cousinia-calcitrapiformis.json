    "intro": "Cousinia calcitrapiformis, commonly known as the limestone sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, which helps it conserve moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, aiding in reducing water loss. Cousinia calcitrapiformis is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability."
