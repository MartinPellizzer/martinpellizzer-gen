    "intro": "Cardamine californica proles cardiophylla, commonly known as the California water shield, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its submerged or floating leaves that are often heart-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its small white flowers appear in early spring, and it produces aquatic fruits that disperse via water. The plant plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic life and maintaining water quality."
