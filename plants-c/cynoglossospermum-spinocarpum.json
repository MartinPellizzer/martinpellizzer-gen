    "intro": "Cynoglossospermum spinocarpum, commonly known as the spiny fruit cynoglossum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Sudan and Ethiopia. The plant is characterized by its hairy, spiny capsules that contain small, round seeds. It typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, with woody stems and lobed leaves. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
