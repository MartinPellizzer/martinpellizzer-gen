    "intro": "Cyperus lorentzianus var. elatus, commonly known as the tall flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. It is often found in floodplains, riverbanks, and other waterlogged habitats."
