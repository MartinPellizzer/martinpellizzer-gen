    "intro": "Centaurea calcarea, commonly known as the limestone cudweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Centaurea calcarea is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and thistles."
