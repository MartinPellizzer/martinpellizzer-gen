It is characterized by its striking silver-blue foliage, which becomes more pronounced in the autumn. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its slender, upright growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. It produces feathery plumes in the summer, adding visual interest to the garden."
