    "intro": "Chrysanthemum palustre, commonly known as marsh chrysanthemum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist or waterlogged soils, often found along the edges of ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, yellow to white, and arranged in clusters, blooming from late summer to autumn. Chrysanthemum palustre is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging wetland environments."
