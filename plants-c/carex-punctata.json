    "intro": "Carex punctata, commonly known as the dotted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown in color. Native to various regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant's rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland gardens and ecological restoration projects."
