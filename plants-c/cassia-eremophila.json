    "intro": "Cassia eremophila, commonly known as the desert cassia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures in dry conditions. The plant produces yellow, fluffy flowers in spring, which are followed by elongated, narrow pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought, with deep roots and a slow growth rate. Cassia eremophila is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
