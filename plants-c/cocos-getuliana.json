    "intro": "Cocos getuliana, commonly known as the Cuban coconut tree, is a species of palm native to the island of Cuba. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to three meters in length. The plant produces large, fibrous fruits that contain a single seed, which is used for propagation. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
