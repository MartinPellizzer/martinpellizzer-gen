It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer. Centauropsis laurifolia is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to gardens, though it is not widely cultivated."
