    "intro": "Cissus angustata, commonly known as the narrowleaf grape ivy, is a climbing plant native to tropical Africa. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible, round, yellow berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for trellises and vertical gardens."
