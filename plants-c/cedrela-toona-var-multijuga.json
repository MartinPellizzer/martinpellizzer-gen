    "intro": "Cedrela toona var. multijuga, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree species native to Central and Eastern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that are alternate and glossy green. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an important species for ecological and economic purposes in its native regions."
