It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, showing adaptations to drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
