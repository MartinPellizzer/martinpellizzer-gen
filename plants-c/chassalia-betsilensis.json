    "intro": "Chassalia betsilensis, commonly known as the Betselel lily, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences composed of multiple narrow, strap-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually blue or violet in color, with a distinctive three-lobed structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chassalia betsilensis is considered a rare and endemic species."
