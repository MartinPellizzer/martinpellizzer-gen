    "intro": "Cormonema biglandulosum, commonly known as the hairy corm plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melanthiaceae. It is characterized by its underground corms, which serve as storage organs for nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a hairy texture, giving it its common name. It is native to certain regions of South America and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
