    "intro": "Celtis reticulosa, commonly known as the netvein hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive netted venation pattern. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, pale green fruits that mature to a reddish-brown color. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine, and the tree is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. Celtis reticulosa plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for wildlife."
