It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves and vibrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its small, daisy-like flowers range in color from yellow to orange, often appearing in late winter to early spring.
