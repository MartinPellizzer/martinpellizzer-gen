    "intro": "Corymbium salteri, commonly known as the Salter's corymbium, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a small, herbaceous shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Corymbium salteri is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
