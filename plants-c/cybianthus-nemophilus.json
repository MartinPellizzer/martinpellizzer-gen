    "intro": "Cybianthus nemophilus, commonly known as the woodland bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the temperate regions of Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Cybianthus nemophilus is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
