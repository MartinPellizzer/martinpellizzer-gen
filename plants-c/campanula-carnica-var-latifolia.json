It features basal rosettes of broad, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically hairy and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, bell-like blooms."
