    "intro": "Carica pubescens, commonly known as the hairy papaya, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Caricaceae family and is characterized by its large, lobed leaves covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces yellow-orange fruits that are similar in appearance to the common papaya but are typically smaller and less commonly cultivated. Its flowers are clustered in inflorescences and are often visited by insects, contributing to its pollination. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional uses in herbal medicine."
