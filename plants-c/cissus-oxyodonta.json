    "intro": "Cissus oxyodonta, commonly known as the rock fig or climbing cissus, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a vigorous climber with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in shaded areas. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
