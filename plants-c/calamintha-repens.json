    "intro": "Calamintha repens, commonly known as creeping calamint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features aromatic, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its scent is reminiscent of mint, and it is sometimes used in herbal teas or as a culinary herb. Calamintha repens is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported calming and digestive properties."
