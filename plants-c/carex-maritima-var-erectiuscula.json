    "intro": "Carex maritima var. erectiuscula, commonly known as salt marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It typically grows in saline or brackish wetlands, thriving in muddy or sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it a key component of salt marsh ecosystems."
