    "intro": "Cephalantheropsis laciniata, commonly known as the slit-leaf lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often divided, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Cephalantheropsis laciniata is a terrestrial orchid that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchid species."
