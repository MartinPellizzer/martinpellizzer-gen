    "intro": "Contarena, commonly known as the golden star or star cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and includes several species that are often cultivated for their ornamental value. The plants typically have a short, thick stem with clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. Contarena species are succulent plants, adapted to arid environments, and they store water in their fleshy stems. They are popular in rock gardens and as container plants due to their compact size and vibrant blooms."
