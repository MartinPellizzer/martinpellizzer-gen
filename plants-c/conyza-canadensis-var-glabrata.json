It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides and fields. It has finely dissected leaves and produces wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its invasive potential in some regions. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological studies and weed management."
