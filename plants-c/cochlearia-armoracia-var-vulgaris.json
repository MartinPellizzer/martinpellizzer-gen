    "intro": "Cochlearia armoracia var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common scurvygrass, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, typically blooming from April to June. It thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, often found along the shorelines of the British Isles. The species is notable for its historical use in preventing scurvy due to its high vitamin C content."
