    "intro": "Camarotis callosa, commonly known as the roughleaf sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, well-drained environments. The plant features a basal rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring or early summer. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it an interesting subject for botanical study in xerophytic ecosystems."
