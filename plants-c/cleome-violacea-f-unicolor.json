It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces bright white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are often hairy and branching, with a distinctive, somewhat zigzag appearance. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade."
