It produces showy, saucer-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that allow it to survive harsh winter conditions. Crocus grandiflorus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
