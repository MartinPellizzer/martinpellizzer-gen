    "intro": "Cotula alpina, commonly known as alpine groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has narrow, silvery-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Cotula alpina thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and flowers."
