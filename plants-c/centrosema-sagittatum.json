    "intro": "Centrosema sagittatum, commonly known as the arrowhead centrosema, is a perennial legume native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically heart-shaped or arrowhead-like in appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by hairy, pod-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Centrosema sagittatum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
