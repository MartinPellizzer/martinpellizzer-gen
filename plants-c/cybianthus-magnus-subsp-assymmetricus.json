    "intro": "Cybianthus magnus subsp. assymmetricus, commonly known as the asymmetric giant cybianthus, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, asymmetrical leaves that vary in shape and size, often exhibiting a unique bilateral asymmetry. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically a vibrant mix of red and orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
