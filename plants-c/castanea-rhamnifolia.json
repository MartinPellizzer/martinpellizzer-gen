It belongs to the family Betulaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by spiny, oval nuts enclosed in a thick, woody husk. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils. The plant has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
