    "intro": "Cardamine leucantha f. toensis, commonly known as the Toens River celandine, is a rare fern-like plant native to specific regions in East Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble those of true celandines. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in early spring, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
