    "intro": "Cytisus capitatus var. decumbens, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, elliptical leaflets. It is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
