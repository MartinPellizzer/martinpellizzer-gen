    "intro": "Cacalia leopoldii, commonly known as Leopold's bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, seed-like fruits called cypselae. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
