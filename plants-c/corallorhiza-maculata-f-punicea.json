    "intro": "Corallorhiza maculata f. punicea, commonly known as the pink-stemmed coralroot, is a unique orchid species that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, often reddish or pinkish stem that is usually unbranched. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish, with a faintly colored lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodlands and pine forests. This orchid is a fascinating example of a hemiparasitic plant, showcasing specialized adaptations for survival in nutrient-poor soils."
