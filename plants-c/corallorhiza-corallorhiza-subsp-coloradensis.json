    "intro": "Corallorhiza corallorhiza subsp. coloradensis, commonly known as the Colorado coralroot, is a member of the orchid family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph. This subspecies relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrition, absorbing nutrients through its roots. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodlands. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers arranged in a spike, and it is often found in the western United States. Due to its reliance on specific fungi and habitat conditions, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
