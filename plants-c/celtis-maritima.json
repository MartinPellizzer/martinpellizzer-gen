    "intro": "Celtis maritima, commonly known as the maritime hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal woodlands. Celtis maritima is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal environments."
