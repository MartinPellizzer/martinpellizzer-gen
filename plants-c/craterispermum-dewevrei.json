    "intro": "Craterispermum dewevrei, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes many shrubs and small trees adapted to cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically evergreen, leathery, and arranged in a compact, shrub-like form. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
