It is characterized by its vibrant, often multicolored leaves that can range from deep green to red and yellow. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
