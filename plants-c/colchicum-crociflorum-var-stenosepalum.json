    "intro": "Colchicum crociflorum var. stenosepalum, commonly known as the narrow-sepal colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features striking, showy flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, with narrow, elongated sepals. The plant produces a bulbous corm, which serves as its primary storage organ and helps it survive in harsh alpine conditions. Its foliage consists of basal, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. This variant is notable for its distinct floral morphology and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils at higher elevations."
