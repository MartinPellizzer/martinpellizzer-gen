    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 zaslawskii, commonly known as the Zaslawskii Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid that combines the traits of Cattleya mossiae and Cattleya labiata. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and sometimes feature a yellow lip. The plant is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. The Zaslawskii Cattleya is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its vibrant blooms and long-lasting flowers."
