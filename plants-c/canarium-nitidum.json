    "intro": "Canarium nitidum, commonly known as the white ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and glossy, providing dense foliage. Canarium nitidum is often found in lowland rainforests and is important for both ecological and economic reasons."
