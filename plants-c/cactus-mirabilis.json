    "intro": "Cactus mirabilis, commonly known as the \"dragon tree\" or \"ornamental cactus,\" is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, branching stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red, typically blooming in the spring. Its succulent nature allows it to store water in its stems, making it well adapted to arid environments. Cactus mirabilis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
