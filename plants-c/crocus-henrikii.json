    "intro": "Crocus henrikii, commonly known as the Henrik's crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters and features narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
