    "intro": "Cyathea abruptecaudata, commonly known as the abruptecaudate tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in lowland forests. Its rhizome is thick and segmented, supporting the growth of its tall, erect stem. The fronds are bioluminescent, which helps in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
