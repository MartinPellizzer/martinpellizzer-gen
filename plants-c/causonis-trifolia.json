    "intro": "Causonis trifolia, commonly known as the three-leaved bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its simple, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged in water. The plant is a carnivorous species, capable of trapping and digesting small aquatic organisms. It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a whorl, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations."
