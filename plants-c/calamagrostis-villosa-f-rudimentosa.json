    "intro": "Calamagrostis villosa f. rudimentosa, commonly known as the silky bluegrass or the silky feathergrass, is a grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-blue foliage and tufted inflorescences that resemble plumes. This ornamental grass thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its foliage is covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive, almost feathery appearance. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
