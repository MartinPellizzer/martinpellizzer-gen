    "intro": "Clematis gouriana, commonly known as the African clematis, is a deciduous climbing shrub native to southern Africa. It features compound leaves that are typically trifoliate, with three ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its vines can reach lengths of up to 10 meters, making it an excellent choice for trellises or pergolas. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
