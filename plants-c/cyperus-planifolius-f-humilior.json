    "intro": "Cyperus planifolius f. humilior, commonly known as the dwarf flatleaf sedgeland, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in water gardens or as a ground cover in boggy areas. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
