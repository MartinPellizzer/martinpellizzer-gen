    "intro": "Crepis viscidula subsp. geracioides, commonly known as sticky hawk's-beard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features basal and cauline leaves that are hairy and often glandular, with a sticky texture. Its yellow composite flowers are arranged in a single head, with ray florets and tubular disc florets. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth habit and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other crepis species."
