    "intro": "Crypsis crucianelloides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with pale greenish-white petals and a distinctive, elongated flower spike. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
