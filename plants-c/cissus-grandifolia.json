    "intro": "Cissus grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leafed devil's ivy, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often used in traditional medicine. Its ability to climb and its ornamental foliage make it a popular houseplant."
