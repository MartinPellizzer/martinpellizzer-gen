    "intro": "Calceolaria incana, commonly known as the woolly slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces distinctive flowers with a pouch-like structure, typical of the Calceolaria genus. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice among gardeners and botanists alike."
