    "intro": "Chymocarpus tricolor, commonly known as the pink-flowered sweet grass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its distinctive pink or purple flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, three-lobed seeds enclosed in a fibrous husk, which is a feature of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its colorful inflorescences and its ability to attract pollinators."
