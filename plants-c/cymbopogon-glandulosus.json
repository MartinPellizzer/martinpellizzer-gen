    "intro": "Cymbopogon glandulosus, commonly known as lemongrass, is a tall perennial grass native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves that emit a strong lemon scent due to the presence of citral and other essential oils. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with clustered inflorescences at the tips of its stems. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common ornamental and medicinal plant. The leaves are widely used in culinary, aromatic, and traditional medicinal applications."
