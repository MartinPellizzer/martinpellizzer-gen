    "intro": "Cissus crithmifolia, commonly known as the sea grape or coastal ivy, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in small, white, sticky glands. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found growing along rocky coastlines and in coastal dunes. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in coastal gardens."
