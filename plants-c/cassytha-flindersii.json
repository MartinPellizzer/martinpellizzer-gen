    "intro": "Cassytha flindersii, commonly known as the Flinders morning glory, is a climbing herbaceous plant native to Australia. It features slender, twining stems that can grow up to several meters in length, allowing it to climb and entangle other vegetation. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Cassytha flindersii is adapted to a range of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and shaded environments."
