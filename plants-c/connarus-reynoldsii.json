It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems, typical of many shrubs in its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
