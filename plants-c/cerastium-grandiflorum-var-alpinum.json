    "intro": "Cerastium grandiflorum var. alpinum, commonly known as alpine mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, aiding in water retention in cold, arid environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a common sight in mountainous landscapes. Its compact growth habit and frost resistance make it well-suited for alpine gardens and rockeries."
