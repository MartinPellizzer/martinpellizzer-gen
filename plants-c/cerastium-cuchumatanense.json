    "intro": "Cerastium cuchumatanense, commonly known as the Cuchumatan alpine mouse-ear, is a perennial herb native to the Andean highlands of Bolivia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, hairy leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its native habitat. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for small invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
