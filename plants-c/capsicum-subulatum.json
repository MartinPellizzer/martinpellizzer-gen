    "intro": "Capsicum subulatum, commonly known as the slender capsicum or desert pepper, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and small, yellow or orange fruits that mature in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture conditions. Its botanical features include hairy stems and small, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss. Capsicum subulatum is closely related to other chili pepper species but is less commonly cultivated for its edible fruits."
