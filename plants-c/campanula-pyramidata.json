    "intro": "Campanula pyramidata, commonly known as the pyramid bellflower, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and produces small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Campanula pyramidata is known for its long blooming period, often from late spring through early summer."
