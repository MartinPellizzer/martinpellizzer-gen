    "intro": "Cyrtoceras reflexum, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a unique and recognizable appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as gemmae, are produced in specialized leaf-like structures called gemma cups. Cyrtoceras reflexum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
