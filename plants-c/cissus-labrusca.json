    "intro": "Cissus labrusca, commonly known as the grape ivy, is a climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with silver or white markings. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible berries that resemble grapes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cissus labrusca is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and ease of care."
