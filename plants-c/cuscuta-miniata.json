    "intro": "Cuscuta miniata, commonly known as the dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that attach to host plants through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant is native to various regions of the world, including parts of North America and Europe. It typically grows on grasses, sedges, and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants."
