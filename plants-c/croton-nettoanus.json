    "intro": "Croton nettoanus, commonly known as the velvetleaf croton, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often a deep green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain areas."
