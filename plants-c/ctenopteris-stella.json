    "intro": "Ctenopteris stella, commonly known as the star sori fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, feather-like segments. The plant produces sori, which are clusters of spore cases, arranged in a star-like pattern along the underside of the fronds. Ctenopteris stella thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental horticulture."
