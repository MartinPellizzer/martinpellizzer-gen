It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Cicercula sativa is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in agricultural settings."
