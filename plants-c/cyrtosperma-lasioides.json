    "intro": "Cyrtosperma lasioides, commonly known as the rough-seeded cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it produces cones rather than flowers. The plant has a stout, unbranched stem that is covered with a thick, fibrous sheath. Its leaves are large, pinnately compound, and are often used in traditional medicine. The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and has been cultivated for its unique foliage and historical significance."
