    "intro": "Cassytha muelleri, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic plant native to Australia. It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using haustoria, which absorb nutrients. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, white flowers that are often overlooked. It thrives in humid environments and is commonly found in rainforests and along riverbanks. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants if left unchecked."
