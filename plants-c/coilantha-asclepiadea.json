It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Coilantha asclepiadea is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
