    "intro": "Capellenia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Capellenia has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its habitat specificity and declining population, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
