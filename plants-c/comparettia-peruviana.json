    "intro": "Comparettia peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian bellflower, is a tropical plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Comparettia peruviana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in greenhouses and gardens for its unique floral display."
