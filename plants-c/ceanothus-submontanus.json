    "intro": "Ceanothus submontanus, commonly known as the subalpine ceanothus, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of leathery, dark green leaves with a bluish tint. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant blue or purple flowers in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for landscaping in cooler climates."
