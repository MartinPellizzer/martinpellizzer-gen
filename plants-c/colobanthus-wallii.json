    "intro": "Colobanthus wallii, commonly known as Antarctic hair grass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Colobanthus wallii is adapted to cold climates and is considered a pioneer species in harsh environments."
