    "intro": "Castanea floridana, commonly known as the Florida chestnut, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. The plant produces small, spiny fruits called nuts, which are encased in a thick, hairy husk. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, while its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Due to its limited range and susceptibility to diseases, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
