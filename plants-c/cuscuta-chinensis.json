    "intro": "Cuscuta chinensis, commonly known as Chinese dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to East Asia and is often found growing on crops such as soybeans and cotton. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, making it a persistent weed in agricultural areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the yield of its host plants."
