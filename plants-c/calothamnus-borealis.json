    "intro": "Calothamnus borealis, commonly known as the northern flame bush, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Calothamnus borealis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soils."
