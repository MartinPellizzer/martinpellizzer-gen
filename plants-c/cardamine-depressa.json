    "intro": "Cardamine depressa, commonly known as the creeping water cress, is a small perennial herb native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It typically grows in rocky or streamside habitats, where it thrives in cool, damp conditions. The plant has a low-growing, spreading habit with trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small white or pale yellow flowers appear in early spring and are clustered in umbels. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
