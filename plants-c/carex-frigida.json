    "intro": "Carex frigida, commonly known as the Arctic sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic animals. Carex frigida is adapted to cold climates and can survive in areas with limited growing seasons."
