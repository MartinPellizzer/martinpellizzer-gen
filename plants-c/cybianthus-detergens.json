    "intro": "Cybianthus detergens, commonly known as the soap plant, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a woody stem and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. Its scientific name reflects its historical use in creating a soapy lather when crushed, making it useful for cleaning. Cybianthus detergens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas."
