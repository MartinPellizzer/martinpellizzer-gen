It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Carex divisa var. rivularis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
