    "intro": "Chamaesyce emarginata, commonly known as the marginal sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically has a sprawling habit with numerous branching stems that lie close to the ground. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. Its flowers are yellow, with five petals, and appear in clusters at the ends of the stems. Chamaesyce emarginata is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species in harsh environments."
