    "intro": "Crataegus poliophylla, commonly known as the white thornapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 leaflets, and its showy white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for wildlife. Crataegus poliophylla is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, and it plays a role in supporting local ecosystems."
