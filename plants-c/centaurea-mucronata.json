    "intro": "Centaurea mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-horned centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its small, spiny bracts and pale blue to purple flowers make it distinctive. Centaurea mucronata is often found in Mediterranean regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
