    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 haywoodianum, commonly known as the Haywood lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or white flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in rich, organic soils. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces a single flower per stem, which blooms in early to mid-spring. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
