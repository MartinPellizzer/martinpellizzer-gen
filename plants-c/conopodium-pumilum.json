    "intro": "Conopodium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands. It has no true roots and instead relies on rhizoids for anchorage. Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptations make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
