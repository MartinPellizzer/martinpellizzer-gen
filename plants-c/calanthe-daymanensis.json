    "intro": "Calanthe daymanensis, commonly known as the Dayman's calanthe, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces striking, lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant blooms with showy, white to pale pink flowers that are arranged in a raceme, featuring prominent sepals and petals. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
