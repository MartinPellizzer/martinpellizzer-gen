    "intro": "Carex muricata, commonly known as the sharp-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, upright leaves that have a rough, serrated texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. Carex muricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
