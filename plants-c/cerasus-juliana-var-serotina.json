    "intro": "Cerasus juliana var. serotina, commonly known as the late cherry or late-blooming cherry, is a variety of Prunus species native to Japan. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its showy pink to white flowers that bloom later in the spring compared to other cherry varieties. The plant produces small, sweet-tart berries that are edible but not as widely consumed as other cherry fruits. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. Its late flowering trait makes it a valuable addition to pollinator habitats and adds visual interest to gardens in late spring."
