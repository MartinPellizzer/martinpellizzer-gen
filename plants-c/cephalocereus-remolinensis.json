    "intro": "Cephalocereus remolinensis, commonly known as the Remolin's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a dense covering of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, red fruits that are edible and often consumed by wildlife. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and cactus enthusiasts."
