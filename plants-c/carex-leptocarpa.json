    "intro": "Carex leptocarpa, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of brownish or pale green flowers, typically in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Carex leptocarpa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
