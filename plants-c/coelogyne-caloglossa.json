    "intro": "Coelogyne caloglossa, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and green flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry periods. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28, providing a waxy surface that reduces water loss. Coelogyne caloglossa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
