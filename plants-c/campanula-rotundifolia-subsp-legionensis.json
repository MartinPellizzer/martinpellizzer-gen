    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia subsp. legionensis, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features rosettes of rounded, hairy leaves and produces bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Campanula rotundifolia."
