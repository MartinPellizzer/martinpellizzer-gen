    "intro": "Chamaecrista cytisoides var. brachystachya, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed burr legume, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces clusters of yellow to orange flowers, followed by distinctive, spiny pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
