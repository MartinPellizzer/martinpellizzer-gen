    "intro": "Calligonum parvulum, commonly known as the small-flowered sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are adapted for pollination by wind or insects. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Calligonum parvulum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion."
