    "intro": "Cyclosorus iridescens, commonly known as the iridescent water clover, is a species of aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like leaves that exhibit a striking iridescent sheen. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant's leaves are arranged in a whorled pattern, often floating on the water surface or partially submerged. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in clusters. Cyclosorus iridescens plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for microorganisms."
