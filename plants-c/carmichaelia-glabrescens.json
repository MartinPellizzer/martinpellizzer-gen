    "intro": "Carmichaelia glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically significant in its native habitat. The fronds are used in traditional M\u0101ori culture for various purposes, including basket weaving."
