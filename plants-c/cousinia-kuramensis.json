    "intro": "Cousinia kuramensis, commonly known as the Kuram sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Cousinia kuramensis is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to high-altitude conditions."
