    "intro": "Cirsium eorythros, commonly known as the red-stemmed thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with a robust root system that allows it to thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a distinctive reddish hue on the underside, contributing to its common name. Cirsium eorythros is often found in alpine meadows and is an important species for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
