    "intro": "Capnoides adiantifolia, commonly known as the fern moss or lesser capillary moss, is a small, delicate moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its densely packed, leaf-like structures that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant forms compact cushions or mats, often growing on shaded, moist rock surfaces or soil. Its leaves are usually narrowly linear and have a smooth, sometimes slightly curled margin. Capnoides adiantifolia is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in cool, humid environments."
