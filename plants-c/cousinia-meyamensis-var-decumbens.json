    "intro": "Cousinia meyamensis var. decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate cousinia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, pinkish to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with wiry, succulent stems that lie close to the ground. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in regions with limited rainfall."
