    "intro": "Cochlia, commonly known as the sea snail or certain species of gastropod mollusks, is a diverse group of marine and terrestrial invertebrates. These organisms are characterized by their spiral-shaped shells and muscular foot used for locomotion. Cochlia species play a vital role in marine ecosystems as both predators and prey. They are often found in coastal areas, rocky shores, and shallow waters. Their presence is an indicator of the health and biodiversity of aquatic environments."
