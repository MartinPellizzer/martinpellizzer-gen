    "intro": "Cyclosorus dicarpus, commonly known as the two-seeded water clover, is a rare aquatic fern native to parts of Asia. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. Its reproductive structures include two small, spirally arranged spore cases on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality."
