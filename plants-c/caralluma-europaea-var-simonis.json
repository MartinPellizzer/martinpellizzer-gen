    "intro": "Caralluma europaea var. simonis, commonly known as the European horned cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
