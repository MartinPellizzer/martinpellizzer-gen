    "intro": "Circaea major, commonly known as lesser white-speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and features opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its scientific name reflects its historical use in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
