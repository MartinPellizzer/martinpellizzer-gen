    "intro": "Condylocarpon breviarticulatum, commonly known as the short-articulate lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which is typical of lichens. It is often found growing on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and tropical regions. Its structure and growth patterns make it an important indicator species for environmental conditions."
