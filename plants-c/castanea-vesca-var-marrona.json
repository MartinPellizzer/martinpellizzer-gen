    "intro": "Castanea vesca var. marrona, commonly known as the Persian hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces small, oval nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which mature in the autumn. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cold winter dormancy period for proper fruit development. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, while the bark is smooth and grayish-brown. This variety is valued for its edible nuts and is often cultivated for both ornamental and agricultural purposes."
