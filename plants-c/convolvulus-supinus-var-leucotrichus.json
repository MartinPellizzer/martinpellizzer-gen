    "intro": "Convolvulus supinus var. leucotrichus, commonly known as the white-haired prostrate bindweed, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe. It features small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with five lobes and a hairy appearance. The plant has thin, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
