    "intro": "Chrysanthemum leucanthemum subsp. maximum, commonly known as the greater white ragwort, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are aromatic and often covered in a powdery coating. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
