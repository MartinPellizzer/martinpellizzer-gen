    "intro": "Cepa vulgaris, commonly known as the common onion, is a biennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its bulbous stem, which stores nutrients and water, allowing it to survive harsh conditions. The plant produces long, hollow, cylindrical leaves that are typically green and blade-like. Its flowers are small, white or greenish, and clustered in umbels, which attract pollinators. The bulb is the economically important part of the plant, used extensively in cooking and traditional medicine."
