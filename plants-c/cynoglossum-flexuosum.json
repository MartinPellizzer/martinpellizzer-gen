It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a creeping root system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Cynoglossum flexuosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
