    "intro": "Carex hordeistichos var. microstachys, commonly known as the dwarf beak sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of water bodies. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. This variety is distinguished by its shorter stature and finer staminal hairs compared to other members of the species."
