    "intro": "Cheiridopsis angustifolia subsp. protoparcoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its hardiness and low maintenance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in coastal and Mediterranean climates."
