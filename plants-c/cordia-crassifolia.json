    "intro": "Cordia crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaf cordia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds. Cordia crassifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
