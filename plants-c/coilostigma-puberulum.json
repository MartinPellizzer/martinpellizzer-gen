    "intro": "Coilostigma puberulum, commonly known as the woolly bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, pubescent stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by inflated, bladder-like pods that contain seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Coilostigma puberulum is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard family plants."
