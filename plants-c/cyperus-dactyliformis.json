    "intro": "Cyperus dactyliformis, commonly known as the arrowhead sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, three-sided flower clusters. Cyperus dactyliformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
