It belongs to the genus Cymopterus in the family Onagraceae, which includes several species of evening primroses. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a sprawling, herbaceous growth habit. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its adaptation to arid environments."
