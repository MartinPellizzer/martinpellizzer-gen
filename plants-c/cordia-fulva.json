    "intro": "Cordia fulva, commonly known as the red cedar or flame tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, reddish-bark and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red or orange berries. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a slightly waxy texture, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Cordia fulva is also valued for its wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
