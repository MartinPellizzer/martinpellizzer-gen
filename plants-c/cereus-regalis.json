    "intro": "Cereus regalis, commonly known as the night bloomer or queen of the night, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it store water and withstand arid conditions. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. The plant's unique blooming pattern and striking appearance make it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
