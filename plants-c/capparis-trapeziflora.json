It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its fruit is a capsule containing several seeds, and the plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils. It is often found in coastal areas and is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, sunny conditions."
