    "intro": "Cerastium arvense var. suffruticosum, commonly known as creeping mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a mat-forming growth habit, making it well-suited for ground cover. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological restoration and ornamental gardening."
