    "intro": "Caroxylon scopiforme, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink to white. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep taproots and thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it an important species in desert ecosystems. Caroxylon scopiforme is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
