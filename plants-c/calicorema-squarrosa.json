    "intro": "Calicorema squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrosa bracket fungus, is a unique and rare fungal species that belongs to the family Polyporaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, bracket-shaped fruiting bodies that are typically pale yellow to brown in color. This fungus is saprophytic, meaning it decomposes dead wood, and is often found on decaying hardwoods in temperate forests. Its spore-producing surface is smooth and covered with small, rounded pores rather than gills. Calicorema squarrosa is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a rare and seldom encountered species in mycology."
