    "intro": "Centrostachys fruticosa, commonly known as the creeping centipede grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It forms dense, mat-like growth and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for erosion control and ground cover. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly and establish quickly in various soil types."
