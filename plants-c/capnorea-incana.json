    "intro": "Capnorea incana, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads. Capnorea incana thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures."
