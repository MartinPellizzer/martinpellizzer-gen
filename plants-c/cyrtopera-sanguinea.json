It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves with deep red veins and its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are usually pale green or white with a subtle pink or red hue, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.
