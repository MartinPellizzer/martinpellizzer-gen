    "intro": "Cryptochilus strictus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and swampy habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are often obscured by the foliage. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Cryptochilus strictus plays a role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and nectar for various insect pollinators."
