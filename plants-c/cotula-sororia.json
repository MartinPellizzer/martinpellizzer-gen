    "intro": "Cotula sororia, commonly known as the small-flowered dandelion, is a small annual herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters, with hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by fluffy seed heads similar to those of dandelions. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it prefers well-drained soils in open, sunny habitats. Cotula sororia is often found in disturbed areas and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
