    "intro": "Ctenitis lanigera, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. The plant's unique morphology makes it a striking addition to botanical gardens and a subject of interest in plant taxonomy."
