    "intro": "Clermontia gaudichaudii var. singuliflora, commonly known as the single-flowered clermontia, is a rare and endemic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its unique, solitary flower that typically blooms in shades of pink or white. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves and thrives in shaded, moist environments within its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this rare botanical species."
