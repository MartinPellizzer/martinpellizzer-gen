    "intro": "Commirhoea mecocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale purple, with distinctive spurred petals. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds when mature."
