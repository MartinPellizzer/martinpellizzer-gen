It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and small, ovate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forest or savanna habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
