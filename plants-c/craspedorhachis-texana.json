    "intro": "Craspedorhachis texana, commonly known as the Texas craspedorhachis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the southwestern United States, particularly Texas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in limestone habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
