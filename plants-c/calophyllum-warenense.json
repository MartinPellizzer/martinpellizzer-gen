    "intro": "Calophyllum warenense, commonly known as the Caribbean sandpaper tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its rough, bark-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, orange-colored fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in dry, sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used for ornamental purposes or in reforestation projects."
