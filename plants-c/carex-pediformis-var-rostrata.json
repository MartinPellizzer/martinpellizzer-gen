    "intro": "Carex pediformis var. rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The variety rostrata is distinguished by its elongated, pointed bracts at the base of the inflorescence."
