    "intro": "Cupressus \u00d7 leylandii, commonly known as the Leyland cypress, is a hybrid evergreen conifer native to the United Kingdom. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and scale-like foliage that is typically a deep green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones and is valued for its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types. It is widely used in landscaping for hedges and privacy screens due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. However, it is susceptible to certain diseases, such as cypress shot hole disease, which can affect its longevity."
