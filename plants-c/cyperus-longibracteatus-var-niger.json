    "intro": "Cyperus longibracteatus var. niger, commonly known as black flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common wetland species. The blackish coloration of its bracts gives it its distinctive appearance and contributes to its ecological role in aquatic environments."
