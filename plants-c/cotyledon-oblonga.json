    "intro": "Cotyledon oblonga, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. Cotyledon oblonga is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appearance."
