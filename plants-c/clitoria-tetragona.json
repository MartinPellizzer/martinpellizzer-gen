    "intro": "Clitoria tetragona, commonly known as the winged bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive purple or violet flowers that resemble small butterflies. The plant produces pods containing edible seeds and a starchy, tuberous root known as the \"devil's bean.\" It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often grown as a forage crop or for its nutritional value. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it a valuable plant in sustainable agriculture."
