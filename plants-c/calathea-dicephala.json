    "intro": "Calathea dicephala, commonly known as the Double-Headed Calathea, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Marantaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bi-colored leaves that display a combination of green, white, and pink hues. The plant's leaves are often described as having a \"double-headed\" appearance due to the contrasting patterns on either side. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Calathea dicephala is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its unique foliage."
