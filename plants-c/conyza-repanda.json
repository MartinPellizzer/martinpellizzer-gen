    "intro": "Conyza repanda, commonly known as the common ironweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as roadsides and disturbed areas, and it thrives in temperate climates. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in clusters, and the plant produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Conyza repanda is often considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting pollinators."
