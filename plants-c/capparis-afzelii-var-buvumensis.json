    "intro": "Capparis afzelii var. buvumensis, commonly known as the Buvumensis caper, is a species of flowering plant in the Capparidaceae family. It is native to parts of East Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its prickly stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom throughout the dry season. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some areas."
