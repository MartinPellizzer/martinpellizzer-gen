    "intro": "Calceolaria glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular calceolaria, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, hooded flowers that resemble small cups, with a distinctive bilobed lower lip. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, which give it its scientific name. Calceolaria glandulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
