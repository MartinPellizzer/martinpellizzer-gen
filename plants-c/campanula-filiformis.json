    "intro": "Campanula filiformis, commonly known as the slender bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, elongated fruits called capsules. Campanula filiformis is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging growing conditions."
