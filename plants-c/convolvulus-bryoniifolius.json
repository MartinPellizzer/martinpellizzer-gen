It is characterized by its heart-shaped, silver-veined leaves and trumpet-shaped, pale purple to white flowers. The plant is a climbing vine that produces small, round berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
