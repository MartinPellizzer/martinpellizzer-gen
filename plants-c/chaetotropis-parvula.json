    "intro": "Chaetotropis parvula, commonly known as the small hairgrass, is a small, perennial grass species native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, flowering structures typical of the grass family. Chaetotropis parvula plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
