It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its pale green to silver-gray foliage is a distinguishing feature, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
