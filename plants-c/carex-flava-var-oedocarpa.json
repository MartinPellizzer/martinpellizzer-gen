    "intro": "Carex flava var. oedocarpa, commonly known as the yellow sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically bright yellow to green in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often hidden among the foliage, making it less showy than other sedges. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is noted for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
