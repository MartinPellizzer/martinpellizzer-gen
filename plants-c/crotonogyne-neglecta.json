    "intro": "Crotonogyne neglecta, commonly known as the Hawaiian croton, is a small shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
