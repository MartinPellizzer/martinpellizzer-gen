It is a variant of the horse chestnut tree, characterized by its delayed flowering period compared to the typical species. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is known for its ornamental value due to its showy white flowers and large, palmately lobed leaves. Its fruit, a spiny capsule, contains edible nuts that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree is relatively cold-hardy and can thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a versatile addition to gardens and landscapes."
