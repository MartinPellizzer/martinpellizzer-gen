    "intro": "Cousinia angrenii, commonly known as the Karakum Cousin, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia, particularly found in the arid regions of the Karakum Desert. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flower heads that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Cousinia angrenii is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its resilience in extreme conditions."
