    "intro": "Cupressus obtusa f. formosana, commonly known as the Formosan lacebark cypress, is a unique variant of the Japanese cypress. It is characterized by its distinctive, exfoliating bark that reveals a network of pale, fibrous layers beneath. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized evergreen tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are densely packed, giving the tree a compact and ornamental appearance. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticultural landscapes for its unique texture and color contrast."
