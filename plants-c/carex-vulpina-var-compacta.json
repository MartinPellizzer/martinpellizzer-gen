    "intro": "Carex vulpina var. compacta, commonly known as the compact marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and three-ranked leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for wetland restoration and ornamental use in water gardens. It thrives in full to partial sun and requires consistent moisture for optimal growth."
