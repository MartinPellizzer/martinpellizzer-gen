    "intro": "Croton malvifolius, commonly known as the velvetleaf croton, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny capsules containing seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
