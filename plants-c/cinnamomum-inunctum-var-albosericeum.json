    "intro": "Cinnamomum inunctum var. albosericeum, commonly known as the white silky cinnamon, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the cinnamon plant. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan province. The plant is characterized by its pale, almost white, silky hairs covering its leaves and stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, fragrant flowers followed by dark red berries. Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
