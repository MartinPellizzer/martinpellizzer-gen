    "intro": "Cystopus serriformis, commonly known as the serrated bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water and has thin, branching stems covered in tiny, leaf-like structures. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually green or yellowish in color. Cystopus serriformis is an important part of aquatic ecosystems, contributing to nutrient cycling through its predatory activity."
