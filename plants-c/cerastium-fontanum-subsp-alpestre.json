    "intro": "Cerastium fontanum subsp. alpestre, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered with fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its cold, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes."
