    "intro": "Coalisina paradoxa, commonly known as the paradoxical coalisina, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to deep violet. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coalisina paradoxa is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
