    "intro": "Castanola sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran castanola, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Sumatra. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that enclose a single seed, which is often used in traditional medicine. Castanola sumatrana thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
