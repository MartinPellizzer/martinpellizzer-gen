    "intro": "Clintonia borealis f. albicarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited Clintonia, is a rare and striking member of the Melanthiaceae family. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pale green, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces distinctive white, fleshy fruits that are unique to this form, setting it apart from the typical red-fruited variety. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
