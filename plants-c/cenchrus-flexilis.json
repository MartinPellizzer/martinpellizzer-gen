    "intro": "Cenchrus flexilis, commonly known as the flexible grass or slender fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its narrow, erect leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its fibrous roots help in soil stabilization, making it useful in erosion control. Cenchrus flexilis is also valued for its potential in forage and as a cover crop in agricultural systems."
