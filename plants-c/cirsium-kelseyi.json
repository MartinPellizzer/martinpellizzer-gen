    "intro": "Cirsium kelseyi, commonly known as the Kelsey's thistle, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, purple-blue flower heads that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall prickly appearance. Cirsium kelseyi is often found in rocky or semi-arid habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
