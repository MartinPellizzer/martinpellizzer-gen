    "intro": "Clusia parvula, commonly known as the small clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and capable of forming a dense underground network, which helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Clusia parvula is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate various soil conditions."
