    "intro": "Calystegia fulcrata subsp. pedicellata, commonly known as the slender morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its twining stems and trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant produces small, round berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and attractive flowers make it a popular ornamental plant, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
