    "intro": "Clidemia tristis, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Caribbean, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small white or pink flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and is often found in humid, shaded environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host and is sometimes considered a weed in forest ecosystems."
