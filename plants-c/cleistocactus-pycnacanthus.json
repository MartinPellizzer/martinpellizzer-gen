    "intro": "Cleistocactus pycnacanthus, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in the late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
