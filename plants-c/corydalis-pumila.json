    "intro": "Corydalis pumila, commonly known as the dwarf corydalis, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping stems and clusters of small, pinkish-purple flowers. The plant typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, making it well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers bloom in early spring. Corydalis pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique floral display."
