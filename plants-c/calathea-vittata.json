    "intro": "Calathea vittata, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with intricate patterns of green, silver, and pink. The leaves are oval-shaped and often curl up at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Calathea vittata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and air-purifying properties."
