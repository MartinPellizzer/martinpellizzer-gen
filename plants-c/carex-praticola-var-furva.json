    "intro": "Carex praticola var. furva, commonly known as the dark-fringed sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has grass-like leaves that are often dark green with a distinctive purplish tinge along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are usually green to brown in color. This sedge is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
