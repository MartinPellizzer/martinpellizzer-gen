    "intro": "Cheilanthes hostilis, commonly known as the hostile fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction. Cheilanthes hostilis is a hardy, low-maintenance plant often used in xeriscaping due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
