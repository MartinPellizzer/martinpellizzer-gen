    "intro": "Calamagrostis arundinacea f. effusa, commonly known as the silver feather reed grass, is a variant of the common reed grass characterized by its distinctive silver-blue foliage. It is a clump-forming perennial grass that thrives in moist to wet soils, making it suitable for wetland gardens or pond edges. The plant produces tall, slender panicles of small, feathery flowers in late summer to early autumn. Its ornamental value lies in its soft, flowing foliage and elegant flowering display. It is often used in landscaping for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions and its low maintenance requirements."
