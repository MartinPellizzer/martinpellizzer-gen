    "intro": "Casuarina microstrobilus, commonly known as the small-strobilus casuarina, is a species of evergreen tree native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Casuarinaceae and is characterized by its unique, needle-like foliage that resembles the appearance of a pine tree. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Casuarina microstrobilus is adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a common feature in coastal landscapes. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various native species and stabilizing dune environments."
