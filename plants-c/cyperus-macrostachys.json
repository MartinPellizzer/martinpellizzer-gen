    "intro": "Cyperus macrostachys, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, umbrella-shaped clusters of pale green to brown flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, including marshes and along water edges. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in moist soils. Cyperus macrostachys is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
