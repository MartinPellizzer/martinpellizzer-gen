    "intro": "Campanula brachiata, commonly known as the bellflower or rock bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a white throat. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are hairy and erect. Campanula brachiata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
