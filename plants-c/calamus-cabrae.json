    "intro": "Calamus cabrae, commonly known as the Cape sugar cane, is a member of the Aroid family (Araceae). It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant features long, narrow leaves that can grow up to several meters in length, often with a bluish-green coloration. It produces a spadix, a characteristic inflorescence typical of arums, which is surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Calamus cabrae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
