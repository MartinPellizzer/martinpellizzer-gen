    "intro": "Carex acuta var. dioica, commonly known as the sharp beak sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant has triangular stems and produces spikes of small, usually greenish or brownish flowers. It is distinguished by its dioecious nature, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
