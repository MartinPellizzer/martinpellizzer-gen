    "intro": "Castilleja grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has specialized roots that attach to the roots of host plants, allowing it to extract water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces small, yellowish-green stems. Castilleja grandiflora is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands."
