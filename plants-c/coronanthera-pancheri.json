    "intro": "Coronanthera pancheri, commonly known as the Christmas Star, is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bloom during the rainy season, usually between November and March. Its unique floral structure and vibrant colors make it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation. However, it is considered rare and is often found in specific, moist forest habitats."
