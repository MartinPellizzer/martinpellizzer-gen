    "intro": "Chirita mangshanensis, commonly known as the Mangshan chirita, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within forest understories, showcasing its adaptation to humid, low-light conditions. Its leaves are usually ovate with a smooth texture, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chirita mangshanensis is considered a conservation concern."
