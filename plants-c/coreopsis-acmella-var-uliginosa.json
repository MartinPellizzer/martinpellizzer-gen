It is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in moist, acidic soils. It is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
