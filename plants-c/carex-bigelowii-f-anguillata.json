    "intro": "Carex bigelowii f. anguillata, commonly known as the bigelow's sedge, is a variant of the bigelow sedge, characterized by its distinctive foliage and growth habits. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America, typically found in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often a deep green, and it produces spikes of small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species. The subspecies anguillata is distinguished by its elongated, twisting inflorescence, which gives it a unique appearance among sedges."
