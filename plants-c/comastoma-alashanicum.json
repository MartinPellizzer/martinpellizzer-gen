    "intro": "Comastoma alashanicum, commonly known as the Alashan bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss. Comastoma alashanicum is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
