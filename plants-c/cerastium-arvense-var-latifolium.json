    "intro": "Cerastium arvense var. latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The leaves are heart-shaped, broad, and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its larger, more robust leaves compared to the typical form of Cerastium arvense."
