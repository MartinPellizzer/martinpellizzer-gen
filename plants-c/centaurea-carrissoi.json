    "intro": "Centaurea carrissoi, commonly known as the Corsican knapweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking blue to purple composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Centaurea carrissoi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
