    "intro": "Coleus forskalaei, commonly known as the red-leaved coleus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful foliage rather than its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that can range in color from deep red to purple and green, making it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, often used in garden borders or as a houseplant. Its ornamental value lies primarily in its striking leaf patterns and ability to add visual interest to both indoor and outdoor spaces."
