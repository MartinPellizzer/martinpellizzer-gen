    "intro": "Columnea septentrionalis, commonly known as the Northern flame flower, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant red-orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting hummingbirds and other pollinators. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that are opposite and ovate in shape. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea septentrionalis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical and subtropical gardens."
