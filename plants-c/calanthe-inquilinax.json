    "intro": "Calanthe inquilinax, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and possesses a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces a single, upright stem bearing several lance-shaped leaves and a raceme of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. Calanthe inquilinax thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a unique and ornamental addition to specialized horticultural collections."
