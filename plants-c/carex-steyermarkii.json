    "intro": "Carex steyermarkii, commonly known as Steyermark's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually green or brown, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Carex steyermarkii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
