    "intro": "Cephalophyllum tricolorum, commonly known as the three-colored headplant, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, three-toned flowers that range from yellow to orange to red, creating a vivid visual contrast. The plant has fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. Its leaves are typically small and arranged in a rosette pattern, providing structural support and reducing water loss. Cephalophyllum tricolorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable environments."
