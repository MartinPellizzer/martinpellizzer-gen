The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, giving it a striking appearance. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The bark is smooth and often has a reddish or greyish hue, which adds to its ornamental value."
