    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis var. woodsioides, commonly known as the brittle maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species characterized by its finely divided, bi-lobed fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to eastern North America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's fronds are typically light green and have a fragile, almost papery texture, which gives it its common name. It produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. This variety is often found in rocky crevices and along stream banks, where it forms dense, low-growing colonies."
