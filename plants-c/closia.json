    "intro": "Closia, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. Closia species are often found in woodland or grassland habitats, and they play a role in supporting local pollinator populations. However, some species are toxic and should be handled with care."
