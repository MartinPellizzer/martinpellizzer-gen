    "intro": "Cynanchum obovatum, commonly known as the broad-ovate milkweed, is a perennial herb native to regions of Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. It is characterized by its lanceolate to obovate leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant contains toxic compounds, including cardiac glycosides, which can be harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for certain pollinators, though its toxicity limits its use in horticulture."
