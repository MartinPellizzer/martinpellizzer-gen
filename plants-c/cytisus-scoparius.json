    "intro": "Cytisus scoparius, commonly known as goat's rue, is a flowering shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and bright yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Cytisus scoparius is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
