    "intro": "Chaetogastra membranifolia, commonly known as the membranous leaf chaetogastra, is a unique member of the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a thin, membranous layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, often white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
