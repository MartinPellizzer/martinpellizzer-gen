    "intro": "Collare-stuartense, commonly known as the Stuart's collar plant, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive collar-like structure at the base of its stem, which is a key botanical feature. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in montane forests. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a waxy surface, aiding in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
