    "intro": "Comanthera bisulcata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, ribbed stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a distinctive midrib. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to reddish in color, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a notable feature of its botanical makeup. Comanthera bisulcata plays an important role in local ecosystems, particularly as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
