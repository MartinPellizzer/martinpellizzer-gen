    "intro": "Chromolaena foliata, commonly known as the stinging nettle plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves with fine, hair-like structures that can cause skin irritation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white seeds dispersed by the wind. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including forests and grasslands. Due to its invasive nature in some areas, it is sometimes considered a weed."
