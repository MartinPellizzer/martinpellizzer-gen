    "intro": "Crataegus kaussmanniana, commonly known as the Kaussmann hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, elliptical leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
