It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically yellow or green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the spring and summer months. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant color and compact growth habit. Cotyledon xanthantha is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens or containers."
