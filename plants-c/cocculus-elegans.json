    "intro": "Cocculus elegans, commonly known as the elegant devil's backbone, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, warty, and ridged fruit that resembles a serpent's spine, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, palmately lobed, and have a rough, textured surface. Cocculus elegans is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental foliage and unique fruit structure."
