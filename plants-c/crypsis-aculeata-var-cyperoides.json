    "intro": "Crypsis aculeata var. cyperoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in a triangular cross-section, a characteristic feature of many sedges. The flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce small, wind-pollinated flowers that are often inconspicuous."
