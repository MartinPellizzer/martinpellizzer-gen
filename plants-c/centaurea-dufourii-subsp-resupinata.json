    "intro": "Centaurea dufourii subsp. resupinata, commonly known as the creeping centaury, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in compact heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
