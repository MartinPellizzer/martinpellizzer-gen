    "intro": "Carex leucodonta, commonly known as the white-flowered sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces dense clusters of white or pale blue flowers. Native to northern regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and wetlands, preferring cool, temperate climates. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it an effective ground cover in suitable habitats."
