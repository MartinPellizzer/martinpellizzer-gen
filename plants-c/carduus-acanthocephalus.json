    "intro": "Carduus acanthocephalus, commonly known as the prickly lettuce, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant features a rosette of spiny, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Its seeds are small and can be dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. The plant has been used historically in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
