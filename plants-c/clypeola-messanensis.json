It is characterized by its small, shield-shaped leaves and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. Clypeola messanensis is known for its delicate white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
