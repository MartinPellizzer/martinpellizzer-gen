    "intro": "Carex secalina var. secalina, commonly known as the common sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often in marshy areas or along streambanks. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by water or animals. Carex secalina var. secalina is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
