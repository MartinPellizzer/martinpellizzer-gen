    "intro": "Coffea jasminoides, commonly known as the jasmine coffee or yellow coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Ethiopia, and is characterized by its fragrant white flowers and small, yellowish berries. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and emit a strong jasmine-like aroma. While not widely cultivated for coffee production, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique fragrance and ornamental value."
