    "intro": "Cylactis egopodioides, commonly known as the ghostly sea anemone, is a rare and enigmatic marine organism belonging to the order Ceriantharia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent polyp-like structure that resembles a ghostly appendage, often found attached to coral or rock in deep-sea environments. This species lacks a true medusa stage and instead exhibits a unique life cycle that involves a solitary, tube-dwelling polyp. Its botanical classification places it within the class Ceriantharia, which includes other deep-sea anemone-like organisms. Due to its elusive nature and limited study, much remains unknown about its ecological role and reproductive habits."
