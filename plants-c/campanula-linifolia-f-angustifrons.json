    "intro": "Campanula linifolia f. angustifrons, commonly known as narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. It features lanceolate, often hairy leaves that are narrower than those of the typical species, giving it a distinct appearance. The flowers are typically blue to violet in color, with five lobed petals that open in late spring to early summer. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings."
