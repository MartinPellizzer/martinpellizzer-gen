    "intro": "Comandra umbellata, commonly known as the goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow, umbrella-shaped flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Comandra umbellata is also known for its medicinal properties, having been used by Native American tribes for various healing purposes."
