    "intro": "Capparis oligantha, commonly known as the desert caper, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Capparis oligantha is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
