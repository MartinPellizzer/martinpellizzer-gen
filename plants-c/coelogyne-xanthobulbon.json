    "intro": "Coelogyne xanthobulbon, commonly known as the golden bulb orchid, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow pseudobulbs and long, arching inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive dry periods. Coelogyne xanthobulbon is a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
