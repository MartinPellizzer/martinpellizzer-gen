    "intro": "Cheiranthera, commonly known as the false spider orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, spider-like appearance, with long, slender petals and a unique, often fragrant flower structure. Native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and Australia, Cheiranthera species typically thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. The plants are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Their botanical significance lies in their ornamental value and role in ecological systems."
