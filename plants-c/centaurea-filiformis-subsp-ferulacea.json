    "intro": "Centaurea filiformis subsp. ferulacea, commonly known as the slender cornflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to purple flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly longer and more slender form compared to the typical variety of Centaurea filiformis."
