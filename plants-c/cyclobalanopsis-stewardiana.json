    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis stewardiana, commonly known as the Stewart's ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or pale green, followed by oval, leathery nuts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native habitats."
