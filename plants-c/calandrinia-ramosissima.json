    "intro": "Calandrinia ramosissima, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, branched growth habit and produces vibrant red or pink flowers that bloom throughout the summer. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it well adapted to dry climates and suitable for drought-tolerant gardens."
