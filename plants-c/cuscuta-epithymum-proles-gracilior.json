    "intro": "Cuscuta epithymum proles gracilior, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its host to establish a connection. The plant is native to various regions of Europe and is often found growing on grasses and other low-growing vegetation. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas easily. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant stress to its host plants, affecting their growth and health."
