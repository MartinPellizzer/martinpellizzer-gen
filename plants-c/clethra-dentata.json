    "intro": "Clethra dentata, commonly known as the toothed clethra, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in clustered inflorescences during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Clethra dentata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
