    "intro": "Cyperus atribulbus, commonly known as the swamp spikerush, is a flowering plant in the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. Its cylindrical, grass-like stems are often reddish or purple, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters. Cyperus atribulbus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
