    "intro": "Carpha andina, commonly known as Andean sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andes region of South America. It typically grows in moist, high-altitude environments such as mountain meadows and wetlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or brown in color. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in its native habitat. Carpha andina is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
