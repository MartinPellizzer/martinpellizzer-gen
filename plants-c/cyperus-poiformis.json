    "intro": "Cyperus poiformis, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical cluster of leaves that resemble an umbrella, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets, which are clustered along the stem. Cyperus poiformis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along water bodies. It is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes used in landscaping and water gardens."
