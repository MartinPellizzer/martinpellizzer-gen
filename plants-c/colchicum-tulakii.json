    "intro": "Colchicum tulakii, commonly known as the Armenian colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It belongs to the Colchicaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant features a bulb-like structure called a corm, which stores nutrients for the plant's survival during dormant periods. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that emerge from the base of the corm. Colchicum tulakii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also of interest in botanical research due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
