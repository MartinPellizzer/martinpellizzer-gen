    "intro": "Carex obliquicarpa, commonly known as the slanting-fruited sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to North America and is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear triangular, three-sided berries. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. Carex obliquicarpa is a perennial herb that thrives in temperate climates."
