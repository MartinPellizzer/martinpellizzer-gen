    "intro": "Coprosma propinqua var. typica, commonly known as the coastal coprosma, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, which is typically a vibrant green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months, followed by bright red berries that are a food source for native birds. It thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for coastal landscaping and erosion control."
