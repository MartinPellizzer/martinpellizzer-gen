    "intro": "Cissus vandenbrandeana, commonly known as the African snow vine, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the edges. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
