    "intro": "Citrus megaloxycarpa, commonly known as the giant citrus or large-fruited citron. It is a rare and ancient citrus species characterized by its large, elongated fruits that can weigh up to several kilograms. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and is known for its thick, aromatic rind and minimal edible pulp. Botanically, it belongs to the Rutaceae family and is closely related to other citrus species like the common lemon and orange. Due to its limited natural distribution and cultivation, it is considered a valuable species for genetic research and conservation efforts."
