It features bright yellow flowers with a distinctive red or purple central disk, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and can grow up to 1 meter tall. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions."
