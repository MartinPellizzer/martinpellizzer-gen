    "intro": "Cassia triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered cassia, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants. Cassia triflora typically grows in open, sunny areas and prefers well-drained soils. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open when mature, releasing the seeds to the ground."
