It features long, narrow leaves with a wavy, undulating edge, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in low to moderate light conditions and is well-suited for planted aquariums. It prefers soft, slightly acidic water and can tolerate a range of temperatures. Its delicate foliage makes it an excellent choice for creating a natural, flowing look in freshwater habitats."
