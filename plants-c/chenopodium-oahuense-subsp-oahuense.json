    "intro": "Chenopodium oahuense subsp. oahuense, commonly known as Oahu goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Oahu. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as coastal sands and rocky areas. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a rough, textured surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. It plays a role in the local ecosystem and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to the island's environment."
