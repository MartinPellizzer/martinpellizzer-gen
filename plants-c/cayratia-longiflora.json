    "intro": "Cayratia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered cayratia, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by small, berry-like fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. Cayratia longiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shaded garden settings."
