    "intro": "Canthium ventosum, commonly known as the windweed or slender mallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Canthium ventosum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
