    "intro": "Cytinus ruber subsp. ruber, commonly known as the crimson broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and derives its nutrients from the roots of host plants. It is characterized by its distinctive red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a short, thick stem with a single flower at the top, and its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem by relying on host plants for survival."
