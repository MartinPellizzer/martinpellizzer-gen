    "intro": "Chasmanthe bicolor, commonly known as the red-hot cat's tail, is a striking member of the Iridaceae family native to southern Africa. It features vibrant orange to red flowers that bloom in late summer, forming dense, torch-like clusters at the end of its sword-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with a compact, bushy habit that makes it well-suited for gardens and containers. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, providing a lush backdrop to its showy blooms. Chasmanthe bicolor thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for warm climates."
