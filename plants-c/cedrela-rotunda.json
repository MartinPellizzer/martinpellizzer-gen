    "intro": "Cedrela rotunda, commonly known as the round cedrela or velvetwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by round, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly waxy texture. Cedrela rotunda is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
