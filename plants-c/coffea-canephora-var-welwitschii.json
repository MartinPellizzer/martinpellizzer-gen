    "intro": "Coffea canephora var. welwitschii, commonly known as the Congo coffee or Congo Arabica, is a variant of the robusta coffee species native to Central and Western Africa. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped beans and a distinct flavor profile that is often described as having a nutty and slightly bitter taste. The plant typically grows in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. It is known for its relatively high caffeine content compared to other coffee varieties. This variety is primarily cultivated for its use in specialty coffee blends and is less common than other coffee types in global markets."
