    "intro": "Cicuta officinalis, commonly known as water hemlock, is a highly toxic member of the parsley family (Apiaceae). It is characterized by its hollow, ridged stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white umbels of flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wet, disturbed soils along stream banks and marshes. Due to its potent toxicity, it is considered one of the most dangerous plants in North America."
