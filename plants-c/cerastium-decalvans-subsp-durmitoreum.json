It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The subspecies is distinguished by its reduced leaf hairs and shorter, more compact growth habit compared to the typical form. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cold climates. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and provides nectar for pollinators."
