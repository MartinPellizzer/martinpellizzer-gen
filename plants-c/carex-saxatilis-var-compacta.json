    "intro": "Carex saxatilis var. compacta, commonly known as the compact sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, typically forming low, mat-like clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in rocky or streamside habitats. Its hardy nature makes it a suitable choice for wetland gardens and naturalized landscapes."
