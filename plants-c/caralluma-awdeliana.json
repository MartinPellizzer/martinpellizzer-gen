    "intro": "Caralluma awdeliana, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, helping to minimize water loss and deter herbivores."
