    "intro": "Crepidium robinsonii, commonly known as the Robinson's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant has a compact growth habit, typically forming a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
