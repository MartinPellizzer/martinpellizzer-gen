    "intro": "Cliffortia lepida, commonly known as the silver leafed daisy, is a small, herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers with yellow centers, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
