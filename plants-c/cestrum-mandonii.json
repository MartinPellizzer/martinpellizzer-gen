    "intro": "Cestrum mandonii, commonly known as the sweet trumpet, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in summer. These flowers are adapted for pollination by night-flying moths, and the plant is known for its strong, sweet scent. Cestrum mandonii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in suitable climates."
