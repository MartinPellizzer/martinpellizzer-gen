    "intro": "Crataegus spissa, commonly known as the prickly pear or hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are edible for humans and wildlife. Crataegus spissa is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in botanical studies."
