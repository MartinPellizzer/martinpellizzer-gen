    "intro": "Coptis, commonly known as goldthread, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. It consists of several species, including Coptis chinensis and Coptis japonica, which are native to Asia. These plants are characterized by their erect stems, trifoliate leaves, and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The roots of Coptis species contain alkaloids, such as berberine, which have medicinal properties. They are often found in moist, shaded environments in forests and along stream banks."
