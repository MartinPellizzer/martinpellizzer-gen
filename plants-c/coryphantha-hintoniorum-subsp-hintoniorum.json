    "intro": "Coryphantha hintoniorum subsp. hintoniorum, commonly known as the Hinton's prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its globose, ribbed stems that are typically green with spines and are covered in a white, powdery coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh desert conditions."
