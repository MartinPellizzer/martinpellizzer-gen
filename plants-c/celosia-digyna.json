    "intro": "Celosia digyna, commonly known as the flame flower or crown of thorns, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its foliage is often covered in fine, hairy hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the axils of the leaves. Celosia digyna is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
