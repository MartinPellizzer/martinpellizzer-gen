    "intro": "Campanula fruticosa, commonly known as the shrub bellflower, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has woody stems that become more pronounced with age, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped and slightly hairy. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Campanula fruticosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
