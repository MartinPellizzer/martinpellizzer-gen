    "intro": "Cirsium salinum, commonly known as saltweed or sea thistle, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species for coastal ecosystems. Cirsium salinum is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine."
