    "intro": "Calathea exscapa, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, intricately patterned leaves that change color and orientation in response to light and temperature, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage features a combination of green, silver, and pink hues, creating a visually appealing display. Calathea exscapa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic value and air-purifying properties."
