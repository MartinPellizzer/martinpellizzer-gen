The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique appearance and seasonal flowering make it a notable species in the Combretaceae family."
