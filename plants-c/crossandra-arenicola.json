    "intro": "Crossandra arenicola, commonly known as the sand crossandra, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and bright orange to red tubular flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand saline and drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
