    "intro": "Cotoneaster minutus, commonly known as the dwarf cotoneaster, is a small evergreen shrub native to China. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and seasonal color changes. Cotoneaster minutus is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
