    "intro": "Crepis vesicaria subsp. taraxacifolia, commonly known as the meadow cinquefoil, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a hairy texture, while the stems are upright and covered in fine hairs. This subspecies is often mistaken for dandelions due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its smaller, more delicate flowers and specific habitat preferences."
