    "intro": "Calathea trichoneura, commonly known as the leopard calathea, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves with a distinctive leopard-like pattern of green, silver, and rust-colored markings. The plant belongs to the Marantaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Calathea trichoneura is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its unique foliage and air-purifying properties."
