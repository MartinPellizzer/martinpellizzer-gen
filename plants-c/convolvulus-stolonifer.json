    "intro": "Convolvulus stolonifer, commonly known as the spreading bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively along the ground. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pale purple or white, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and the plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats. Convolvulus stolonifer is often considered a weed due to its invasive nature and persistent seed production."
