    "intro": "Cyathea pinnata, commonly known as the shuttlecock tree or feather fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for many decades, making it a long-lived species. Its fronds are typically bright green and have a delicate, feathery appearance. Cyathea pinnata plays an important role in tropical rainforest ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to forest structure."
