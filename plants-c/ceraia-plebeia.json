    "intro": "Ceraia plebeia, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a herbaceous plant native to various regions of Europe. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a distinguishing characteristic. Ceraia plebeia plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
