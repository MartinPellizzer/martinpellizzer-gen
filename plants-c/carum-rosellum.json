    "intro": "Carum rosellum, commonly known as roseapple or roselle, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive cup-shaped calyx that becomes inflated and holds water, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly serrated edge. The fruit, which develops from the calyx, is edible and has a tart, cranberry-like flavor."
