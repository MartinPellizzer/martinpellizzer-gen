    "intro": "Colymbada finazzeri, commonly known as the Finazzeri's colymbada, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Colymbadaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, aquatic-like appearance, with slender stems and small, translucent leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich waters, often in temperate regions. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water's surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
