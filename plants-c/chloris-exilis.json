    "intro": "Chloris exilis, commonly known as slender grass or narrowleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are followed by narrow, awned seeds. Chloris exilis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soils."
