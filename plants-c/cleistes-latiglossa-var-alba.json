    "intro": "Cleistes latiglossa var. alba, commonly known as the white cleistocarp, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, closed flowers that remain tightly sealed throughout much of the growing season. The plant produces showy, white, hooded blooms that open only briefly at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. Its foliage consists of opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. This rare species is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands."
