    "intro": "Corallocarpus gijef, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, pale green or white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Corallocarpus gijef is considered a conservation concern."
