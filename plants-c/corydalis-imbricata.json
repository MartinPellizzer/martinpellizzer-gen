The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Corydalis imbricata is valued in horticulture for its attractive foliage and blooms, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
