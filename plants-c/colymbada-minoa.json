    "intro": "Colymbada minoa, commonly known as the Mediterranean water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and marshes. The plant features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are showy, with white petals and yellow stamens, and bloom from late spring to early autumn. Colymbada minoa plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
