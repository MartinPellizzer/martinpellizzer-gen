    "intro": "Chiritopsis lobulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chiritopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Due to its low water requirements, it is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
