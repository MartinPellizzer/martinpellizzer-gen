    "intro": "Caryophyllata aquatica, commonly known as the water carnation, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments. It features showy, pink to red petals that resemble those of carnations, hence its common name. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss. Caryophyllata aquatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
