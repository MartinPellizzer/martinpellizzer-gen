It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces vibrant pink to red blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
