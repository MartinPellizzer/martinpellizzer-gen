    "intro": "Ceratochloa carinata var. hookeriana, commonly known as the Hooker's ridgegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinct midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in alpine ecosystems."
