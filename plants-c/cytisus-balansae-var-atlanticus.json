    "intro": "Cytisus balansae var. atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic broom, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often sprawling stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, trifoliate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh coastal environment. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is tolerant of salt spray, making it well-suited to coastal habitats. Its ornamental value and ecological role in stabilizing dunes make it an important species in its native range."
