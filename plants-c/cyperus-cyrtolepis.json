It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as swamps and riverbanks. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and establish in moist soils."
