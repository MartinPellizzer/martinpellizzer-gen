    "intro": "Crataegus tomentosa var. pubifolia, commonly known as the pubifoliate hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, ovate leaves that are pubescent, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open fields. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
