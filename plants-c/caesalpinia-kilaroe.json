    "intro": "Caesalpinia kilaroe, commonly known as the red sandalwood or kilaroe, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, and its striking red or orange-pink flower spikes that bloom in spring. The plant produces elongated, woody pods that contain several seeds, and it is adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. Caesalpinia kilaroe is often found in coastal heathlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
