It is a perennial legume characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or semi-arid environments. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
