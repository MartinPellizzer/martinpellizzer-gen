    "intro": "Campanula elatines, commonly known as the water bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Campanula elatines is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in wet conditions."
