    "intro": "Centropogon psilandrus, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of northern South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, adapting to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Its roots are often submerged, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
