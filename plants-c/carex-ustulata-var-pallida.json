    "intro": "Carex ustulata var. pallida, commonly known as the pale sand sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically pale green to bluish-gray in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are usually found in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and wet meadows. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
