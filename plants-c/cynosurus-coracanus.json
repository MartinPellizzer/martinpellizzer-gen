    "intro": "Cynosurus coracanus, commonly known as the rough bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Cynosurus coracanus is often found in low nutrient soils and is an important component of many temperate ecosystems."
