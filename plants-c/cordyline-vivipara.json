    "intro": "Cordyline vivipara, commonly known as the swamp cabbage, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by red or purple berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies. Cordyline vivipara is also known for its ability to propagate through vivipary, where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant."
