It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. This variety is closely related to other cytisus species and is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
