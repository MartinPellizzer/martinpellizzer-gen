It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow or orange flowers that resemble a crown, hence its common name. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Calappa coronata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
