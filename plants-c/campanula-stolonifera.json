    "intro": "Campanula stolonifera, commonly known as the spreading bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, which allows it to spread horizontally and form dense mats. The plant produces showy blue to violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems. Campanula stolonifera thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in garden landscaping for its ornamental value."
