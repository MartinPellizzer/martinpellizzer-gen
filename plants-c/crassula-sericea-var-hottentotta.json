It features dense, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
