    "intro": "Cassine pilosa, commonly known as the woolly cassine, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. Cassine pilosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
