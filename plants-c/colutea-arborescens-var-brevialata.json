    "intro": "Colutea arborescens var. brevialata, commonly known as the short-leaved broomrape, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and thrives in dry, open habitats. Due to its lack of chlorophyll, it is a parasitic plant, relying on host species for nutrients."
