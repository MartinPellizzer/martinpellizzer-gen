    "intro": "Chromolaena odorata, commonly known as the \"Milkweed\" or \"Goatweed,\" is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas, Africa, and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fluffy, white to pale pink seed heads. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it an invasive species in many regions. Chromolaena odorata is also used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
