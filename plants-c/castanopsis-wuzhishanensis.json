It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a woody cupule. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous areas with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
