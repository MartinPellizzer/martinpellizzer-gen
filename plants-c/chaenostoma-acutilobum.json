It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a distinctive acute lobing at the base. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, usually appearing in late spring to early summer. The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in aquatic environments and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
