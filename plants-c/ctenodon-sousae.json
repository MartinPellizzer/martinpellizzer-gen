    "intro": "Ctenodon sousae, commonly known as the dwarf African cycad, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features a short, stout stem with a crown of hard, leathery leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. Its reproductive structures include a cone-like inflorescence, typical of cycads, which produces both male and female flowers. Ctenodon sousae is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient and interesting subject for botanical study."
