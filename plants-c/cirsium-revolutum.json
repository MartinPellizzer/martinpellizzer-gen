    "intro": "Cirsium revolutum, commonly known as the rough thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, rough leaves and purple to pinkish flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. Its leaves are covered with stiff, backward-curving hairs, which give it its common name. The flowers are usually visited by pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance."
