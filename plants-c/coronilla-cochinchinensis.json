It is a perennial legume that produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or white. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. It plays a role in soil stabilization due to its deep root system and nitrogen-fixing ability. Its seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
