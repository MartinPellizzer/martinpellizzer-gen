    "intro": "Combretum sphaeroides, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spherical seed pods and its ability to produce vibrant red or orange flowers during the dry season. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. It is drought-tolerant and often used in ornamental landscaping due to its striking appearance. The bark and leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties."
