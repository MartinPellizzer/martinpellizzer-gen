    "intro": "Cocculus cynanchoides, commonly known as the Indian snakeroot, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its roots have been used traditionally in herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. However, due to its toxicity, it is not recommended for medicinal use without professional guidance."
