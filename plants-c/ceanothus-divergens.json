    "intro": "Ceanothus divergens, commonly known as the bluecurls, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking blue or purple flower clusters that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, silvery-blue coating. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
