It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are linear and pointed, with a rough texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Cyperus acutiusculus plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
