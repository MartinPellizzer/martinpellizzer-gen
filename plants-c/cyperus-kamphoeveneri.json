    "intro": "Cyperus kamphoeveneri, commonly known as the velvet marsh grass, is a species of sedge native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, poorly drained soils. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous root system and small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
