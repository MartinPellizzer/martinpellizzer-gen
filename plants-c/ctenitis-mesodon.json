    "intro": "Ctenitis mesodon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, wiry fronds that are often clustered in dense tufts. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on rock surfaces or in moist soil. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds. Ctenitis mesodon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
