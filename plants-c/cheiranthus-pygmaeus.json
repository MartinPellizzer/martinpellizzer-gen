    "intro": "Cheiranthus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf crownflower, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which is characterized by its cross-shaped flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with narrow, linear leaves and small, white or pale purple flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, often in regions with mild, Mediterranean climates. Due to its limited size and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
