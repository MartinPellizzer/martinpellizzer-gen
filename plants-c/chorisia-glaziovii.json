    "intro": "Chorisia glaziovii, commonly known as the desert candle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid regions of Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its tall, candle-like stem and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its bark is smooth and gray, often peeling in thin layers. Chorisia glaziovii is adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species."
