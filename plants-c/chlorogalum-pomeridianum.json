    "intro": "Chlorogalum pomeridianum, commonly known as the evening glory, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces striking white or pink flowers that open in the late afternoon and close at night, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The plant is also known for its edible bulbs, which have a mild, nutty flavor."
