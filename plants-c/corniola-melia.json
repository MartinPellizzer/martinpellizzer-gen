It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant features velvety, waxy leaves that are typically heart-shaped and come in various shades of green. Its showy, tubular flowers bloom in shades of violet, pink, and white, often with a contrasting center. Corniola melia thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
