    "intro": "Carex lurida var. divergens, commonly known as the pink sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and bog environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically pink to reddish in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its unique coloration and ecological role, it is valued in wetland restoration projects and botanical gardens."
