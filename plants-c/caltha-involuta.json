    "intro": "Caltha involuta, commonly known as the spoonwort or lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often submerged in water, as it typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Caltha involuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting early pollinators."
