    "intro": "Centroclinium albicans, commonly known as the white-centred cinquefoil, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, five-petaled white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has basal leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being oval and hairy. Its root system is fibrous and often forms a dense mat, which helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Centroclinium albicans is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
