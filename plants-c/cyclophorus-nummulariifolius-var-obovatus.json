    "intro": "Cyclophorus nummulariifolius var. obovatus, commonly known as the broad-leafed cyclophorus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are broad and obovate in shape, adapted to store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the warmer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
