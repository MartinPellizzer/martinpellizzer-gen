    "intro": "Campanula lanata, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, woolly stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name \"lanata,\" derived from the Latin word for \"wool.\" The plant produces bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Campanula lanata is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated for its attractive foliage and flowers."
