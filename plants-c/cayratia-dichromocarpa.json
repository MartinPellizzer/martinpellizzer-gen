It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically dark green with a contrasting lighter underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by elliptical, dark blue to black berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
