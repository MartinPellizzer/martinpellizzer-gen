It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical flower clusters. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Cyperus frerei is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to various water conditions."
