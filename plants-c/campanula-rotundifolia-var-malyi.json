    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia var. malyi, commonly known as the Malyi bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rounded, lobed leaves and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its charming appearance. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
