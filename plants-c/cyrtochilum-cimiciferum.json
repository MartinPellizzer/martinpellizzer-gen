    "intro": "Cyrtochilum cimiciferum, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is notable for its ability to derive nutrients from other plants, primarily through its specialized roots that form symbiotic relationships with certain host species. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Due to its parasitic nature and specific ecological requirements, it is a rare and delicate species found in humid, shaded environments."
