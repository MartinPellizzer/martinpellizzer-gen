    "intro": "Celtis biondii var. holophylla, commonly known as the white-leaf boxwood, is a variant of the boxwood genus native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, which is typically a pale to white-green color, distinguishing it from other boxwood species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, spherical berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and aesthetic appeal. This variant is relatively low-maintenance and suitable for use in hedges or as a decorative shrub in gardens."
