    "intro": "Cleistes violascens, commonly known as the violet orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, fragrant, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and swampy areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, showy flower per stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
