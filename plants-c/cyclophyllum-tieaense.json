    "intro": "Cyclophyllum tieaense, commonly known as the cyclophyllum or the cyclophyll plant, is a rare and unique species within the family Cycadaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive cyclical leaf structure, which gives it its scientific name. The plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are typically arranged in a spiral pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
