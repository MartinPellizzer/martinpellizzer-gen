    "intro": "Commelina lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Commelinaceae family and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
