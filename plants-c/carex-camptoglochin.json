    "intro": "Carex camptoglochin, commonly known as the bent-sheath sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers. Native to wetland and marshy habitats, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that curve inward, giving it its common name. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
