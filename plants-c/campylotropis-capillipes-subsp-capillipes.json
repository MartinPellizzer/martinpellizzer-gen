    "intro": "Campylotropis capillipes subsp. capillipes, commonly known as the slender cowpea or narrow-leaved cowpea, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of Asia. It features slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with finely serrated margins. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
