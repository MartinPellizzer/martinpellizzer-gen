    "intro": "Cirsium thuretii, commonly known as the Thuret's thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, purple to pinkish-blue flower heads. The plant produces a single, showy flower at the top of the stem, surrounded by bracts that resemble leaves. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped, with serrated edges and a rough texture. Cirsium thuretii is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments."
