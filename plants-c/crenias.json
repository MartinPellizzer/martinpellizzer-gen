    "intro": "Crenias, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, spiny capsule that disperses easily by wind. Crenias is often found in wetlands and disturbed areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
