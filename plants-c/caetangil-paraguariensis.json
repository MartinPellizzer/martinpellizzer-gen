    "intro": "Caetangil paraguariensis, commonly known as yerba mate, is a South American plant native to the Paraguay and Brazil regions. It is a shrub that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its palmate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that contain the seeds, which are used to cultivate new plants. Its leaves are the primary part used, harvested for their stimulant properties due to the presence of caffeine and other alkaloids. The plant thrives in humid, subtropical climates and is often cultivated in shaded environments."
