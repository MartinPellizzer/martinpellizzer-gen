It is a herbaceous perennial characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and distinctive, lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stem is often reddish and covered with fine hairs, while its leaves are broad and have a waxy texture. The flowers bloom in early summer and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local pollinator populations."
