It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly minty leaves that are often used in traditional herbal medicine. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to both ornamental gardens and ecological landscapes."
