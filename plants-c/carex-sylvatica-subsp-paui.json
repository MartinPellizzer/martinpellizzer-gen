    "intro": "Carex sylvatica subsp. paui, commonly known as the mountain sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or alpine environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in its natural habitat."
