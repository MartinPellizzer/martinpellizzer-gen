    "intro": "Cerastium arvense var. webbii, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white, star-like flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread rapidly and form dense mats. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil."
