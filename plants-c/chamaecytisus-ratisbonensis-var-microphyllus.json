    "intro": "Chamaecytisus ratisbonensis var. microphyllus, commonly known as the dwarf rose bush or small-leaved broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, forming a mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant, pink or pale red flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and densely arranged, providing a lush green cover. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
