    "intro": "Cyclopogon paludosus, commonly known as the swamp buttonbush, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in swampy areas, characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, white, button-like flowers. The plant produces small, oval fruits that are often covered in fine hairs. Cyclopogon paludosus is adapted to saturated soil conditions and plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland conservation efforts."
