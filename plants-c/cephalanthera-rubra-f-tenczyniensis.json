    "intro": "Cephalanthera rubra f. tenczyniensis, commonly known as the Tenczynienksy red helleborine, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its dark red to purple flowers with a distinctive yellow-green lip, which is a key botanical feature. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands, preferring rich, humusy soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its unique appearance. Botanically, it is notable for its specialized pollination mechanisms and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest in conservation biology."
