    "intro": "Cynanchum verticillatum var. arenicola, commonly known as sand milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in racemes, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. This species is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer plant in ecological succession."
