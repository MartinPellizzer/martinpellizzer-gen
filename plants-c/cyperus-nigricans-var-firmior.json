    "intro": "Cyperus nigricans var. firmior, commonly known as black flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas, swamps, and along waterways. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, three-ranked flower clusters. Cyperus nigricans var. firmior is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
