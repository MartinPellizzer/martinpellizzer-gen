    "intro": "Cattleya tigrina var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple tigers claw orchid, is a hybrid orchid prized for its striking, vibrant flowers. It features large, velvety petals with a deep purple hue and intricate, tiger-like markings that give it its common name. Native to the tropical regions of South America, this plant thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in clusters with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The flowers typically bloom in late summer or early fall, adding a dramatic display to gardens or indoor collections."
