    "intro": "Capparis uncinata, commonly known as the hooked caper, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, featuring thorny stems and dark green, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, berry-like fruits. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Capparis uncinata is often found in coastal and coastal scrub habitats."
