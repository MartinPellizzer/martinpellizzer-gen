    "intro": "Centella bupleurifolia, commonly known as the Indian pennywort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of southern and eastern Asia. It features a creeping stem with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as a ground cover or used in traditional medicine."
