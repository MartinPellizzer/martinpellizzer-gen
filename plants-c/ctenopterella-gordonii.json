    "intro": "Ctenopterella gordonii, commonly known as the Gordon's sea holly, is a marine plant belonging to the family Cystophoraceae. It is characterized by its unique, branched structure and small, translucent, cup-like structures called cystocysts. This plant typically grows in shallow coastal waters and is often found attached to rocky substrates. Its morphology is adapted to withstand strong tidal forces and wave action. Ctenopterella gordonii plays a role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
