    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 quinquecolor, commonly known as the rainbow orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, multicolored flowers that often display a gradient of pink, red, and purple hues across the petals and sepals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its inflorescence consists of a spike bearing several showy blooms, which can last for several weeks. The species is prized in horticulture for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
