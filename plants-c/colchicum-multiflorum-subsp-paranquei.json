It features striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has basal leaves that are lanceolate and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its corm-like underground stem allows it to survive in dry periods and regrow each season. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
