    "intro": "Cytisus albus var. roseus, commonly known as the white broom or rose-flowered broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets that are usually gray-green in color. This variety is notable for its delicate, rose-like appearance, which sets it apart from the more common Cytisus albus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
