    "intro": "Colchicum autumnale, commonly known as the death cap or autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces red or orange berries that contain toxic compounds. It is often found in woodland areas and meadows, thriving in moist, well-drained soil. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in gardens."
