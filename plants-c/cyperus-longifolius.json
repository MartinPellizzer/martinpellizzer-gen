    "intro": "Cyperus longifolius, commonly known as the tall flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often grouped in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and shallow water areas, and is often used in ornamental landscaping. Cyperus longifolius is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and filter water in aquatic ecosystems."
