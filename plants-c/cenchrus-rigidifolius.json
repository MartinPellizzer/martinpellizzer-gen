    "intro": "Cenchrus rigidifolius, commonly known as rigid leaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its stiff, upright blades and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough texture, while the inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Cenchrus rigidifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in arid conditions."
