It is characterized by its compound leaves and long, pendulous clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cassia polymorpha is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for warm climates."
