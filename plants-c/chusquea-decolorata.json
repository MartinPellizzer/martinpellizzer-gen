It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Bolivia. This plant is characterized by its slender, often reddish stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically lighter in color than those of other Chusquea species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Chusquea decolorata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
