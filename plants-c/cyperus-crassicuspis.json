    "intro": "Cyperus crassicuspis, commonly known as the broad-spike flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, where it thrives in shallow water or saturated soil. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, three-ranked flowers, which are often surrounded by bracts. Cyperus crassicuspis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
