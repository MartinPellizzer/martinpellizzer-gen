    "intro": "Cyclandrophora elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Cyclandrophora elliptica thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is considered a valuable but vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
