    "intro": "Coccothrinax viridescens, commonly known as the green-leafed palm, is a member of the Arecaceae family and is native to the Caribbean islands. It is a small, slender palm that typically grows to a height of about 5 to 8 meters. The plant features a smooth, unbranched stem with a dense crown of elongated, dark green leaves. Its leaves are pinnate, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its coastal habitats. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by edible, coconut-like fruits."
