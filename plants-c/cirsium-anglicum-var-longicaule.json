    "intro": "Cirsium anglicum var. longicaule, commonly known as the longstem thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, supporting a rosette of basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spherical or conical shape known as a \"capitulum.\" Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a rough, serrated edge, contributing to its defensive characteristics against herbivores. This species is often found in dry meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites, where it thrives in full sun."
