It features bright yellow, daisy-like flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant has a bushy growth habit, with short, sturdy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its compact form makes it an attractive addition to native plant gardens and landscapes."
