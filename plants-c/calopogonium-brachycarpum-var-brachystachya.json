It produces small, yellow flowers followed by elliptical pods containing several seeds. The plant is adapted to warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or grasslands. It has a deep root system that helps in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation. This variant is notable for its compact growth habit and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
