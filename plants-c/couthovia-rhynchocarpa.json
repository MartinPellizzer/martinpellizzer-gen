    "intro": "Couthovia rhynchocarpa, commonly known as the horned fruit tree, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fruits that resemble horns, which are typically green when mature and turn reddish-brown upon ripening. The plant has a woody stem with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers are small and clustered, often white or pale yellow, and bloom during the cooler months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Couthovia rhynchocarpa is considered a conservation concern."
