    "intro": "Cerastium arvense var. glabellum, commonly known as the smooth mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as those found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Its growth habit is typically prostrate, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. The plant is often used in ornamental gardening due to its delicate appearance and ability to spread easily."
