    "intro": "Crinum australasicum, commonly known as the Australian crinum, is a flowering plant native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial with strap-like leaves and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help the plant survive in dry conditions. Crinum australasicum is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or rocky soils."
