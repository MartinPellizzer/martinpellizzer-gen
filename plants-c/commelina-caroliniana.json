It features striking blue-violet flowers that bloom from spring to summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has heart-shaped, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments, typically found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it a common sight in wetland habitats."
