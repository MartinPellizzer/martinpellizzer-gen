    "intro": "Cyclosorus farinosus, commonly known as the sticky cyclosorus, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant produces sporangia that are covered in a sticky substance, which aids in spore dispersal. It is a cryptogamic plant, meaning it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Cyclosorus farinosus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
