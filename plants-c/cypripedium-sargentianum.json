    "intro": "Cypripedium sargentianum, commonly known as Sargent's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch and a prominent lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires specific soil conditions to thrive. Its botanical features include a sympodial growth habit and a complex arrangement of petals and sepals. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas."
