    "intro": "Clidemia flexuosa, commonly known as the waterfall plant or creeping waxplant, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink in color, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a nuisance in certain ecosystems."
