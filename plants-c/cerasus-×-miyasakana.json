It belongs to the Prunus genus and is characterized by its ornamental value, particularly its showy pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and has alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its fruit, a small cherry-like drupe, is edible but less commonly cultivated for consumption compared to other cherry species.
