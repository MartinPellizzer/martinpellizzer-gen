    "intro": "Cardamine amara var. petiolulata, commonly known as the slender watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically borne on petioles, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its leaves are often used in culinary applications, though they are more delicate than those of the common watercress."
