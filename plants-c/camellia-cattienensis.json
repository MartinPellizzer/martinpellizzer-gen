    "intro": "Camellia cattienensis, commonly known as the Tien Shan camellia, is a flowering plant native to the Tien Shan mountain range in Central Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves and showy, camellia-like flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant red or pink flowers, which add color to gardens in cooler climates. Camellia cattienensis is a species of interest for botanists and horticulturists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
