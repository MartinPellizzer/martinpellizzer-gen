    "intro": "Conyza floresiana, commonly known as the Florida ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an annual herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and swamps. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Conyza floresiana plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes found in disturbed soils near water bodies."
