    "intro": "Coccoceras borneense, commonly known as the Bornean coccolith, is a unique marine alga belonging to the class Chlorophyceae. It is characterized by its distinctive spherical shape and the presence of calcified plates called coccoliths, which are arranged in a complex pattern. This organism is typically found in shallow coastal waters and estuaries, where it plays a role in primary productivity. Its life cycle includes both asexual and sexual reproduction, contributing to its ecological significance in marine ecosystems. The plant's structure and composition make it an important subject for studies in marine botany and paleontology."
