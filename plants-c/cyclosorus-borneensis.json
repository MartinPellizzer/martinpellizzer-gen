    "intro": "Cyclosorus borneensis, commonly known as the Borneo cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern native to the freshwater habitats of Borneo. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often anchored to submerged substrates. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive system, with sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of its leaves. Its morphology includes a short, creeping rhizome and small, lanceolate leaflets. Due to habitat destruction, Cyclosorus borneensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical research."
