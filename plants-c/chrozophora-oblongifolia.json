    "intro": "Chrozophora oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf sunflower, is a herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that are similar in appearance to those of the common sunflower, though smaller in size. Its flowering period typically occurs in the summer months, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Chrozophora oblongifolia is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
