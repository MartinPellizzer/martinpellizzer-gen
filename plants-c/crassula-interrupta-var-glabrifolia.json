    "intro": "Crassula interrupta var. glabrifolia, commonly known as the Woolly Crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is a low-growing species, often forming dense mats or clumps. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is popular among succulent enthusiasts and gardeners in dry climates."
