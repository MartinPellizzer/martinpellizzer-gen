    "intro": "Cereus cupulatus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to the deserts of South America. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and nocturnal blooming habit. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night and remain open for only one night. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. The flowers are pollinated primarily by moths and bats, which are active during the night."
