    "intro": "Chamaexeros serra, commonly known as the mountain chamaexeros, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Peru. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Chamaexeros serra produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
