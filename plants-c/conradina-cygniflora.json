It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to coastal and xeric environments. Its leaves are silver-gray in color, providing a striking contrast to its bright yellow and orange flowers. Conradina cygniflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
