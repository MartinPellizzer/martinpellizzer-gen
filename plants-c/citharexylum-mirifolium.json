    "intro": "Citharexylum mirifolium, commonly known as the fragrant mistletoe, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a hemiparasitic shrub that attaches to the branches of its host trees, drawing water and nutrients while producing its own food through photosynthesis. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its ecological role and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
