    "intro": "Cheilanthes rigidula, commonly known as the rigid lady's tresses, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces intricate, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brown spore cases, which are typically found on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as cliffs and slopes. Cheilanthes rigidula is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that is well adapted to arid environments."
