    "intro": "Calamagrostis villosa subvar. convolutiva, commonly known as silvergrass or velvet grass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It features slender, arching stems that produce panicles of pale green to silver-blue florets, giving it a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant has soft, hairy leaves that contribute to its silvery sheen, and it thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. It is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas. Its growth habit and aesthetic qualities make it a popular choice for ecological restoration and ornamental gardens."
