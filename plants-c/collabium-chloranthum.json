    "intro": "Collabium chloranthum, commonly known as the green-flowered bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Collabium chloranthum is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations."
