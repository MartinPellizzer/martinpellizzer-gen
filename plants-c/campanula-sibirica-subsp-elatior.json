    "intro": "Campanula sibirica subsp. elatior, commonly known as the tall bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
