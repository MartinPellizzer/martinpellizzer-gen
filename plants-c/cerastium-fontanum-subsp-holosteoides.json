    "intro": "Cerastium fontanum subsp. holosteoides, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense rosette of small, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler climates."
