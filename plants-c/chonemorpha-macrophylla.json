    "intro": "Chonemorpha macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant's flowers are showy, typically white or pink, and bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its roots anchor in the muddy bottom of slow-moving waters, while its stems form a dense network beneath the water. The leaves have a waxy surface that prevents water from penetrating, allowing them to remain buoyant and support the weight of the plant."
