    "intro": "Cyclophorus transmorrisonensis, commonly known as the Morrison's cyclophorus, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth margin and a slight pubescence, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
