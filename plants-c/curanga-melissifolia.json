    "intro": "Curanga melissifolia, commonly known as the honeyleaf tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, heart-shaped leaves that emit a sweet, honey-like scent, especially when crushed. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Curanga melissifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
