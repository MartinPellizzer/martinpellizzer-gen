It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its flowers are often pink or purple and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.
