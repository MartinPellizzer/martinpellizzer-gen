    "intro": "Crossolepis brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved crossolepis, is a small shrub native to the dry forests of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Crossolepis brevifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate drought conditions."
