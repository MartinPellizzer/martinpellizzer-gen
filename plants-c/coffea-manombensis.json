    "intro": "Coffea manombensis, commonly known as the Manombensis coffee, is a species native to Madagascar. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in the understory of tropical rainforests. The plant produces small, oval-shaped berries that contain two seeds, which are used to make coffee. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
