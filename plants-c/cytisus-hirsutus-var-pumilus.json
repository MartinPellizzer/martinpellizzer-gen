    "intro": "Cytisus hirsutus var. pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf yellow broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features slender, arching stems covered in dense, yellowish-green foliage. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
