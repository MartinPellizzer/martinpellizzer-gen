    "intro": "Cyperus pes-avium, commonly known as the cattle pasture sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas or along waterways. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or brown, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Cyperus pes-avium is also valued for its ornamental appeal in landscaping and wetland gardens."
