    "intro": "Crataegus holmesiana var. tardipes, commonly known as the late-flowering hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to elliptic leaves, and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom later in the growing season compared to other hawthorn species. The fruit is a small, red to orange pome that ripens in the fall, providing food for birds and small mammals. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
