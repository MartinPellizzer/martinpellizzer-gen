    "intro": "Caryophyllus deplanchei, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to white, often with a striking red throat. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Caryophyllus deplanchei is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
