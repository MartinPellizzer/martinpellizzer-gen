    "intro": "Centaurea splendens var. feichtingeri, commonly known as the Feichtinger's star-thistle, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats like grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with a distinctive blue-gray coloration. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
