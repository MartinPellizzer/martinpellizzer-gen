It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and along roadsides. It has a robust root system that allows it to survive in harsh environmental conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in some regions but also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
