    "intro": "Cornopteris sulcinervia, commonly known as the smooth-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it establish in various soil types. The fronds have a distinctive smooth, almost silky texture along the veins, giving it its common name."
