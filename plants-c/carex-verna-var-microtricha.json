    "intro": "Carex verna var. microtricha, commonly known as the slender marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and moist forest environments. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with three-ranked leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in shallow water or damp soil, often found in bogs, swamps, and along stream banks. Its narrow, grass-like leaves and delicate flowers make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
