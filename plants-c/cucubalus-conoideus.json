    "intro": "Cucubalus conoideus, commonly known as the conical cucumber, is a tropical climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, conical fruits resembling miniature cucumbers. Its botanical features make it suitable for ornamental use in gardens and greenhouses. The fruit is edible when young but becomes fibrous and less palatable as it matures."
