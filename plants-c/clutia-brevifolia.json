    "intro": "Clutia brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved clutia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an herb or shrub, with simple, opposite leaves that are usually ovate or elliptical in shape. Clutia brevifolia produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its medicinal properties have been traditionally used in various folk remedies, though scientific validation is limited."
