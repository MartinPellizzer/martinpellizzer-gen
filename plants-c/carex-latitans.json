    "intro": "Carex latitans, commonly known as the creeping sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an effective plant for erosion control. Carex latitans is also valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
