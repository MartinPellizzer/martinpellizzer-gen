    "intro": "Cymbopogon obtectus, commonly known as the narrow grass or narrow leaved citron grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often aromatic. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along riverbanks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. Cymbopogon obtectus is sometimes used in traditional medicine and may have potential applications in horticulture or ecological restoration."
