    "intro": "Cereus candelaris, commonly known as the candlestick cactus, is a species native to the deserts of South America. It is a tall, columnar cactus with a smooth, green stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of white, tubular flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its stems are covered in small, spiny areoles, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stem for survival in arid conditions. Cereus candelaris is well adapted to hot, dry environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
