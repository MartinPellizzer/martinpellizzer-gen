    "intro": "Culcita macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its large, umbrella-like compound leaves and showy white flowers. It is native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia but has been introduced to North America, where it has become an invasive species. The plant can grow up to 5 meters tall, with thick, hairy stems that exude a phototoxic sap when damaged. Its flowers are arranged in complex inflorescences and are pollinated by insects, while its seeds are dispersed by wind. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it a significant ecological concern."
