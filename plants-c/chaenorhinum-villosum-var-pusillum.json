    "intro": "Chaenorhinum villosum var. pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf hairy horned poppy, is a herbaceous annual plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, branched stems covered in fine, hairy texture, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, hairy surface. The plant produces striking, bright orange to red flowers with five petals and a distinctive horn-like structure at the base. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is occasionally grown in gardens."
