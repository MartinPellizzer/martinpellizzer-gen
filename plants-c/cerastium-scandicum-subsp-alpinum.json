    "intro": "Cerastium scandicum subsp. alpinum, commonly known as alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy, kidney-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to cold climates and high altitudes."
