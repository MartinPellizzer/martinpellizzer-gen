It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces bright yellow, daisy-like flowers with ray florets that bloom in early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact size and long bloom period make it an excellent addition to native plant gardens."
