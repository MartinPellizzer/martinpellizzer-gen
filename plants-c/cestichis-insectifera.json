    "intro": "Cestichis insectifera, commonly known as the insect-bearing cestichis, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition. It possesses modified leaves that function as traps, capturing small insects to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils. The plant's structure resembles that of a fern, with delicate, feather-like fronds that aid in photosynthesis while also serving as a habitat for its prey. Its reproductive system involves the production of spores, which are dispersed by wind to ensure propagation in suitable environments. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is often found in isolated, humid regions with high biodiversity."
