It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in its native habitat.
