    "intro": "Carex limosa subsp. subalpina, commonly known as the subalpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous areas, often found in meadows, rocky slopes, and stream banks. The plant has grass-like leaves that are generally narrow and grass-green, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, wind-pollinated flowers, and it produces triangular, three-sided seed capsules. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
