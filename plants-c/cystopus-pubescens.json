    "intro": "Cystopus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, inflated bladders that aid in capturing prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the bladders are its primary means of nutrient acquisition. Cystopus pubescens is a carnivorous plant that uses its specialized bladders to trap and digest small aquatic organisms."
