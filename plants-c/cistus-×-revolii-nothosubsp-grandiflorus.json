    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 revolii nothosubsp. grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered rockrose, is a hybrid shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and showy, pale yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
