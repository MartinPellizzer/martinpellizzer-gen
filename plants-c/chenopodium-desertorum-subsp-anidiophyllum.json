    "intro": "Chenopodium desertorum subsp. anidiophyllum, commonly known as desert goosefoot, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It typically has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with minimal water availability. This subspecies is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in desert ecosystems."
