    "intro": "Circaea \u00d7 intermedia f. bracteolata, commonly known as the bracteolate wood sorrel, is a hybrid plant species within the Primulaceae family. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, leaf-like bracts beneath the flowers. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
