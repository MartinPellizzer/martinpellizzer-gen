    "intro": "Clematis aristata var. browniana, commonly known as the Brown's Clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 20 feet, making it an excellent choice for vertical gardening. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets that are often hairy beneath. This variety is relatively hardy and thrives in full sun to partial shade, preferring well-drained soil."
