    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nauseosus var. albicaulis, commonly known as whiteleaf goldenbush, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and yellow flower clusters that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat."
