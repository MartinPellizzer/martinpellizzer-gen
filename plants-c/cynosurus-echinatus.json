    "intro": "Cynosurus echinatus, commonly known as the hairy fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. Cynosurus echinatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
