    "intro": "Cistus immaculatum, commonly known as the white rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula and northern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cistus immaculatum is also known for its aromatic foliage and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
