    "intro": "Callista aemula, commonly known as the pink fairy tern, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual that grows close to the ground, often in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is adapted to withstand coastal conditions such as salt spray and strong winds. Callista aemula plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
