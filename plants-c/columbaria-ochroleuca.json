    "intro": "Columbaria ochroleuca, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils, often in desert or semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by woolly, spherical seed heads. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Columbaria ochroleuca is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal."
