    "intro": "Cotoneaster vestitus, commonly known as the hairy cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including dry and rocky conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries that are a food source for birds. Cotoneaster vestitus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to form thickets, making it suitable for erosion control. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, somewhat fuzzy appearance."
