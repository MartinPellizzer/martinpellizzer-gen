    "intro": "Caroxylon albisepalum, commonly known as the white-sepal caroxylon, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring white sepals that contrast sharply with its green foliage. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate moisture and indirect light. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture and a subtle aromatic scent. Despite its ornamental appeal, Caroxylon albisepalum is critically endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection."
