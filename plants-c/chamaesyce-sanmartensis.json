    "intro": "Chamaesyce sanmartensis, commonly known as San Mart\u00edn's sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant typically forms dense mats close to the ground, with small, pale green or yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, providing additional protection against desiccation. This species is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a common sight in coastal and desert landscapes."
