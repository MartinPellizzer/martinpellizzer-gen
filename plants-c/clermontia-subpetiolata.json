    "intro": "Clermontia subpetiolata, commonly known as the Mauna Kea fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the high elevations of Hawaii. It is a member of the fern family and is characterized by its delicate, biennial habit with a short, thick rhizome. The plant produces a single, upright, leafy shoot that bears a cluster of small, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, humid climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
