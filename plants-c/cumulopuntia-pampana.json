    "intro": "Cumulopuntia pampana, commonly known as the Pampas cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer seasons, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Its growth habit is typically solitary or in small clusters, and it is well-suited to rocky or sandy soils. Cumulopuntia pampana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with suitable climates."
