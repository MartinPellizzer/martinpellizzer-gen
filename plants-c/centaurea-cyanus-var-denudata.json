    "intro": "Centaurea cyanus var. denudata, commonly known as the common blueweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which are typically arranged in dense, showy clusters. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a source of nectar for pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
