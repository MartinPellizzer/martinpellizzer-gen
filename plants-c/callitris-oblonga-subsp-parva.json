    "intro": "Callitris oblonga subsp. parva, commonly known as the small-leaf white cypress, is a small to medium-sized evergreen conifer native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, cylindrical trunk and dense, scale-like foliage that forms a compact, rounded crown. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. This subspecies is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh environments."
