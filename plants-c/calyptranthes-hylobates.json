It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that have a silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
