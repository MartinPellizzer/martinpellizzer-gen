    "intro": "Crepis altaica, commonly known as the high mountain mouse-ear, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and small, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in composite inflorescences, which are typical of the daisy family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine environments. Crepis altaica is adapted to cold climates and is often found in meadows and slopes above the tree line."
