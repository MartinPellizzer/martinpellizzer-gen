It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its striking, bright red or orange flowers that appear in clusters during the late summer to early autumn. The leaves are small, oval-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract birds and insects."
