    "intro": "Cissus ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty ippis, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a rusty-colored pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its stems are woody and can form dense thickets, making it a common sight in humid, shaded environments. Cissus ferruginea is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued as an ornamental plant."
