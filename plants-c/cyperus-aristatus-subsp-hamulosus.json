    "intro": "Cyperus aristatus subsp. hamulosus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, wetlands, and along waterways. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
