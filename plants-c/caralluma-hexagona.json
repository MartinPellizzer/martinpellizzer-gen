    "intro": "Caralluma hexagona, commonly known as the stonecress or desert cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are typically green or reddish in color, adapted to store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range from yellow to orange, often blooming in the morning. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Caralluma hexagona is also valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional remedies."
