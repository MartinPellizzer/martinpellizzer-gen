    "intro": "Coelogyne hitendrae, commonly known as the Hitendra's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern India. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and red, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its tropical habitat. Due to its beauty and rarity, Coelogyne hitendrae is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
