    "intro": "Cranichis callejasii, commonly known as the Mexican fairy slipper, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that resemble tiny slippers, typically in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
