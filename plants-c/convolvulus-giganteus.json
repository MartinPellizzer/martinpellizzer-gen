    "intro": "Convolvulus giganteus, commonly known as the giant morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to South America. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces large, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to cover structures make it both ornamental and invasive in some regions. The flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name."
