    "intro": "Cyclosorus clemensiae, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, lobed leaves that form a dense, carpet-like mat on the water surface. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves. Cyclosorus clemensiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
