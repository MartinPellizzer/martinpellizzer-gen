    "intro": "Caladium lemaireanum, commonly known as the red-veined caladium, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with deep red veins against a lush green background. The plant belongs to the Araceae family and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Caladium lemaireanum is typically grown as an annual in temperate climates but can be perennial in its native tropical habitat."
