    "intro": "Carpesium cordatum, commonly known as heartleaf cudweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features basal leaves that are cordate, or heart-shaped, and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its flowering stems are usually branched and covered in fine, white hairs. Carpesium cordatum is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator species for wetland environments."
