    "intro": "Cytinus dioicus, commonly known as the Egyptian bean or the parasitic borage, is a flowering plant in the family Boraginaceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant is characterized by its striking red or purple flowers, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant's unique life cycle involves a short above-ground growth phase followed by the production of a large, fleshy fruit that contains numerous seeds."
