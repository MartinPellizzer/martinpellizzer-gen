It features striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has distinctive, reflexed petals and a spadix-like structure that houses its reproductive organs. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and emerge after the flowers have faded. Colchicum orientale is also known for containing colchicine, a compound with medicinal and toxic properties."
