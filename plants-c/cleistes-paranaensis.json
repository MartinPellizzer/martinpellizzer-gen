    "intro": "Cleistes paranaensis, commonly known as the Parana orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its unique, bilaterally symmetrical flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments and produces small, fragrant blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
