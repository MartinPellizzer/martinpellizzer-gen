    "intro": "Carex pseudofoetida, commonly known as the skunk sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Native to the northeastern United States, it thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant is often mistaken for other sedges due to its similar appearance, but it can be distinguished by its distinctive, slightly aromatic leaves. It plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
