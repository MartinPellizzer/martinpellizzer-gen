    "intro": "Cactus spinaureus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its spherical shape and bright yellow spines that give it its common name. The plant has a thick, water-storing stem that helps it survive in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and bloom during the rainy season. The cactus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
