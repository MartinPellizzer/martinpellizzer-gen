    "intro": "Chirita secundiflora, commonly known as the clustered pipsissewa, is a low-growing evergreen perennial herb native to the Appalachian region of the United States. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and herbal practices."
