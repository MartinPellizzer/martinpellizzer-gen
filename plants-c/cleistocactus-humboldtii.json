    "intro": "Cleistocactus humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt's close-cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a small, globular cactus with a thick, ribbed stem that stores water efficiently. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom at night, a unique adaptation to its desert environment. Its spines are short and dense, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss. Cleistocactus humboldtii is well-suited to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
