    "intro": "Canarium tonkinense, commonly known as the Tonkin candlenut, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its latex, similar to that of other Canarium species, is used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in lowland tropical forests."
