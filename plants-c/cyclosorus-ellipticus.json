    "intro": "Cyclosorus ellipticus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Asia. It has delicate, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern around its stem. The plant produces tiny, floating flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in slow-moving or still water with moderate light exposure. Cyclosorus ellipticus is often used in aquariums due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life."
