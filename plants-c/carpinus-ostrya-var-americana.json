    "intro": "Carpinus ostrya var. americana, commonly known as the American hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and alternate, ovate leaves with doubly serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits that disperse by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. The American hornbeam is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
