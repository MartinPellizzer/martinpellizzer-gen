    "intro": "Cocculus amazonum, commonly known as the Amazon morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces a distinctive, spherical fruit that turns from green to yellow as it matures. Its seeds are enclosed within a thick, fibrous coating, which aids in their dispersal. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, Cocculus amazonum is often cultivated in gardens and natural habitats alike."
