    "intro": "Cheilanthes nitida, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows on rocky outcrops and in crevices, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Cheilanthes nitida is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
