    "intro": "Cheilanthopsis elongata, commonly known as the long-stalked rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-shaped fronds that often grow in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically on tree trunks or rocks. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Cheilanthopsis elongata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
