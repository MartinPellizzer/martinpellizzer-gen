It features upright, branched stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, adorned with narrow, gray-green leaves that are softly hairy. The plant produces dense, spherical flower heads composed of numerous small, violet-blue flowers surrounded by white to pale blue bracts. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, and it is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
