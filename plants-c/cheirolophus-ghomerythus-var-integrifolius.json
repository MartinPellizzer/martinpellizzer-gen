    "intro": "Cheirolophus ghomerythus var. integrifolius, commonly known as the African dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid conditions. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in drought-prone environments. The leaves are typically hairless and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss."
