    "intro": "Caralluma decaisneana subsp. hesperidum, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South Africa. It features fleshy, spiny stems that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are usually reduced to small spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration. This subspecies is valued for its resilience and unique appearance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
