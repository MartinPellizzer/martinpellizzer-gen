    "intro": "Cyanostegia turczaninovii var. dentata, commonly known as the serrated bluestem, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that often display a bluish-gray hue due to the presence of dense, glandular hairs. The leaves are narrow and linear, with serrated margins that give the plant its specific epithet \"dentata.\" It produces small, white or pale blue flowers in loose, racemose inflorescences, typically blooming in the summer months. This plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
