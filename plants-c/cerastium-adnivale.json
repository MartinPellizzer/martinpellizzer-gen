    "intro": "Cerastium adnivale, commonly known as snowberry or white dead-nettle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are often covered in a fine, white bloom, giving it a frost-like appearance. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Cerastium adnivale is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
