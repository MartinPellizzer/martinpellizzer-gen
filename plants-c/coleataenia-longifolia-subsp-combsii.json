    "intro": "Coleataenia longifolia subsp. combsii, commonly known as the Combs' longleaf coleataenia, is a rare and distinctive plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that can reach several centimeters in length, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
