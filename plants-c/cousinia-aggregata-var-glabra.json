    "intro": "Cousinia aggregata var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically grayish-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Cousinia aggregata var. glabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
