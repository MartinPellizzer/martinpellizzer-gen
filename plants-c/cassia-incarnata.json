    "intro": "Cassia incarnata, commonly known as the eastern candlewood or false flame bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that appear in clusters, resembling candles, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. Cassia incarnata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
