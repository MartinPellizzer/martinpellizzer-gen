    "intro": "Cleisostoma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orchidaceae. These plants are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Cleisostoma species are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often have a unique, ghostly appearance. They are native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. Due to their rarity and specific habitat requirements, Cleisostoma species are often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests."
