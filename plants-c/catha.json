    "intro": "Catha, commonly known as khat, is a flowering plant native to the Arabian Peninsula and East Africa. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and oval-shaped leaves that are often harvested for their stimulant properties. The leaves contain cathinone and cathine, which are alkaloids responsible for the plant's psychoactive effects. Due to its stimulating properties, Catha has been used traditionally in social and cultural settings across its native regions."
