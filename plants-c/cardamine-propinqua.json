It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. The plant features trifoliate leaves with finely divided lobes and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. Its root system is rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Cardamine propinqua is often found in temperate regions of North America and is noted for its delicate appearance and ecological importance in aquatic and riparian habitats."
