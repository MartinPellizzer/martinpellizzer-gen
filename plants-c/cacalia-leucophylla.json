    "intro": "Cacalia leucophylla, commonly known as the white-leaf bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are broad and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Cacalia leucophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
