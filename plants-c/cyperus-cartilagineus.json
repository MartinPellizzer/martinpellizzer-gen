It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Cyperus cartilagineus thrives in wet or marshy habitats, often found in coastal areas or near water bodies. Its ability to tolerate saline conditions makes it an important species in certain ecological contexts."
