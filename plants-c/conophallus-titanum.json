It is a member of the Phallaceae family, known for its distinctive, phallic-shaped fruiting bodies. The fungus thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on decaying wood or soil. Its structure consists of a tall, spiny stalk topped with a bulbous, pustule-like cap that releases spores. Due to its rare occurrence and peculiar appearance, it is a subject of interest in mycology and botanical research."
