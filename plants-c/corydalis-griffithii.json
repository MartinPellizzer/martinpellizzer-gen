    "intro": "Corydalis griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces a unique type of seed pod that splits open to release its seeds, a feature common in the genus Corydalis. It prefers well-drained, moist soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
