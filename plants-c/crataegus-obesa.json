    "intro": "Crataegus obesa, commonly known as the fat hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, rounded branches and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red, fleshy fruits known as pomes, which are typically eaten by birds and small mammals. Crataegus obesa has small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of native ecosystems and a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
