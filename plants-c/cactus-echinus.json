    "intro": "Cactus echinus, commonly known as the spiny hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its root system is shallow and adapted to quickly absorb moisture after rare rainfalls. The cactus echinus is also valued for its ability to provide habitat and food for various desert wildlife."
