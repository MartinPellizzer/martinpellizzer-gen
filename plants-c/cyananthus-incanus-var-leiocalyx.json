    "intro": "Cyananthus incanus var. leiocalyx, commonly known as the white-flowered cyananthus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, and has hairy stems and leaves. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine pubescence, while the flowers are clustered in umbels. This variant is distinguished by its pale blue to white petals, which contrast with its green foliage."
