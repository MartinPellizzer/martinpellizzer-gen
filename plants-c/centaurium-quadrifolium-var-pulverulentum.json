    "intro": "Centaurium quadrifolium var. pulverulentum, commonly known as the powdered centaury, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. Its leaves are usually opposite and often have a finely hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare species of conservation concern."
