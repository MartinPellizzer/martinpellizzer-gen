    "intro": "Corydalis amarnathiana, commonly known as the Amarnath Corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant features a slender, upright stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral morphology, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
