    "intro": "Ctenitis grisebachii, commonly known as the gray fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form dense, floating mats on water surfaces. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating the spread of new growth. Ctenitis grisebachii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in aquatic ecosystems."
