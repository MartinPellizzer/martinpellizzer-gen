    "intro": "Carex stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping sedgeland, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like inflorescences. The plant spreads via stolons, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. It thrives in wet to moist environments, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit makes it an effective plant for stabilizing wetland soils."
