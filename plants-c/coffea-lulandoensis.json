    "intro": "Coffea lulandoensis, commonly known as the Lulando coffee. It is a rare and lesser-known species of coffee native to the highlands of Tanzania. This plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and produces red, fleshy berries containing two seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and low yields, it is not widely cultivated or commercially available."
