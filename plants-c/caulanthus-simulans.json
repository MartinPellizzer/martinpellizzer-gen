    "intro": "Caulanthus simulans, commonly known as the mimic's broomrape, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant that derives nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and it is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
