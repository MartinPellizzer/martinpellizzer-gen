    "intro": "Crepis staticifolia, commonly known as the sticky hairgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, sticky hairs, which give it its common name. Crepis staticifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
