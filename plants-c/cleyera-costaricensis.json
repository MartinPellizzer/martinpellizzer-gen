    "intro": "Cleyera costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican cleyera, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to Central America, particularly Costa Rica and Panama, where it typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, and it bears dark, glossy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Cleyera costaricensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens. Its botanical characteristics reflect adaptations to the humid, tropical conditions of its native habitat."
