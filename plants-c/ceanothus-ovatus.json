    "intro": "Ceanothus ovatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf ceanothus, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, blue-gray foliage and clusters of violet to blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ceanothus ovatus is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
