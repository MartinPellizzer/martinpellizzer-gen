It is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salt spray. It has small, bean-like pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
