    "intro": "Cyperus ferax var. densiflorus, commonly known as the denseflower flatsedge, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. It typically grows in wetland environments, including marshes and shallow water bodies, where it thrives in saturated soils. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown, and it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This variant is distinguished by its more compact floral arrangement compared to other Cyperus species."
