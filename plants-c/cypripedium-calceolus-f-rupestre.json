    "intro": "Cypripedium calceolus f. rupestre, commonly known as the alpine lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, fragrant, and showy flowers that resemble a cluster of small, pinkish-white petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a dense rosette, and it produces a single spike of flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variety is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
