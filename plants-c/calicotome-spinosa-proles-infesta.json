    "intro": "Calicotome spinosa proles infesta, commonly known as the Portuguese thorn or Portuguese acacia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Portugal and northern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing small, hard seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system. Its botanical features make it well-suited for coastal and semi-arid environments."
