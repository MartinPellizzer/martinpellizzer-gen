    "intro": "Carex elata subsp. omskiana, commonly known as the tall sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Eurasia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. It produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown to greenish flowers in the summer, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments."
