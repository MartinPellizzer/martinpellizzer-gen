    "intro": "Carex bigelowii subsp. hyperborea, commonly known as the Arctic sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments, often found in tundra and rocky soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic organisms."
