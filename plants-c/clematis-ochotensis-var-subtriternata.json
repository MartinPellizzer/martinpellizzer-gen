It features climbing stems with prominent, palmately compound leaves that are trifoliate or subtrifoliate in structure. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sun. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
