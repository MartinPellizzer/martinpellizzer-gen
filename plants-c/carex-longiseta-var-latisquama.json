    "intro": "Carex longiseta var. latisquama, commonly known as the broad-sheath sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, strap-shaped leaves that are broader than the typical sedge species. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life."
