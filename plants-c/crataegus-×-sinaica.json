It is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in areas such as the Sinai Peninsula. The plant is characterized by its small, thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, red berries in the autumn. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
