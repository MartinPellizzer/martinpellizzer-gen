    "intro": "Cyperus sanguineoater var. floribundus, commonly known as the red swamp cyperus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often forming dense clusters. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne in clusters at the top of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more pronounced under full sun. This species is often found in marshy areas, pond margins, and along the edges of water bodies, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
