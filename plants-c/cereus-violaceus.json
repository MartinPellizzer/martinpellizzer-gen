    "intro": "Cereus violaceus, commonly known as the violet night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and striking violet flowers that bloom at night. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert conditions. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening only for a few hours before closing again. The plant's ability to store water in its fleshy stems allows it to survive in harsh, dry climates."
