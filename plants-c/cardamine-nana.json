    "intro": "Cardamine nana, commonly known as small fern or dwarf watercress, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length, with a smooth, glossy surface. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and arranged in a raceme, producing tiny, edible seeds. Cardamine nana is often used in herbal medicine and is also a popular plant for water gardens and wetland restoration projects."
