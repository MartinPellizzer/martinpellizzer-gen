It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically pale green to blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are usually green to brown in color. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Carex setifolia var. pungens is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
