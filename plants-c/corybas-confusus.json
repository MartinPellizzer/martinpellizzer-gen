    "intro": "Corybas confusus, commonly known as the confused helmet orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to New Zealand. It is a terrestrial herb with a distinctive, hood-like flower that resembles a helmet, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a prominent central spur, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Corybas confusus is known for its unique morphology and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi."
