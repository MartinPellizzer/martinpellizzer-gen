    "intro": "Cypripedium calceolus f. grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaved ladyslipper, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or white in color. The plant features broad, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention in its often harsh habitats. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and mountainous regions. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected in many areas and is a subject of conservation efforts."
