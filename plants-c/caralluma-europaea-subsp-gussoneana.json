    "intro": "Caralluma europaea subsp. gussoneana, commonly known as the European horned cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a feature typical of many cacti adapted to drought. This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
