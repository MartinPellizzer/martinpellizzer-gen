    "intro": "Chondrosum simplex, commonly known as the simple cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically succulent and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Chondrosum simplex is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
