    "intro": "Calamus pholidostachys, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed calamus, is a member of the Aroid family (Araceae). It is characterized by its tall, slender rhizomes and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense, fibrous sheath. The plant produces an inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of many Aroid species. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including parts of India and Indonesia. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated for horticultural purposes."
