It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters such as ponds, lakes, and streams. The plant has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces small, white flowers that are often submerged or floating at the water's surface. This subspecies is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, still or gently flowing water."
