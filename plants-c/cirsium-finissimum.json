It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this species thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with rough, serrated edges, and the plant produces small, bract-like leaves around the flower heads. Cirsium finissimum is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, arid environments."
