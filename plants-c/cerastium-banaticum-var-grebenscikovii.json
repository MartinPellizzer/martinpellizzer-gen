    "intro": "Cerastium banaticum var. grebenscikovii, commonly known as the Greben\u0161\u010dikov's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
