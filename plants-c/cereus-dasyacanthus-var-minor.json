    "intro": "Cereus dasyacanthus var. minor, commonly known as the miniature night blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers at night, which open in response to cooler temperatures and darkness. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking appearance and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
