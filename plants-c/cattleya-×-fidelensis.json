It is characterized by its large, fragrant, and showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shady environments. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, often with a waxy texture, and it requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture. Cattleya \u00d7 fidelensis is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ease of cultivation."
