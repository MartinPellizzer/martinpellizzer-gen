    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum gongshanense, commonly known as the Gongshan orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province, China. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and striking coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on specific mycorrhizal relationships for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are notable for their intricate petal patterns and vibrant hues, which contribute to its ecological and ornamental significance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
