    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 aurantium var. asperma, commonly known as the rough lemon, is a citrus hybrid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, rough, and often thorned rind, which distinguishes it from other citrus species. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers. Its fruit is generally not eaten fresh but is used in the production of essential oils and as a source of citric acid. The rough lemon is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and its role in breeding programs for other citrus varieties."
