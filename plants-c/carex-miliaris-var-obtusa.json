It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with broad, flat leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are clustered in a loose, cylindrical inflorescence. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.
