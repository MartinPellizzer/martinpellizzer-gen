    "intro": "Caragana hamiensis, commonly known as the Hami caragana, is a shrub native to Central Asia, particularly found in Xinjiang, China. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the branches. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resistance to drought and poor soil conditions. Caragana hamiensis is often used for windbreaks and soil stabilization in its native habitat."
