    "intro": "Cohniella, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its unique, small, and often delicate inflorescences that resemble clusters of tiny white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in woodland areas. Its leaves are usually pinnately divided, and the stems are often hollow. Cohniella species are of interest to botanists due to their unusual morphology and ecological adaptations."
