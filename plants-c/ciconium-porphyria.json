    "intro": "Ciconium porphyria, commonly known as the purple ciconium, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking purple-pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from poor, rocky soils. Ciconium porphyria is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
