    "intro": "Cleyera japonica var. hayatae, commonly known as Japanese holly, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan and parts of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant."
