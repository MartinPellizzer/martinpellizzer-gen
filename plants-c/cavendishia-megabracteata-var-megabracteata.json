    "intro": "Cavendishia megabracteata var. megabracteata, commonly known as the giant bract cactus, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, fleshy stems that can grow up to several meters in height, often branching out into a tree-like structure. The plant produces showy, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. The plant's unique morphology and adaptability make it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and botanical gardens."
