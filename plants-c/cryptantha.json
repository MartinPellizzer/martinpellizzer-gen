    "intro": "Cryptantha, commonly known as the \"blue flax\" or \"bitterroot,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to North America and are characterized by their small, often blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring. Cryptantha species typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. They have small, hairy leaves and produce pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Some species are used in traditional medicine, while others are valued for their ornamental appeal."
