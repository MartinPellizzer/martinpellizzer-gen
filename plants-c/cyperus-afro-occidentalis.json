It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and pond margins, and has narrow, linear leaves. Its flowering spikes are usually unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate spikes, a feature common in many sedges. Cyperus afro-occidentalis is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive, feathery appearance."
