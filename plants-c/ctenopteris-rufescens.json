    "intro": "Ctenopteris rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed sea palm, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, compound fronds that are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near coastal areas or in humid forests. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with a reddish hue on the underside, giving it its common name. Ctenopteris rufescens is valued for its ability to tolerate salt spray, making it suitable for coastal landscaping."
