    "intro": "Cattleya labiata var. petersii, commonly known as the Peters' Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid prized for its vibrant, fragrant flowers. It features large, showy blooms with a distinctive lip that is often a different color from the rest of the flower. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on trees rather than in soil, and thrives in warm, humid environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relative ease of cultivation."
