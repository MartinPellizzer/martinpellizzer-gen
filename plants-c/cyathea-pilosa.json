    "intro": "Cyathea pilosa, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive hairy texture on its trunk, which gives it its common name. Cyathea pilosa typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
