    "intro": "Callitriche platycarpa f. minor, commonly known as the narrow-fruit water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, branching stems that often float on the water surface, with small, oval-shaped leaves arranged in whorls. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and are borne in clusters at the nodes along the stems. This subspecies is distinguished by its narrower fruits compared to the typical form, which contributes to its unique ecological niche."
