    "intro": "Crossangis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant lacks leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to grow on trees. Its unique appearance and limited habitat make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern. Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it is listed as endangered in several states."
