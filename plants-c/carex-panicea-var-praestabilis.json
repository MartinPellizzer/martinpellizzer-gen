    "intro": "Carex panicea var. praestabilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that are often tinged with reddish hues. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, making it a common sight in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
