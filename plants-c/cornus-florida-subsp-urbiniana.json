It is characterized by its showy, white bracts that surround small, yellowish flowers, typically appearing in spring. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in woodland gardens. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth habit compared to the typical Cornus florida."
