    "intro": "Capparis littoralis, commonly known as the coastal caper, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and thorny stems that help it thrive in saline and sandy environments. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and produces small, round, greenish-yellow fruits. It is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including high salt exposure and strong winds. Capparis littoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
