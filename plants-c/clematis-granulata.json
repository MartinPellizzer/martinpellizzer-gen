    "intro": "Clematis granulata, commonly known as the granular clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are often covered in fine, granular hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners looking to add vertical interest. Clematis granulata is relatively low maintenance but requires support for its climbing growth habit."
