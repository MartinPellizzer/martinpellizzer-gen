    "intro": "Corytholoma cardinale, commonly known as the red-tailed antler fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, antler-like fronds that are often brightly colored, ranging from red to orange. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests. Its fronds are composed of tightly packed, scale-like leaves that help retain moisture. Corytholoma cardinale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
