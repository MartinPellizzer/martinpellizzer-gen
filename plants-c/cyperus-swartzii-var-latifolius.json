    "intro": "Cyperus swartzii var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by water or wind. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
