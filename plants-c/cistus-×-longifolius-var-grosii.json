It features aromatic evergreen leaves with a silver-white underside, and produces showy, pink to reddish flowers in the spring. The plant is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, thriving in full sun. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The species is also valued for its use in traditional herbal medicine and as a source of essential oils."
