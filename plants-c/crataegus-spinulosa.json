    "intro": "Crataegus spinulosa, commonly known as the thorny hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny branches and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus spinulosa thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed areas. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
