    "intro": "Carex planispicata, commonly known as the flat-spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Carex planispicata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
