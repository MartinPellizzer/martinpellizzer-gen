    "intro": "Camellia gigantocarpa, commonly known as the giant Chinese camellia, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, camellia-like flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is a prized specimen in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
