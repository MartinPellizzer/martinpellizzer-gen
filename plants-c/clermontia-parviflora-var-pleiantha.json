    "intro": "Clermontia parviflora var. pleiantha, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a rare Hawaiian plant characterized by its silvery, woolly foliage and solitary, showy yellow flowers. It is endemic to the island of Maui, specifically growing in the high-elevation areas of Haleakal\u0101. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry conditions and thrives in well-drained, volcanic soils. Its unique morphology includes a rosette of narrow, silver leaves that help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is classified as a federally endangered species."
