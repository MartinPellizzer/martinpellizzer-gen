    "intro": "Celsia demnatensis, commonly known as the Demnat's celsia, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Celastraceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of East Africa, particularly in Ethiopia and Eritrea. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Celsia demnatensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
