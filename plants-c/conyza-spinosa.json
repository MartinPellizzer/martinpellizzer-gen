    "intro": "Conyza spinosa, commonly known as goatweed, is a flowering plant native to Africa, Australia, and parts of Asia. It is an annual herb with slender, hairy stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant produces numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its widespread distribution. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Conyza spinosa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid environments."
