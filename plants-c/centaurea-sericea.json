    "intro": "Centaurea sericea, commonly known as silky centaury, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and western Asia. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright blue to purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, contributing to its silvery-green color. Silky centaury is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
