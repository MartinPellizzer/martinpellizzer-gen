    "intro": "Carum ferulaceum, commonly known as wild cumin or Indian cumin, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It features slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called schizocarps, which are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Its leaves are aromatic and have a slightly spicy flavor, similar to cumin. Carum ferulaceum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields."
