    "intro": "Cleistes mantiqueirae, commonly known as the Mantiqueira cleistocarp, is a rare flowering plant native to the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. It belongs to the Oenotheraceae family and is characterized by its unique, closed capsule fruit that does not open to release seeds. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in rocky, shaded areas. Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on plant adaptation and conservation."
