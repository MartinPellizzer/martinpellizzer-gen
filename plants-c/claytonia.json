    "intro": "Claytonia, commonly known as spring beauty, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae. These plants are native to North America and are typically found in moist, rocky soils in woodland areas. They are characterized by their delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. Claytonia species often have succulent leaves and stems, which help them retain moisture in their often harsh habitats. The genus includes several species, such as Claytonia caroliniana and Claytonia virginica, which are popular in native plant gardens."
