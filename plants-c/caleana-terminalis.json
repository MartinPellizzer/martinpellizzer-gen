    "intro": "Caleana terminalis, commonly known as the pink fairy tern, is a striking orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its vivid pink petals and a unique, bird-like appearance that mimics the coloration of a tern bird. The plant typically grows in heathlands and open forests, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs between September and November, producing clusters of fragrant, nectar-rich flowers. Caleana terminalis is a protected species due to habitat loss and is often found in conservation reserves."
