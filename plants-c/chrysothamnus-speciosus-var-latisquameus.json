It is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and is often found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in drought conditions. Its leaves are typically broad and covered in a dense layer of fine, scale-like hairs."
