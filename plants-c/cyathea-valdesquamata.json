    "intro": "Cyathea valdesquamata, commonly known as the Valde's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant exhibits a distinctive trunk that is covered in a fibrous, spongy material, which helps in water retention. Its fronds are typically bright green and can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, contributing to its ornamental value. Cyathea valdesquamata is often found in humid, tropical environments, thriving in shaded, moist forest understories."
