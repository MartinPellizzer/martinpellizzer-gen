    "intro": "Calceolaria debilissima, commonly known as the weakly bellflower, is a delicate annual plant native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange, often with a distinctive hood-like structure. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist conditions, and it thrives in well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. Calceolaria debilissima is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses due to its unique floral appearance."
