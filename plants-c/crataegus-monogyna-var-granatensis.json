    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna var. granatensis, commonly known as the Granatense hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to ovate leaves, and clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that ripen in late summer, which are edible but often used for ornamental purposes. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for hedging or ornamental gardens. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for both ecological and horticultural applications."
