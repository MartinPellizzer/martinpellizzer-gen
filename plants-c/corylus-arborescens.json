    "intro": "Corylus arborescens, commonly known as the hazel nut tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It produces catkin-like male flowers and female flowers that develop into edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. The nuts are an important food source for wildlife and are also harvested for human consumption."
