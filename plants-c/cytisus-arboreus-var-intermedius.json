It features slender, woody stems that are often branched and covered in fine, grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers in early spring, which are characteristic of the Fabaceae family. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. This variety is relatively hardy and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
