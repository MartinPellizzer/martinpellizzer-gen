It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are shorter and narrower than those of the typical hazel. The plant produces catkins and edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of wildlife food."
