    "intro": "Carandas arduina, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, Carandas arduina is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
