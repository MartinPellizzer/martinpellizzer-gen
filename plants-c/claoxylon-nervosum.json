    "intro": "Claoxylon nervosum, commonly known as the narrow-veined claoxylon, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Claoxylon nervosum is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its timber and ornamental qualities."
