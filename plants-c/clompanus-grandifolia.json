    "intro": "Clompanus grandifolia, commonly known as the grandiflora clompanus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking tropical flair. However, it requires specific care to flourish in non-native environments."
