It features prostrate stems covered with sticky, glandular hairs that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a hairy texture. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetland areas."
