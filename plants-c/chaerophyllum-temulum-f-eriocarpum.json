    "intro": "Chaerophyllum temulum f. eriocarpum, commonly known as the downy chaerophyllum, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its fruits are small, dry, and covered in a fine, hairy layer, which aids in seed dispersal. This fern-like plant is often found in temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia."
