    "intro": "Commelina kapiriensis, commonly known as the Kapiri spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Commelinaceae, which includes many species of grass-like plants and flowering herbs. The plant is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers, which are typically borne in clusters on leafy stems. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in its humid environment. Commelina kapiriensis plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
