    "intro": "Cornus cilicica, commonly known as the Eastern dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, greyish-brown bark. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a serrated edge, turning yellow in autumn. Cornus cilicica is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
