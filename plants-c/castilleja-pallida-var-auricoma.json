    "intro": "Castilleja pallida var. auricoma, commonly known as the pale castilleja with auriculate leaves, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often reddish stems and small, showy yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are usually small, opposite, and have a distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) base. Castilleja pallida var. auricoma forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi and relies on host plants for some of its nutrients."
