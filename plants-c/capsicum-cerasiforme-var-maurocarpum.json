    "intro": "Capsicum cerasiforme var. maurocarpum, commonly known as the black bell pepper. This variety is characterized by its dark, almost black, elongated fruits that resemble small peppers. The plant produces medium-sized, pointed fruits with a glossy skin that transitions from dark green to black as it matures. It is a compact shrub with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The botanical features of this variety make it unique among Capsicum species, particularly due to its distinctive coloration and fruit morphology."
