    "intro": "Centaurea cariensis subsp. longipapposa, commonly known as the long-pappous centaurea, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, conical inflorescences. Its distinctive feature is the elongated pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
