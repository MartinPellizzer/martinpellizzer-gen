    "intro": "Calanthe repens, commonly known as the creeping calanthe, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Asia. It features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread along the ground and form dense mats. The plant has strap-like, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and typically arranged in a loose raceme, with petals that are usually white or pale pink. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in woodland gardens."
