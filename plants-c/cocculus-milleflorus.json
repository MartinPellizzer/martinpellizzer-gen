    "intro": "Cocculus milleflorus, commonly known as the starry cocculus, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces distinctive, inflated, green fruits that turn yellow or orange as they mature. These fruits are often used in traditional medicine for their purported sedative and antispasmodic properties. Its botanical features make it a notable species in both horticultural and ethnobotanical contexts."
