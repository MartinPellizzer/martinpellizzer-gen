It is characterized by its thick, aromatic rhizomes and large, arrow-shaped leaves that emerge from the water or moist soil. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers surrounded by a showy, spadix-like structure. Calotesta is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
