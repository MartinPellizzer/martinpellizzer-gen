    "intro": "Cephalanthera austiniae, commonly known as Austin's\u6753\u5170, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, instead relying on atmospheric moisture and organic debris. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has a complex relationship with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in many regions."
