    "intro": "Coopernookia scabridiuscula, commonly known as the rough-skinned lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green to brown thallus with a rough, uneven surface. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on bark and soil in temperate regions. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead consisting of a symbiotic partnership between algae and fungi. Coopernookia scabridiuscula plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms."
