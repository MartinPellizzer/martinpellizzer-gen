    "intro": "Cathartolinum vestitum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in moist, shaded environments. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it is considered an invasive species in some areas."
