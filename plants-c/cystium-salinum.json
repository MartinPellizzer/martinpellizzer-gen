    "intro": "Cystium salinum, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to coastal and saline environments. It is adapted to grow in arid and salty soils, making it a hardy plant in harsh conditions. The plant has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. It produces yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cystium salinum plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing soil erosion."
