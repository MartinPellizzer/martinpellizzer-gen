    "intro": "Cupressus goveniana subsp. pygmaea, commonly known as the pygmy cypress, is a small evergreen conifer native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage and scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 2 meters, forming a rounded or conical shape. It produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, and it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique form and hardiness. This subspecies is adapted to coastal climates and thrives in well-drained soils."
