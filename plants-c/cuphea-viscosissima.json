    "intro": "Cuphea viscosissima, commonly known as sticky cuphea, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that give it a sticky texture, which helps deter herbivores. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens. Cuphea viscosissima is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like hummingbirds."
