It features dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its aromatic, resinous leaves and flowers have been historically used in perfumery and traditional medicine.
