    "intro": "Cyperus majestuosus, commonly known as the royal flatsedge, is a striking ornamental grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features tall, upright stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically found in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or near water bodies. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for water gardens and wetland landscapes."
