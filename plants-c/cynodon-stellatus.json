    "intro": "Cynodon stellatus, commonly known as the star grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and small, star-shaped inflorescences, which give it its common name. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, pastures, and disturbed areas. It is drought-tolerant and can spread through stolons, forming a dense mat. Cynodon stellatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
