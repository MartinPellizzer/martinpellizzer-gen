    "intro": "Castilleja confusa var. pubens, commonly known as the pubescent Indian paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant features showy, bright red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils."
