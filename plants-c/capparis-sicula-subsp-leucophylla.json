It is characterized by its pale green to white leaves, which are often covered in a fine, woolly layer. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by edible, tangy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
