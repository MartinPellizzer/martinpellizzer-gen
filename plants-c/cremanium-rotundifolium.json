    "intro": "Cremanium rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaved cremanium, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding a delicate aesthetic to its appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
