    "intro": "Chaetochloa lachnea, commonly known as silky hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy habitats in temperate regions. It features slender, erect stems that often form dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow, flat, and covered with fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
