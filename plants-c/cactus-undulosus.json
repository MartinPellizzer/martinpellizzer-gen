    "intro": "Cactus undulosus, commonly known as the wavy cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its ribbed, cylindrical stems that are covered in clusters of spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to drought conditions. The wavy cactus is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements and unique appearance."
