It is native to the Andes Mountains of South America, particularly in regions of Peru and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
