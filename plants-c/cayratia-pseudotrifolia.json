    "intro": "Cayratia pseudotrifolia, commonly known as the false trifoliate vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are dry, dehiscent capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. Cayratia pseudotrifolia is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
