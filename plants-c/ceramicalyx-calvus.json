    "intro": "Ceramicalyx calvus, commonly known as the smooth-leaved ceramicalyx, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its flowers emit a mild fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Ceramicalyx calvus is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
