It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features showy yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Chrysitrix distigmatosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
