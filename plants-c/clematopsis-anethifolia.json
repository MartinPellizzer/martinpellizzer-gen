    "intro": "Clematopsis anethifolia, commonly known as the anise-leaved clematopsis, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in rocky or calcareous soils. The plant features finely divided, anise-scented leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbrella-shaped inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. While not widely cultivated, it is appreciated in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique fragrance."
