It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
