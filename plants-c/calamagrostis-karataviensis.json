It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found in marshes, riverbanks, and wet meadows. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces feathery, panicle-like inflorescences. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
