It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its massive, buttressed roots and broad, umbrella-shaped canopy. The tree can grow up to 40 meters in height, making it one of the tallest species in its native habitat. Its trunk is often covered with a thick, fibrous bark that provides structural support and protection against pests. The plant produces showy white flowers and small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by animals."
