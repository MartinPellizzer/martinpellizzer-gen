    "intro": "Cosmianthemum brookeae, commonly known as the Brooke's cosmos, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its delicate, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, often with a subtle violet hue. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white\u7ed2\u6bdb, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its unique beauty and rarity, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
