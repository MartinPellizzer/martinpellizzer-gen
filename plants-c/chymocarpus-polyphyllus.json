    "intro": "Chymocarpus polyphyllus, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe, Asia, and North America. It features tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in dense clusters during the summer months, which are followed by distinctive, umbrella-shaped seed heads. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive. Botanically, it belongs to the family Iridaceae and is characterized by its showy inflorescences and adaptability to aquatic environments."
