    "intro": "Carex stenostachys, commonly known as narrow-stalked sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. Carex stenostachys is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse ecosystems."
