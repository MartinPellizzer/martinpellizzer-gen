    "intro": "Cyperus hawaicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wet, marshy environments and is often found in coastal areas and lowland wetlands. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
