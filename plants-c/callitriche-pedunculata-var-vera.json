    "intro": "Callitriche pedunculata var. vera, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has whorled leaves that are narrow and pointed, with small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its stems are often floating or submerged, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
