    "intro": "Conophyllum ripense, commonly known as the river conophyllum, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and riverine habitats of eastern Australia. It is a perennial herb with a sprawling growth habit, characterized by its fibrous, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming from late summer to autumn. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often covered with fine, silky hairs. Conophyllum ripense plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil along waterways and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
