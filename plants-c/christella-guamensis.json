    "intro": "Christella guamensis, commonly known as the Guam bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Guam in the Mariana Islands. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal forests and rocky areas. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which attract various pollinators. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and other threats, Christella guamensis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
