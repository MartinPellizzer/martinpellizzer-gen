    "intro": "Calytrix behriana, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal regions, thriving in sandy or well-drained soils. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Calytrix behriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in coastal ecosystems."
