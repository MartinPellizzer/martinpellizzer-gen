    "intro": "Cladocolea lenticellata, commonly known as the smooth-leaved daphne, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, round, greenish fruits. Its growth habit is low and spreading, often forming dense mats along the forest floor. Cladocolea lenticellata is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in rich, organic soils."
