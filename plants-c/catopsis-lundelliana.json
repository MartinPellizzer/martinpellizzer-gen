    "intro": "Catopsis lundelliana, commonly known as the Lundell's catopsis, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, acrocarpous moss that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with closely packed leaves that are often curved at the tips. Its spore-producing structures, called capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and are typically reddish in color. This moss is well adapted to low-light conditions and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
