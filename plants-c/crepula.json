    "intro": "Crepula, commonly known as the common thistle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It typically features spiny leaves and purple or pink flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, often growing in dry, disturbed soils. Crepula species are known for their ability to thrive in harsh environments, making them resilient weeds. Botanically, they are characterized by their basal rosettes and their role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
