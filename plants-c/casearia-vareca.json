    "intro": "Casearia vareca, commonly known as the white-flowered casearia, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
