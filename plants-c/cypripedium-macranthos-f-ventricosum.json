    "intro": "Cypripedium macranthos f. ventricosum, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. This hybrid form exhibits a unique combination of traits from its parent species, Cypripedium macranthos and Cypripedium calceolus. It features a large, showy yellow pouch-like structure that serves as a pollination trap, attracting insects such as bees and wasps. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a hybrid in orchid taxonomy and its ecological importance in its native habitat."
