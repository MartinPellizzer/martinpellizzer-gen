    "intro": "Carex ligerica var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow sedges, is a perennial sedge native to the moist, shaded environments of temperate regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly glossy, with a dense growth habit that forms compact clumps. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soils and requires consistent moisture without becoming waterlogged. This variety is often used in native plant gardens and wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and ornamental appeal."
