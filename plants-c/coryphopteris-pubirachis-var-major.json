    "intro": "Coryphopteris pubirachis var. major, commonly known as the giant huperzia, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that helps it thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and they bear sporangia on the underside, facilitating spore dispersal. This variant is notable for its size and adaptability to moist, nutrient-rich soils."
