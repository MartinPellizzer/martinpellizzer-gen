    "intro": "Crateva formosensis, commonly known as the Java morning glory, is a tropical climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to pink. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
