    "intro": "Callitriche autumnalis f. pedicellata, commonly known as the autumn waterstar, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer to autumn. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy, while the stems are slender and often floating. This variety is distinguished by its pedicellate flowers, which are borne on short stalks, giving it a delicate, aquatic appearance."
