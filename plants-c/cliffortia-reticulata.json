    "intro": "Cliffortia reticulata, commonly known as the netted flax or rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats on rocky outcrops and coastal cliffs. The plant features small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, net-like pattern of veins, giving it its common name. Cliffortia reticulata is adapted to harsh, sunny environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
