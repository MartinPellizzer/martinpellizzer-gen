    "intro": "Cereus myriacaulon, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and is capable of reaching heights of up to 15 meters. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, typically during the summer months. Its thick, ribbed stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant is often cultivated for its striking appearance and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
