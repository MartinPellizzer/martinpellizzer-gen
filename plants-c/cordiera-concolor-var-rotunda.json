    "intro": "Cordiera concolor var. rotunda, commonly known as the round-leaved cordiera, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It features thick, waxy leaves that are ovate to round in shape, often with a bluish-green hue and a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its unique foliage and ornamental berries make it a valuable addition to botanical collections."
