    "intro": "Cyclantheropsis parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered cyclothera, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, commonly referred to as the gourd or cucumber family. It is a climbing vine characterized by its slender stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow, tubular flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Cyclantheropsis parviflora is native to tropical regions of South America and is often found in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant morphology and ecological adaptation."
