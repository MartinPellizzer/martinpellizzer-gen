    "intro": "Clematis guadeloupae var. medusaea, commonly known as the Medusa's hair clematis, is a rare and striking plant native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its long, feathery inflorescences that resemble flowing hair, giving it its evocative common name. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing along coastal areas or in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
