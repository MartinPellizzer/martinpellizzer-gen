    "intro": "Cycas circinalis f. maritima, commonly known as the coastal cycad, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, fern-like leaves and a stout, unbranched trunk that develops a thick, bark-like covering with age. This plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. It reproduces through cones, producing both male and female structures on separate plants. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
