    "intro": "Cienfuegosia triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf cienfuegosia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
