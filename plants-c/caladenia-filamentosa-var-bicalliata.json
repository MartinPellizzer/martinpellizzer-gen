    "intro": "Caladenia filamentosa var. bicalliata, commonly known as the Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, pale green to white flowers with intricate, veined petals and a distinctive, elongated labellum. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its flowers bloom during the cooler months, usually between late autumn and early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring careful conservation efforts."
