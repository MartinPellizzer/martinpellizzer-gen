    "intro": "Cnicus spurius, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the end of each stem. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cnicus spurius is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to harsh, arid environments."
