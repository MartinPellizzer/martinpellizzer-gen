    "intro": "Carex serotina subsp. fennica, commonly known as the Finnish sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This subspecies typically grows in moist to wet environments such as bogs, marshes, and wet meadows. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
