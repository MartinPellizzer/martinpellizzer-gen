    "intro": "Chordorrhiza, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial orchid that lacks leaves and relies entirely on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant's unique appearance includes pale green or white flowers that bloom in late summer. Chordorrhiza is classified as an endangered species due to habitat loss and environmental changes. Its botanical significance lies in its specialized adaptations and ecological role in its native ecosystem."
