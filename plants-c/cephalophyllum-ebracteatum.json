    "intro": "Cephalophyllum ebracteatum, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that grows low to the ground, with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it store water in its native desert environment. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its unique structure, with a central cluster of flowers surrounded by modified leaves, is an adaptation to its harsh habitat. Cephalophyllum ebracteatum is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to drought conditions."
