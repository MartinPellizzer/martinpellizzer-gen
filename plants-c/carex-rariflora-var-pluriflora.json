    "intro": "Carex rariflora var. pluriflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its flowers are usually greenish or brownish, and it produces small, wind-pollinated seeds. This species is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
