    "intro": "Clematis hexapetala var. tchefouensis, commonly known as the Tchefou Clematis, is a rare and ornamental vine native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its delicate, white, six-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with three leaflets, and its stems are covered in fine, silky hairs. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
