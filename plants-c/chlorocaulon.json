These organisms are typically unicellular or colonial, with a simple structure consisting of a cell wall, chloroplasts, and a nucleus. They are characterized by their ability to perform photosynthesis, utilizing chlorophyll a and b for light absorption. Chlorocaulon species are often found in aquatic environments, including ponds, lakes, and damp soil. Their rapid growth and adaptability make them important indicators of water quality and ecological health."
