    "intro": "Camarotis loheri, commonly known as the Loher's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often forming a rosette at the base of the stem. Camarotis loheri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
