It is characterized by its vibrant, variegated foliage, which often features a combination of green, yellow, and red hues. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
