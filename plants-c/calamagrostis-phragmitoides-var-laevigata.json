    "intro": "Calamagrostis phragmitoides var. laevigata, commonly known as the velvet false sweetgrass, is a perennial grass native to wetland and marshy areas of North America. It features tall, slender stalks that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, bluish-green leaves that are smooth and slightly hairy. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers in late summer, which are often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along lake shores. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland restoration and landscape design."
