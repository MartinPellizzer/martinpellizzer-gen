    "intro": "Chersodoma tarijensis, commonly known as the Tarijensis nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, specifically Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are usually ovate and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native arid environment. Chersodoma tarijensis is also known for its toxic properties, containing alkaloids that can be harmful if ingested."
