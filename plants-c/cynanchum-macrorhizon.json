It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its erect stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by follicles containing seeds with silky pappi for wind dispersal. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
