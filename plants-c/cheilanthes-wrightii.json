    "intro": "Cheilanthes wrightii, commonly known as Wright's rockcap, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant is adapted to arid and rocky environments, often growing on limestone or sandstone. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils with minimal water requirements."
