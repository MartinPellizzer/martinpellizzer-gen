    "intro": "Cardamine integrifolia var. sinuata, commonly known as the smooth water-calcicle, is a delicate perennial herb native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically basal and have a smooth, sinuate margin. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
