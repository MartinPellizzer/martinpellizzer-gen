    "intro": "Centaurea antennata subsp. meridionalis, commonly known as the southern star-thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny, bristly leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
