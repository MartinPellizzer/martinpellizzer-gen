It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. It is native to southern Africa and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
