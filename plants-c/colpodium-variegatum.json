    "intro": "Colpodium variegatum, commonly known as the variegated bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Colpodium variegatum is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the absorption of nutrients from captured prey."
