    "intro": "Cereus lividus var. glaucior, commonly known as the pale blue cactus, is a striking succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features a tall, spindly stem that can grow up to several meters in height, covered in dense clusters of white or pale blue flowers. The plant produces showy, nocturnal blooms that open at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its foliage consists of sparse, ribbed stems with spines, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil and full sun."
