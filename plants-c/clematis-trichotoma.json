    "intro": "Clematis trichotoma, commonly known as the hairy clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 20 feet, allowing it to climb trees and other structures. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three ovate to lance-shaped leaflets with hairy surfaces. Clematis trichotoma thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
