    "intro": "Cercocarpus flabellifolius, commonly known as the Sierra Madre curlleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are deeply lobed and often curl at the edges, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is an important species for local wildlife and plant biodiversity."
