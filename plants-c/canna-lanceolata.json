    "intro": "Canna lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf canna, is a striking tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in summer. Canna lanceolata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense clumps over time."
