    "intro": "Cladocolea alternifolia, commonly known as the alternate-leaf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on root connections to host species. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to regions of southern Africa and is typically found in open, disturbed habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host plants."
