    "intro": "Cremanium granulosum, commonly known as the granular cremanium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
