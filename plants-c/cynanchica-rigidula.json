    "intro": "Cynanchica rigidula, commonly known as rigid milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in slender, cylindrical pods that mature into dry, dehiscent fruits. Cynanchica rigidula is adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and efficient water-use strategies."
