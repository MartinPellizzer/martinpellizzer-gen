    "intro": "Cotoneaster racemiflorus var. nummularioides, commonly known as the silver cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern Himalayas. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine silvery or grayish-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries that are attractive to birds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes. This variety is relatively hardy and adaptable to a range of soil types, making it suitable for garden use in temperate climates."
