    "intro": "Cliffortia serpyllifolia var. foliis-latioribus, commonly known as the broad-leaved carpet grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, bright green, ovate leaves that are broader than the standard variety. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
