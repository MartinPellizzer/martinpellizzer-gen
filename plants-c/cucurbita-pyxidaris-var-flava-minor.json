    "intro": "Cucurbita pyxidaris var. flava-minor, commonly known as the yellow squash or yellow crookneck squash, is a variant of the common squash species. It is characterized by its elongated, yellowish-green fruits with a smooth, waxy skin. The plant is a vine that produces male and female flowers, typical of many cucurbit species. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often covered in a fine, fuzzy coating. This variety is valued for its edible fruits, which are harvested when immature for their tender texture and mild flavor."
