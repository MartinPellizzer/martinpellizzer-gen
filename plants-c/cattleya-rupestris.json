    "intro": "Cattleya rupestris, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding substrate, making it well-suited to its natural habitat. Cattleya rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
