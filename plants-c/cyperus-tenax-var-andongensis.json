It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and flooded fields, and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems."
