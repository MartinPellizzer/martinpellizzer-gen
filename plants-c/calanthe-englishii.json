    "intro": "Calanthe englishii, commonly known as the English calanthe, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant features a pseudobulb system, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting to its cool, moist forest habitat. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette and are glossy with a waxy texture. Calanthe englishii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
