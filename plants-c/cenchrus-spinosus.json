    "intro": "Cenchrus spinosus, commonly known as the spiny grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive spiny bracts along the stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Cenchrus spinosus is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for forage or as a ornamental plant."
