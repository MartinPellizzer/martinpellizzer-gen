    "intro": "Calystegia binghamiae, commonly known as Bingham's bindweed, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its twining stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a hairy texture. Calystegia binghamiae is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
