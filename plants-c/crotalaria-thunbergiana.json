    "intro": "Crotalaria thunbergiana, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a tough, leathery pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds effectively. Crotalaria thunbergiana is often found in grasslands and is valued for its ecological benefits in supporting biodiversity."
