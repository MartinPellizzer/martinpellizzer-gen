    "intro": "Celosia major, commonly known as the firecracker flower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky bracts that resemble fireworks, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. Its foliage is lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are erect and branching. Celosia major is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
