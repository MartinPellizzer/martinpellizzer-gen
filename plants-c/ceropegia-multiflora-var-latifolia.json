    "intro": "Ceropegia multiflora var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf ceropegia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, succulent stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, attracting specific pollinators such as moths and flies. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to trail from hanging baskets or shelves."
