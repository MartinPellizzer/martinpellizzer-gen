    "intro": "Cissus humulifolia f. brevipedunculata, commonly known as the short-stalked grape ivy, is a variant of the species Cissus humulifolia. It is a climbing plant native to South Africa, characterized by its trailing habit and distinctive, heart-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture, and the plant produces small, greenish-white flowers. This form is distinguished by its shorter peduncles compared to the typical form, which makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets and indoor decoration. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
