    "intro": "Corysanthes palearifera, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in coastal environments with saline conditions. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Corysanthes palearifera is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
