    "intro": "Cyrtoceras coriaceum, commonly known as the thick-shelled cockle, is a species of bivalve mollusk rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects. It is characterized by its robust, calcareous shell with a distinctive shape. The shell is typically thick and heavy, with a smooth surface and a slightly convex shape. It is often found in marine environments, particularly in shallow waters. This species plays an important role in marine ecosystems as a filter feeder."
