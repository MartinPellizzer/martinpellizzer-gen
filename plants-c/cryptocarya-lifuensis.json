    "intro": "Cryptocarya lifuensis, commonly known as the Lifu cryptomeria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the island of Lifu in the Tonga archipelago, where it grows in humid, tropical forest environments. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in axillary inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries as fruit. Due to its limited geographic range and habitat specificity, Cryptocarya lifuensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
