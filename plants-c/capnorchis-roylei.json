    "intro": "Capnorchis roylei, commonly known as the Himalayan orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its blooming period occurs during the spring and early summer, adding a touch of color to the otherwise stark mountain landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Capnorchis roylei is considered a vulnerable species."
