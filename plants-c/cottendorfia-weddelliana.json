    "intro": "Cottendorfia weddelliana, commonly known as the Antarctic hair-cress, is a flowering plant native to the extreme environments of Antarctica and the southern tip of South America. It is a small, herbaceous plant that thrives in cold, arid conditions, often growing in rocky soils and on exposed ground. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the short Antarctic summer. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss and protect against harsh winds. Cottendorfia weddelliana is an example of a plant that has adapted to survive in one of the most extreme climates on Earth."
