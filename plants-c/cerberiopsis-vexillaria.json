    "intro": "Cerberiopsis vexillaria, commonly known as the velvetleaf cerberiopsis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fallow fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas."
