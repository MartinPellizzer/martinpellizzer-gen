    "intro": "Cypripedium guttatum f. redowskii, commonly known as the Redowski's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive red and white coloration, which serve to attract specific pollinators. The plant has a pseudobulb structure typical of many orchids, which helps it store water and nutrients in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to withstand the cool, moist conditions of its high-altitude environment. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this orchid is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
