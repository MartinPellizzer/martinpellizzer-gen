    "intro": "Cephalanthera damasonium f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender green orchid, is a rare and elegant orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and delicate, greenish-white flowers that lack the typical purple or pink hues of other orchid species. The plant is epipetric, meaning it grows on calcareous rocks, and thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in many regions."
