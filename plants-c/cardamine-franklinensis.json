    "intro": "Cardamine franklinensis, commonly known as Franklin's water shield, is a rare aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has small, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in a single umbel, and it produces small, elliptical fruits. Due to habitat loss and pollution, it is considered endangered in many regions."
