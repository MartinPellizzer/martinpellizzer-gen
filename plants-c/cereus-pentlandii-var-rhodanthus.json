    "intro": "Cereus pentlandii var. rhodanthus, commonly known as the red-tipped cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom at night. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for succulent gardens."
