    "intro": "Coussarea friburgensis, commonly known as the Friburgensis coussaraya, is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. It is a woody shrub or small tree native to the humid forests of South America, particularly in Brazil. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
