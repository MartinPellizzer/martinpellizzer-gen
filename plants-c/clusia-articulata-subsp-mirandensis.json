    "intro": "Clusia articulata subsp. mirandensis, commonly known as the Mirandense Clusia, is a tropical shrub native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, facilitating dispersal by wind or animals. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and adaptability to shaded conditions."
