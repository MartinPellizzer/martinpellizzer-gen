    "intro": "Cornus candidissima, commonly known as white dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and prefers well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. Cornus candidissima is often used in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
