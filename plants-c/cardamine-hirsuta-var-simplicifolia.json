    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta var. simplicifolia, commonly known as the hairy watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It features a low-growing rosette of trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet having a serrated margin. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are borne on slender stems above the foliage. Its leaves are covered in fine, hairy glands, giving it a distinctive texture and aiding in water retention. This variety is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
