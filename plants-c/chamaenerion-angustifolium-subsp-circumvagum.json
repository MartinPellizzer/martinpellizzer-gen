    "intro": "Chamaenerion angustifolium subsp. circumvagum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fireweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides, in meadows, and in wetlands, and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. It produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. This subspecies is known for its adaptability and can colonize areas quickly after environmental disturbances."
