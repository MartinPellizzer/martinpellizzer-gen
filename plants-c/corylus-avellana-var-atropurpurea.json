    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple husk hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive purple-brown husks that encase its edible nuts, which are typically harvested in late summer. The plant produces catkin-like male flowers and female flowers that develop into the characteristic hazelnuts. Its leaves are typically oval with serrated edges and turn a vibrant yellow in autumn. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and unique nut husks."
