    "intro": "Cycas badensis, commonly known as the Borneo cycad, is a species of cycad native to the island of Borneo. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones spherical, typical of cycads. Cycas badensis is a slow-growing plant that thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions."
