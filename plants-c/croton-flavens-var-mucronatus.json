It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often brightly colored with shades of yellow, red, and green. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
