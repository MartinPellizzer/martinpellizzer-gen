    "intro": "Cephalophyllum worcesterense, commonly known as Worcester's headplant, is a rare and specialized member of the Portulacaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
