    "intro": "Coffea mozambicana, commonly known as Mozambique coffee, is a species native to East Africa, particularly Mozambique. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain two seeds, which are used for coffee production. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less commercially cultivated coffee species."
