    "intro": "Canthium parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, typical of the spurge family. Its sap is milky and contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation. Canthium parviflorum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including forests and open fields."
