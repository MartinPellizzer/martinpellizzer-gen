    "intro": "Cardamine umbrosa, commonly known as the shadowy watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. The plant thrives in rich, organic soil and requires consistent moisture, making it a common sight in woodland understories. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family, which includes other notable species like buttercups and lilies. Due to its preference for shaded areas, it is often found growing in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
