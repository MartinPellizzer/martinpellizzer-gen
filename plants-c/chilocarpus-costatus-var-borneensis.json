    "intro": "Chilocarpus costatus var. borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a rare and woody shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood and small, elliptical leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by yellowish berries that contain a single seed. It is known for its high density and durability, making it valuable for traditional craftsmanship. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered threatened in its natural range."
