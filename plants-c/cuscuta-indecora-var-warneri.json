    "intro": "Cuscuta indecora var. warneri, commonly known as the Warner's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, thread-like stem that wraps around its host plant. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host, but it plays a role in ecological systems by influencing plant community dynamics."
