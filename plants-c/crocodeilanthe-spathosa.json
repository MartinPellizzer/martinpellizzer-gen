    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe spathosa, commonly known as the dragon's tongue fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often fleshy fronds that resemble a dragon's tongue. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain water in its natural habitat. Crocodeilanthe spathosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
