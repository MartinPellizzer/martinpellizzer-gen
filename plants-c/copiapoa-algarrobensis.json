    "intro": "Copiapoa algarrobensis, commonly known as the Algarrob\u00edn cactus, is a species native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is a columnar cactus with a ribbed stem and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stem and having a shallow root system. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
