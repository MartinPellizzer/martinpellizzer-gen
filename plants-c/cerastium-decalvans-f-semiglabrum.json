    "intro": "Cerastium decalvans f. semiglabrum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate stems and small, opposite, ovate leaves that are generally smooth and glabrous. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cool, temperate climates and contribute to its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
