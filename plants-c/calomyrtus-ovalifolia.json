    "intro": "Calomyrtus ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaved myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its aromatic leaves and flowers are often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine for their purported healing properties. Calomyrtus ovalifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and dry forest environments."
