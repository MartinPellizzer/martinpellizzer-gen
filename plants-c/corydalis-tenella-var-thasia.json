    "intro": "Corydalis tenella var. thasia, commonly known as the spring corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces delicate, spurred flowers in shades of pink and purple during the spring season. The plant features slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with three ovate to lanceolate leaflets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and the subtle fragrance of its flowers."
