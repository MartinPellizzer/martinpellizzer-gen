    "intro": "Cydonia oblonga f. lusitanica, commonly known as the Portuguese quince, is a cultivar of the quince tree characterized by its distinct fruit morphology. It produces large, elongated fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color when mature. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in autumn, and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its flowers are fragrant and white, appearing in clusters during late spring. The fruit is often used in cooking, particularly in jams and preserves, due to its high pectin content."
