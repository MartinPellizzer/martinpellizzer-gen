    "intro": "Cheiranthus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf wallflower, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found growing on slopes or in coastal areas. Due to its compact size and vibrant flowers, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements."
