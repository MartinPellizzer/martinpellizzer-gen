It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fronds are composed of many small, overlapping pinnae, which contribute to its distinctive appearance.
