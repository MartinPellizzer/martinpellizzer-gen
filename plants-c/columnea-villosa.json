    "intro": "Columnea villosa, commonly known as the hairy columnea, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It features showy, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange with a contrasting yellow throat, attracting hummingbirds and other pollinators. The plant has opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea villosa is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
