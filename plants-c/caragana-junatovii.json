It is characterized by its small, compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought and poor soil conditions. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. Caragana junatovii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging climates."
