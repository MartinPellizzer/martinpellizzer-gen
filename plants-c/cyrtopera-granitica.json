    "intro": "Cyrtopera granitica, commonly known as the granite crag fern, is a species of fern native to rocky, arid environments. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on exposed rock faces or in crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to unstable substrates. Cyrtopera granitica is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low moisture conditions."
