It features fine, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed sites. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native gardens and erosion control."
