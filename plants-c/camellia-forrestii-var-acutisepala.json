    "intro": "Camellia forrestii var. acutisepala, commonly known as the Yunnan camellia, is a rare and ornamental evergreen shrub native to China. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves and striking, double-layered pink to red flowers that bloom in winter and early spring. The plant thrives in partial shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
