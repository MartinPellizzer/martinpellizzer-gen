    "intro": "Calamagrostis dahurica, commonly known as the Siberian reed, is a perennial grass native to the colder regions of Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often along riverbanks and in wet meadows. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing airy plumes of pale green to golden-brown flowers. Calamagrostis dahurica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist environments."
