It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its delicate blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. This species is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
