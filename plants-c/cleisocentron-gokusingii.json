It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of narrow, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
