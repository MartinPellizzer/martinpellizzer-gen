    "intro": "Cordia finlaysoniana, commonly known as the Bornean hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, with smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Cordia finlaysoniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
