    "intro": "Commelina scandens, commonly known as the creeping spiderwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground or climb supports. The plant produces small, showy flowers with three blue or violet petals and three white sepals, which are typically borne in clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often have a waxy coating. Commelina scandens is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed soils."
