    "intro": "Cayratia delicatula, commonly known as the silver vine, is a climbing plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is popular in horticulture."
