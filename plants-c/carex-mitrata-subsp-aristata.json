It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often sharply pointed, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, three-ranked spikelets. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
