    "intro": "Claytonia stolonifera, commonly known as the mountain sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It features rosettes of oval, fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically reddish or purplish in color. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or shaded areas. Its stolons allow it to spread and form dense mats, making it a hardy and resilient species."
