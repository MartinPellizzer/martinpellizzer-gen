    "intro": "Cryptolobus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces striking white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is listed as endangered. Cryptolobus is often found growing on the bases of cypress trees, where it forms a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi."
