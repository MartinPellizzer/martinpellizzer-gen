    "intro": "Centaurea paniculata var. aplolepa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces showy, globular inflorescences composed of numerous bright yellow to orange-red flowers. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a grayish-blue hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. This variety is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
