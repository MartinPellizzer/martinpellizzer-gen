    "intro": "Chaetolepis perijensis var. perijensis, commonly known as the Perijan mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Perij\u00e1 region, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions, a unique trait among its relatives. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates in its mountainous habitat. It plays a vital role in the local ecosystem by providing shelter for small invertebrates and contributing to soil stability. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native range."
