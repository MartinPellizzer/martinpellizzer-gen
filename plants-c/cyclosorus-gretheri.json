    "intro": "Cyclosorus gretheri, commonly known as the Grether's water star, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its floating, star-shaped leaves that consist of four to eight lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures are submerged, and it produces tiny, yellowish spores rather than flowers. Cyclosorus gretheri is often used in water gardens and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to improve water clarity."
