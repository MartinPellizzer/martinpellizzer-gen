    "intro": "Cousinia chrysantha var. aspera, commonly known as the rough yellow gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in alpine or steppe environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in arid and semi-arid regions."
