    "intro": "Cupressus benthamii var. knightiana, commonly known as the Knight's lace-cypress, is a rare and ornamental conifer native to China. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and its distinctive, feathery foliage that resembles lace. The plant produces small, spherical cones and has scale-like leaves that are densely packed along the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
