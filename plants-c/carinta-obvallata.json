    "intro": "Carinta obvallata, commonly known as the oval-leaf carinta, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or well-drained soils. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh climate. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, often displaying shades of white or pale purple. Carinta obvallata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
