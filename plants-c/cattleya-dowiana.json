    "intro": "Cattleya dowiana, commonly known as the White Lady Cattleya, is a tropical orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, fragrant, white flowers with a subtle pinkish tinge and prominent yellow lips. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered in a thick layer of moss, which helps retain moisture. Cattleya dowiana is prized for its beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value."
