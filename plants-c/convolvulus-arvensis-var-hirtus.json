    "intro": "Convolvulus arvensis var. hirtus, commonly known as hairy field bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its vines can spread aggressively, often forming dense mats that compete with other vegetation. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields."
