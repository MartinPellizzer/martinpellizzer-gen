The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in loose inflorescences, blooming in the spring. The berries are often consumed by birds and are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
