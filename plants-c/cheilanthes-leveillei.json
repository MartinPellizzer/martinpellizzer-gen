    "intro": "Cheilanthes leveillei, commonly known as the desert shield fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and thick, leathery fronds that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a hardy species in harsh climates. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of hair, which further aids in reducing water loss. This fern is commonly found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, where it thrives in full sun."
