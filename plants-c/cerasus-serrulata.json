    "intro": "Cerasus serrulata, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or Prunus serrulata, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has oval, serrated leaves that turn yellow in autumn, adding to its ornamental value. Its fruit is a small, tart cherry that is edible but not commonly cultivated for consumption. Cerasus serrulata is widely appreciated in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and cultural significance."
