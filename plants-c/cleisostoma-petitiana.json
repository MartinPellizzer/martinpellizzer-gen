    "intro": "Cleisostoma petitiana, commonly known as the small-flowered cleisostoma, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually ovate and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its compact appearance. Cleisostoma petitiana is often found in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil."
