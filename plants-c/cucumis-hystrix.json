    "intro": "Cucumis hystrix, commonly known as the spiky cucumber or wild cucumber, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, spiny stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, green, spiky fruits that are typically harvested when immature. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and melons. The botanical features of Cucumis hystrix make it distinct from its domesticated relatives, such as the common cucumber."
