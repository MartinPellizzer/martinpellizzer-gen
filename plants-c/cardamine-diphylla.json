    "intro": "Cardamine diphylla, commonly known as the two-leaved water cress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features a basal rosette of kidney-shaped leaves and produces slender, flowering stems that bear small white or greenish flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic properties. Cardamine diphylla is also valued as a food source for certain insect species and contributes to the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems."
