    "intro": "Crataegus vittata, commonly known as the yellow hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, yellow or orange berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats. Crataegus vittata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and pollinators."
