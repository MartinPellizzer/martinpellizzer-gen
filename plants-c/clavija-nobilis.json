    "intro": "Clavija nobilis, commonly known as the noble clavija, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are often harvested for their aromatic properties and medicinal uses. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, Clavija nobilis is considered an endangered species."
