    "intro": "Carex cespitosa subsp. minuta, commonly known as dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered flowers in early summer. The plant typically forms compact clumps, with slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is a popular choice for water garden and pond edge plantings."
