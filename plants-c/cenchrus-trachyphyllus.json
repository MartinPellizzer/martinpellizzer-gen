    "intro": "Cenchrus trachyphyllus, commonly known as the roughhairy grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
