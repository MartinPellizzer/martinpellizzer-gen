    "intro": "Cochlioda chasei, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cochlioda chasei plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is not as commonly cultivated as other milkweed species."
