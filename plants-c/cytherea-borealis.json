    "intro": "Cytherea borealis, commonly known as the northern starflower, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a low-growing habit. Cytherea borealis plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators in its harsh environment."
