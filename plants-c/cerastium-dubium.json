It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Cerastium dubium is often found in disturbed soils and can spread through both seeds and vegetative means."
