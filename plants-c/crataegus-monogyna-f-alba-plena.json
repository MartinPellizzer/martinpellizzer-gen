It is characterized by its abundant white flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 3 to 6 meters. Its flowers are borne in clusters and are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit, which follows the flowers, is a small red berry that matures in late summer."
