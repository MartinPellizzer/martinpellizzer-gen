    "intro": "Cephaloschefflera, commonly known as the umbrella tree, is a tropical plant belonging to the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-like arrangement of compound leaves, which give it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant typically features a short, unbranched stem with large, palmately divided leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. Cephaloschefflera thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by bright red berries, which are a feature of its reproductive cycle."
