    "intro": "Cupania juliflora, commonly known as the sweetgum or American sweetgum, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by spiny, spherical fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy species suitable for a variety of landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and distinctive fruit structure."
