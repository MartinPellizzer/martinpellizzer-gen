    "intro": "Carex paludosa var. spadicea, commonly known as the yellow sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces cylindrical spikes of yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
