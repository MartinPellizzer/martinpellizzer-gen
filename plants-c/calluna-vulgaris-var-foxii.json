    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris var. foxii, commonly known as the Fox's heather, is a variant of the common heather. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically produces flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Native to the British Isles, it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense ground cover in suitable habitats."
