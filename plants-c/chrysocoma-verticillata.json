    "intro": "Chrysocoma verticillata, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Chrysocoma verticillata is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
