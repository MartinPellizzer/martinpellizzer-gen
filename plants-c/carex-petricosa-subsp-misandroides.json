    "intro": "Carex petricosa subsp. misandroides, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and compact, spiky inflorescences, typical of the Carex genus. This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a valuable plant for erosion control. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
