    "intro": "Cinnagrostis sclerantha, commonly known as the hard-stemmed goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Cinnagrostis sclerantha is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in sandy soils."
