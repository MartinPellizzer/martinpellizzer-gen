    "intro": "Cornus kousa, commonly known as the Kousa dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its showy, white or pink bracts that appear in spring, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its fruit is a red, fleshy drupe that attracts birds. Cornus kousa is valued in gardens for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in partial shade."
