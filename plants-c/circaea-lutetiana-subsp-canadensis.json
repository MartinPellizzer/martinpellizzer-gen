    "intro": "Circaea lutetiana subsp. canadensis, commonly known as Canadian whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender stems and hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils in woodlands and along streambanks. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Primulaceae family and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
