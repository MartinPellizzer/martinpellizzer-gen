It is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. Its roots are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The orchid's structure includes a pseudobulb, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients and moisture."
