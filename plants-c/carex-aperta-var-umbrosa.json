    "intro": "Carex aperta var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shaded carex, is a perennial sedge native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are followed by cylindrical, three-sided seed heads. It thrives in wet soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in moist habitats."
