    "intro": "Caltha gracilis, commonly known as the slender marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial native to moist, temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in wet or waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. Caltha gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in its natural habitat."
