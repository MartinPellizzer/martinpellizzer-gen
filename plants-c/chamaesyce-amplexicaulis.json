    "intro": "Chamaesyce amplexicaulis, commonly known as the broadleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically borne in dense clusters along the stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its low-growing form and drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and erosion control."
