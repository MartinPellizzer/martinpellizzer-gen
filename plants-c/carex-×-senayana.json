It is a natural hybrid between Carex breviculmis and Carex macrocephala, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows in wetlands and moist soils, preferring partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The inflorescence consists of a spike of green to brownish flowers, which are often wind-pollinated."
