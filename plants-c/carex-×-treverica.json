It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, often dark green leaves arranged in dense, grass-like clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, which are borne on cylindrical inflorescences. Carex \u00d7 treverica is often found in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its ability to thrive in wet environments makes it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
