    "intro": "Catasetum richteri, commonly known as the orchid with the peculiar floral structure, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is characterized by its unique, pendulous inflorescence that bears showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its native habitat. Its flowers have specialized structures, including a labellum that plays a role in pollination by certain wasps. Catasetum richteri is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
