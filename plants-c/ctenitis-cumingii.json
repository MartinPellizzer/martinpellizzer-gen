    "intro": "Ctenitis cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's tree fern, is a tropical plant native to the wet forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are typically bright green and can be used in traditional medicine in some regions."
