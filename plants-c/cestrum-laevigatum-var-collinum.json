It features opposite, elliptic leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. These flowers are followed by orange-red berries that contain the seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to warm, humid climates."
