    "intro": "Cyperus capensis f. globospica, commonly known as the globular flatsedge, is a compact, herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a dense, rounded rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous brown flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on short, stiff stems. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, making it a common sight in swampy areas and along waterways. Its adaptability to wet conditions and ornamental form make it a popular choice for water gardens and wetland restoration projects."
