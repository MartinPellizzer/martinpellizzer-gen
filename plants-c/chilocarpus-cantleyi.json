    "intro": "Chilocarpus cantleyi, commonly known as the Cantley's holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are glossy green in appearance. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
