    "intro": "Chrysopogon shrirangii, commonly known as Shrirang grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered along the stem. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions."
