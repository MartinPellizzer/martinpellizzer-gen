    "intro": "Cyanea lanceolata subsp. calycina, commonly known as the Hawaiian coral tree, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, coral-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
