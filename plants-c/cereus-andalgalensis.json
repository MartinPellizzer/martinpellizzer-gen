    "intro": "Cereus andalgalensis, commonly known as the Andalusian night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of southern Spain. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and the ability to produce large, white, night-blooming flowers. The plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Its flowers emit a strong fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Cereus andalgalensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming behavior."
