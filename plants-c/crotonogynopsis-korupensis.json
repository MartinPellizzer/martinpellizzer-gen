    "intro": "Crotonogynopsis korupensis, commonly known as the Korup croton, is a small tree native to the rainforests of Cameroon. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
