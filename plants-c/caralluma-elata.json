    "intro": "Caralluma elata, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and potatoes, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its ability to store water in its thick stems allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Caralluma elata is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies."
