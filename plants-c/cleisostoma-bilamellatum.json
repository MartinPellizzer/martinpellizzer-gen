It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, often pendulous growth habit. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive two-lipped structure, which is a key feature in its classification. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Cleisostoma bilamellatum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
