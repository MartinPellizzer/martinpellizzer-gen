    "intro": "Cypripedium palmifolium, commonly known as the giant white lady's tresses, is a striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a distinctive, long, spiraling inflorescence with numerous small, white petals and a prominent, yellow-green lip. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in many parts of its range."
