    "intro": "Canarium pseudopatentinervium, commonly known as the narrow-veined candlenut, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with parallel venation, which distinguish it from other species in the Canarium genus. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by the development of woody, spherical fruits. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and potential economic uses."
