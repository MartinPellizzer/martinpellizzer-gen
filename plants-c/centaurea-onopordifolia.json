It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the flower head. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and rocky soils, showing a high tolerance for saline and arid conditions. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Centaurea onopordifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
