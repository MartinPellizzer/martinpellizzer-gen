    "intro": "Clypeola bruhnsii, commonly known as the Br\u00fchns' shield fern, is a rare and lesser-known fern species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its unique, shield-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, preferring rich, organic soil. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Clypeola bruhnsii is considered a species of conservation concern."
