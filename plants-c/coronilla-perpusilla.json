    "intro": "Coronilla perpusilla, commonly known as the small crownvetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration efforts."
