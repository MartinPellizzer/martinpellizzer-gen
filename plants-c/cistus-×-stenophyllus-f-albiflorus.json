It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or coastal environments. Its compact growth habit and aromatic leaves make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
