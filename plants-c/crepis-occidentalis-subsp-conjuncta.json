    "intro": "Crepis occidentalis subsp. conjuncta, commonly known as the western cock's-comb, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are basal and linear, often with a rough texture, while the stems are erect and branched. The flowers bloom in spring, producing a distinctive, fluffy appearance that resembles a cock's comb, hence its common name."
