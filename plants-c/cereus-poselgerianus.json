    "intro": "Cereus poselgerianus, commonly known as the Poselgerian candleplant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a tall, unbranched stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height, covered with a dense layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces large, showy white flowers at night, which emit a strong, sweet scent to attract pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to small, spiny structures, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal rainfall. The species is often cultivated for its striking appearance and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
