    "intro": "Czeikia biloba, commonly known as the bilobed czeikia, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive bilobed leaves, which are often divided into two symmetrical lobes. The plant typically grows in temperate regions, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in umbels, a common feature among members of its family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Czeikia biloba is considered a botanically interesting but endangered species."
