    "intro": "Colophospermum mopane, commonly known as mopane, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by woody pods containing edible seeds. Mopane is well-adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It is also valued for its wood, which is used in construction and fuel."
