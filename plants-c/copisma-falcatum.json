    "intro": "Copisma falcatum, commonly known as the Florida flag iris, is a striking aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a distinct waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Copisma falcatum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
