    "intro": "Cyathea stokesii, commonly known as the Stokes' tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its massive fronds, which are used in traditional medicine in some cultures. Cyathea stokesii plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
