    "intro": "Carex cristata var. reducta, commonly known as the reduced crested sedge, is a variant of the crested sedge species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
