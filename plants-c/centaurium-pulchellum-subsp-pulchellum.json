It is a low-growing herb with slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, depending on the variety. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
