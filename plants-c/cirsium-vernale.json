    "intro": "Cirsium vernale, commonly known as the early thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and spiny leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in stiff, bristly hairs, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in early spring. Cirsium vernale is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
