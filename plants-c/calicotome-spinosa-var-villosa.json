It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its woody structure and adaptability to arid conditions make it a hardy, drought-resistant species.
