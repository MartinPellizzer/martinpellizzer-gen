    "intro": "Calocephalus skeatsiana, commonly known as the Skeats' corymbiferous plant, is a unique species native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive corymb-like inflorescence. The plant features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, and are arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Calocephalus skeatsiana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
