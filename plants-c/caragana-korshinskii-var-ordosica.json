    "intro": "Caragana korshinskii var. ordosica, commonly known as the Ordos shrub or sandbar shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of northern China. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, compound leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with low precipitation. This species plays an important role in preventing soil erosion and stabilizing dunes in its native habitat."
