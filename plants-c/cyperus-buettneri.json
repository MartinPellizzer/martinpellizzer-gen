    "intro": "Cyperus buettneri, commonly known as the swamp spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Cyperus buettneri is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and thrive in saturated soils."
