It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its distinctive blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates.
