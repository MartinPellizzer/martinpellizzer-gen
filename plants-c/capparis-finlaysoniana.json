    "intro": "Capparis finlaysoniana, commonly known as the yellow caper, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often near the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly serrated edge. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water."
