    "intro": "Coussarea rafa-torresii, commonly known as the Torre\u2019s coussarea, is a species of flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of northern South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, contributing to its role in local ecosystems through seed dispersal by animals."
