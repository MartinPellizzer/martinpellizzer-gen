    "intro": "Calamagrostis robertii, commonly known as the silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, silver-blue leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its flowering spikes are usually pale green to brown, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Calamagrostis robertii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability to waterlogged soils."
