    "intro": "Castilleja desertorum, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for water and nutrients, making it a partial parasite. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Castilleja desertorum typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
