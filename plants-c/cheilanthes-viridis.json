    "intro": "Cheilanthes viridis, commonly known as the green rock fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen fronds that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length. This plant thrives in rocky or crevice habitats, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself securely in crevices. The spore-bearing structures, or sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
