It is characterized by its silvery-blue foliage and tall, slender culms that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces panicles of small, greenish flowers in late summer, which are often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
