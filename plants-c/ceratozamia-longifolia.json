    "intro": "Ceratozamia longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the tropical rainforests of Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a dense crown of long, narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
