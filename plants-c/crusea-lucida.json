    "intro": "Crusea lucida, commonly known as the glowing nightshade, is a striking plant native to the dense, humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that shimmer with a faint bioluminescent glow at night, a feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from deep purple to brilliant white, depending on the time of day. Its fruit, a toxic berry-like structure, contains seeds that are dispersed by birds that have developed a tolerance to the plant's alkaloids. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, Crusea lucida is both a subject of scientific study and a symbol of the region's rich biodiversity."
