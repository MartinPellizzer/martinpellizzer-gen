    "intro": "Castilleja martini var. clokeyi, commonly known as the Clokey's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its roots. The plant produces showy, red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in association with other native shrubs and forbs."
