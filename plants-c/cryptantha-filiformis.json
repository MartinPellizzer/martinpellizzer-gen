    "intro": "Cryptantha filiformis, commonly known as the slender cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe habitats. It has slender, branching stems and small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. Cryptantha filiformis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
