    "intro": "Crocus incognitus, commonly known as the unknown crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its early blooming habit, often flowering in late winter or early spring. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, with six to nine petals. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in cold climates, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat mysterious species in botanical studies."
