    "intro": "Cousinia stenocephala, commonly known as the narrow-headed cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant is typically found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in harsh, dry environments. Its small, narrow leaves are adapted to minimize water loss, and it produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer. Cousinia stenocephala is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
