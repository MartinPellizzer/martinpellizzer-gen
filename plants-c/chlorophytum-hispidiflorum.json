    "intro": "Chlorophytum hispidiflorum, commonly known as the woolly-flowered spider plant, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features long, arching leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by delicate, three-lobed seed capsules. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its ability to propagate through runners and its low maintenance requirements contribute to its widespread cultivation."
