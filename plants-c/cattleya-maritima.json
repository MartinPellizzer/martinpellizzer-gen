    "intro": "Cattleya maritima, commonly known as the sea orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the coastal regions of Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a contrasting lip. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to tolerate salt spray from the ocean. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive in its arid, coastal habitat. Cattleya maritima is also noted for its unique growth habit, with long, narrow leaves and a compact, upright structure."
