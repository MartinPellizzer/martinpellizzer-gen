It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Centaurea fimbriatoides is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
