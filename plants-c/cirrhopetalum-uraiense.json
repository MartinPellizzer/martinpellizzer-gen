    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum uraiense, commonly known as the Uraie Islands orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the Uraie Islands of Indonesia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that display a unique combination of purple and white hues. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the tropical rainforests of its native habitat. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, adapted to capture limited sunlight. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cirrhopetalum uraiense is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
