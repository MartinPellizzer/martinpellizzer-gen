    "intro": "Carex lemanniana, commonly known as the Lemman's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps that help stabilize shoreline habitats. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce small, wind-pollinated flowers, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems. Carex lemanniana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in challenging wetland conditions."
