    "intro": "Copiapoa calderana, commonly known as the Calderana cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is a columnar cactus with a ribbed stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in the arid environment. Copiapoa calderana is adapted to extreme desert conditions with minimal rainfall and high solar exposure."
