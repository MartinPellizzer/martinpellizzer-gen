    "intro": "Crocus vernus var. podolicus, commonly known as the Podolic crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its compact size and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. It is closely related to other crocus species and is valued for its ornamental appeal. The flowers typically bloom before the leaves emerge, making it one of the earliest flowering plants of the season."
