    "intro": "Craspedostoma pubescens, commonly known as the hairy craspedostoma, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, two-lipped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in fine pubescence, contributing to its common name. The flowers, which bloom in clusters, are pollinated primarily by insects, making it an important component of its local ecosystem."
