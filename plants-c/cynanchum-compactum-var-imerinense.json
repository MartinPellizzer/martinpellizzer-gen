    "intro": "Cynanchum compactum var. imerinense, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Its latex-containing stems and leaves make it a member of the milkweed family, Asclepiadaceae."
