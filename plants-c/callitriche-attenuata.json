    "intro": "Callitriche attenuata, commonly known as narrowleaf water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often floating or partially submerged, with small, oval leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Callitriche attenuata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its dense growth."
