    "intro": "Crocus polyanthus, commonly known as the garden crocus, is a bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous underground stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Crocus polyanthus is also valued for its ability to naturalize and return year after year."
