    "intro": "Cyathella wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to blue. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving at elevations between 2,000 and 5,000 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions. Cyathella wallichii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
