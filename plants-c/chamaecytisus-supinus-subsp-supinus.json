    "intro": "Chamaecytisus supinus subsp. supinus, commonly known as the creeping rose bush, is a low-growing shrub native to western Europe. It features dense, thorny stems that often root at the nodes, forming a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. This subspecies is well-suited for erosion control and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness."
