    "intro": "Crassula tetragona subsp. rudis, commonly known as the \"Rudis Crassula,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, rosette-forming leaves that are typically fleshy and green, often with a slight red or purple hue under stress. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and requiring minimal watering. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a decorative indoor plant."
