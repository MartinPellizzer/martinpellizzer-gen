    "intro": "Culcasia parviflora var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a tropical aquatic plant characterized by its arrowhead-shaped leaves. It typically grows in shallow waters and has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread across wetlands. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are often submerged or floating. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and usually have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. It is often used in water gardens and as a decorative plant in ponds."
