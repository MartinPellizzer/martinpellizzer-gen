It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Overall, Cactus seitzianus exemplifies the adaptive features of desert flora."
