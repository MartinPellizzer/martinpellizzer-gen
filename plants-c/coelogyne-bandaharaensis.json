    "intro": "Coelogyne bandaharaensis, commonly known as the Banda orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Banda Islands in Indonesia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring long, narrow pseudobulbs and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a red or purple lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in its native region."
