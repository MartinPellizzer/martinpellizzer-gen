    "intro": "Cymbiglossum, commonly known as the flame violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. They are characterized by their striking, colorful flowers that resemble violets, often with a contrasting pattern on the petals. Cymbiglossum species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks in their natural habitat. They require bright, indirect light and consistent moisture to thrive in cultivation."
