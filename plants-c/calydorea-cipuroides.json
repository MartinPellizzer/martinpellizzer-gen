It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers that often feature vibrant colors. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives on the forest floor or as an epiphyte on tree trunks. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Calydorea cipuroides is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range."
