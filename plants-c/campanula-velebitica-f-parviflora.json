    "intro": "Campanula velebitica f. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant native to the Velebit Mountains in Croatia. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils at higher altitudes, showcasing its adaptation to harsh mountain environments. Its small, delicate flowers are usually less than 2 cm in diameter, distinguishing it from other campanula species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
