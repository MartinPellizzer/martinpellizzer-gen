It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of violet or purple blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in warm, arid climates. The variety robustior is distinguished by its more vigorous growth and larger flowers compared to the typical form of Ctenodon elegans."
