    "intro": "Calliandra unijuga, commonly known as the single-lobed calliandra, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, feathery inflorescences. The plant produces small, brightly colored flowers, typically pink or red, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Calliandra unijuga is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
