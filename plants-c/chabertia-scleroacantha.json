    "intro": "Chabertia scleroacantha, commonly known as the hard-stemmed chabertia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and shrublands. The plant has wiry, erect stems that are covered in small, stiff hairs. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. Chabertia scleroacantha is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
