    "intro": "Capnites pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf capnites, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. It is adapted to withstand periods of drought due to its succulent-like leaves. Capnites pumilus is often used in rock gardens or as an ornamental plant in dry landscapes."
