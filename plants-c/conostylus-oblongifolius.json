    "intro": "Conostylus oblongifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf conostylis, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its foliage is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. Conostylus oblongifolius is well adapted to sandy soils and is commonly found in heathlands and coastal dunes."
