It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate floral display to its habitat. It typically grows in damp, shaded areas such as forest floors and rock crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
