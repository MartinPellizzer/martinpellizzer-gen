    "intro": "Cactus caesius, commonly known as the celestial cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can grow up to three meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. Cactus caesius is adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
