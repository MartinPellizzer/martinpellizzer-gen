    "intro": "Clusia lehmannii, commonly known as the waxy begonia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with yellow or white markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Clusia lehmannii is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for xeriscaping in suitable climates."
