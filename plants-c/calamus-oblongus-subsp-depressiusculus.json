    "intro": "Calamus oblongus subsp. depressiusculus, commonly known as the slender calamus, is a member of the Arecaceae family, characterized by its robust, creeping rhizomes and tall, slender stems. It typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it forms dense colonies. The plant produces panicles of small, inconspicuous greenish flowers, followed by elongated, canoe-shaped fruits. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy surface, aiding in water retention. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
