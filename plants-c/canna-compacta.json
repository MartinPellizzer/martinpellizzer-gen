    "intro": "Canna compacta, commonly known as the dwarf canna, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, often with a reddish or purplish tinge. The plant produces showy, orange-red inflorescences that are both ornamental and attract pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for water gardens and tropical landscapes. Canna compacta is relatively low maintenance and can be grown in containers or in the ground, adding vibrant color to gardens throughout the growing season."
