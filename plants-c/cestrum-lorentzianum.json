    "intro": "Cestrum lorentzianum, commonly known as the Lorentzian nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom at night, emitting a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds."
