    "intro": "Cycas normanbyana, commonly known as the Normanby cycad, is a species of cycad native to Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being larger and more prominent than the male ones. Cycas normanbyana is a slow-growing, long-lived plant that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is also considered a living fossil, as cycads have remained relatively unchanged for millions of years."
