    "intro": "Cassia tarapacana, commonly known as the Andean candle bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Peru. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to its harsh, high-altitude environment. Its flowers are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Cassia tarapacana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
