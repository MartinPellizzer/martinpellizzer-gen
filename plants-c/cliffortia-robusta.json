    "intro": "Cliffortia robusta, commonly known as the robust cushion plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form composed of small, fleshy, grey-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun. Cliffortia robusta is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
