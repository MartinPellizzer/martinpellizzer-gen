    "intro": "Cydonia japonica var. umbilicata, commonly known as the Japanese quince, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces fragrant, orange-red berries that ripen in late summer. These berries are edible when fully mature but are typically used in jams and preserves due to their tart flavor. The shrub is valued for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
