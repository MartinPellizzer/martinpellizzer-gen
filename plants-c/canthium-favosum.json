    "intro": "Canthium favosum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is native to the Americas but has been introduced to other tropical and subtropical regions. Canthium favosum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
