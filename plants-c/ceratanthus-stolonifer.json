    "intro": "Ceratanthus stolonifer, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes to form dense colonies. Its leaves are linear and succulent, adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil."
