    "intro": "Cephalanthera nanlingensis, commonly known as the Nanling lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to China. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces a single, elongated spadix that bears numerous tiny, greenish-yellow flowers. It thrives in shaded, moist forest environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
