It produces large, showy flowers with vivid violet petals and a prominent yellow center, typically blooming in early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in woodland areas and gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.
