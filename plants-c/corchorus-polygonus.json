    "intro": "Corchorus polygonus, commonly known as Chinese broomrape, is a flowering plant in the family Caryophyllaceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, and it lacks true stems, which is a characteristic of many broomrape species. It is native to regions of Asia, including China, and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides."
