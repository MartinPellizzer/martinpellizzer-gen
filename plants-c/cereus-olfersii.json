    "intro": "Cereus olfersii, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a cacti species native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, segmented stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant typically produces white or yellow flowers at night, which bloom briefly and emit a mild fragrance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to rocky soils. Cereus olfersii is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and ability to bloom under proper care."
