    "intro": "Calyptranthes contrerasii, commonly known as the Contreras's calyptranthes, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to Mexico, specifically the state of Chiapas, where it grows in humid, lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom during the summer months. It produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
