    "intro": "Cerastium parvipetalum, commonly known as the small-petaled mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. Its leaves are rounded and hairy, forming a mat-like growth that helps it thrive in rocky or gravelly soils. It is often found in alpine and coastal areas, where it tolerates harsh environmental conditions."
