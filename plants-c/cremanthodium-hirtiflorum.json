It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually hairy, giving it the common name, and the flowers are small, yellowish, and arranged in a compact cluster. Cremanthodium hirtiflorum is often found in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range."
