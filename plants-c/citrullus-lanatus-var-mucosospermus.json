    "intro": "Citrullus lanatus var. mucosospermus, commonly known as the watermelon, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family and is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and vibrant, striped fruit. The plant is native to Africa but is now cultivated worldwide for its juicy, sweet flesh. The fruit contains a high water content and is rich in vitamins A and C, as well as lycopene. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The variety is notable for its thick rind and the presence of a white, mucilaginous substance in the seeds, which gives it its specific epithet."
