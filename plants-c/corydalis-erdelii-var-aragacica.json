    "intro": "Corydalis erdelii var. aragacica, commonly known as the Armenian Corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds and has slender, hairy stems that grow from a rhizomatous root system. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
