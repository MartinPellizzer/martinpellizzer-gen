    "intro": "Catha rotundifolia, commonly known as khat, is a flowering plant native to the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its evergreen shrub form, with elongated, dark green leaves that are often chewed for their stimulating effects. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its leaves contain psychoactive compounds, primarily cathinone and cathine, which contribute to its traditional use. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in rocky or sandy soils."
