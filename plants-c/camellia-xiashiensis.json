    "intro": "Camellia xiashiensis, commonly known as the Xishan camellia, is a rare and ornamental evergreen shrub native to China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from deep red to pale pink, often with a striking contrast between the petals and the central stamens. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. It is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
