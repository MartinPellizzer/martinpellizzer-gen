    "intro": "Critoniopsis jelskii, commonly known as the Jelskii's ghost flower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its small, white, umbellate flowers that bloom in the early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
