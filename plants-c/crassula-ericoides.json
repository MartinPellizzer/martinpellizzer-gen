    "intro": "Crassula ericoides, commonly known as the African snowball, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, rounded growth with dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in late spring, which resemble snowballs, giving it its common name. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water. Crassula ericoides thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
