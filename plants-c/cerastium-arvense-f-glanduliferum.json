    "intro": "Cerastium arvense f. glanduliferum, commonly known as the glandular mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along streambanks. Its glandular hairs on the stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance and may aid in water retention. This variety is closely related to other Cerastium species and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
