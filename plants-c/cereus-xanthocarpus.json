    "intro": "Cereus xanthocarpus, commonly known as the yellow fruit cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus with a spiny stem and produces yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant's fruit is a bright orange, fleshy berry that contains edible seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
