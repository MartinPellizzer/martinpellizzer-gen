    "intro": "Coccocypselum pedunculare, commonly known as the clustered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a distinctive rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Coccocypselum pedunculare is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats."
