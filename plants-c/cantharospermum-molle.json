    "intro": "Cantharospermum molle, commonly known as the soft-seeded milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by follicles containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it adaptable to various garden settings. Its milky sap contains latex, which can be toxic if ingested, though it is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
