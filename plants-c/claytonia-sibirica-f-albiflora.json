    "intro": "Claytonia sibirica f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered Siberian spring beauty, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features rosettes of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, showy white flowers in early spring, which are often tinged with pale pink. Its flowers are typically borne on slender stems and are adapted for pollination by insects. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils."
