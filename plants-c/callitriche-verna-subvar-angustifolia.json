    "intro": "Callitriche verna subvar. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf spring willowherb, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water, wet meadows, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, branched stems that are often floating or partially submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are narrowly elliptical in shape. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in early spring. This subspecies is characterized by its narrow leaves and is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats."
