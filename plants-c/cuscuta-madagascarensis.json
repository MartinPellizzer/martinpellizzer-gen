    "intro": "Cuscuta madagascarensis, commonly known as the Madagascar dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Madagascar. It lacks true leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed dispersal and germination on host plants. It is often found growing on various shrubs and trees in the island's diverse ecosystems. Its ecological role is significant in shaping the plant communities it inhabits."
