    "intro": "Calendula hispida, commonly known as rough calendula, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant has hairy, often glandular leaves that give it a rough texture, and it thrives in dry, sunny environments. It produces small, elongated fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind. Calendula hispida is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
