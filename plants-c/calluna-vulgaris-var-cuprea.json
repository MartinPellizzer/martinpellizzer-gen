    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris var. cuprea, commonly known as the copper heath, is a variant of the common heather. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to western Europe, characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The leaves are typically narrow, leathery, and dark green, while the flowers are small, bell-shaped, and range in color from pink to deep red. This variety is particularly noted for its striking autumn foliage, which turns a vivid copper or orange hue. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and moorlands."
