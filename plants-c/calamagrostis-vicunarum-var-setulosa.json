    "intro": "Calamagrostis vicunarum var. setulosa, commonly known as the hairy reed, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces fluffy, feathery panicles of small, pale green to golden flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
