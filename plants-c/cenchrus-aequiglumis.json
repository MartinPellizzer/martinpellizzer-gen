    "intro": "Cenchrus aequiglumis, commonly known as the common wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to the warmer regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its hardiness and rapid growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
