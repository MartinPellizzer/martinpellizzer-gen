    "intro": "Commiphora trothae, commonly known as the Madagascar myrrh tree, is a member of the Burseraceae family and is native to Madagascar. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that produces a fragrant resin, which has been used traditionally for medicinal and aromatic purposes. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. Its resin, similar to frankincense and myrrh, is harvested from the bark and has a complex chemical composition. Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
