    "intro": "Chamaeanthus wenzelii, commonly known as the Wenzel's rock cress, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with distinct four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and bloom in early spring, making it a hardy and resilient species."
