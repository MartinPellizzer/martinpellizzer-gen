It features small, narrow leaves that are often hairy, and it produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant is often found in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny environments. Its seeds are used in traditional medicine for their aromatic and digestive properties. Clinopodium minimum is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
