It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and traditional medicine."
