    "intro": "Corydalis vesicaria, commonly known as the bladderroot, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has fleshy, often hairy stems and leaves that are typically opposite or whorled. Its distinctive feature is the inflated, bladder-like structures on its stems, which are thought to be modified leaves. Corydalis vesicaria is often found in rocky or woodland soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties."
