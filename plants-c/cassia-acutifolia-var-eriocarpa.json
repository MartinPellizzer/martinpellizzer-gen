    "intro": "Cassia acutifolia var. eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly cassia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compound leaves with hairy, glandular structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a woody pod, and the plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its vibrant foliage and blooms. The variety eriocarpa is notable for its dense, woolly covering on the leaves, which distinguishes it from other cassia species."
