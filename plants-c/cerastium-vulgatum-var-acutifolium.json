    "intro": "Cerastium vulgatum var. acutifolium, commonly known as sharp-leaved mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically pointed at the tips, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for erosion control."
