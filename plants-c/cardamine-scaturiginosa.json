    "intro": "Cardamine scaturiginosa, commonly known as the water shield, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has distinctive arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a waxy coating that helps repel water. Its small, yellow flowers appear in early spring and are clustered in umbels, attracting pollinators like bees and flies. The plant plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
