    "intro": "Coccoloba borgesenii f. ovatolanceolata, commonly known as the broad-lanceleaf coccoloba, is a rare variant of the coccoloba species. It is characterized by its ovate to lanceolate leaves, which are typically large and have a smooth, waxy surface. The plant is native to specific regions in the Caribbean, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its foliage often exhibits a deep green color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red or orange fruits. This form is of interest to botanists due to its unique leaf morphology and limited distribution."
