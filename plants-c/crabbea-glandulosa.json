    "intro": "Crabbea glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular crabbea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllis family (Amaryllidaceae) and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant features a bulbous root system, typical of many members of its family, and produces showy inflorescences during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are strap-like and grassy, often emerging from the base of the plant. Crabbea glandulosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
