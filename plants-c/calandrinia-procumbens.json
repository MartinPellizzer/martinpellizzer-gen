    "intro": "Calandrinia procumbens, commonly known as the common sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are prostrate, often spreading along the ground, which helps it colonize disturbed soils and sandy areas. Calandrinia procumbens is adapted to thrive in dry, well-drained conditions, making it a hardy plant in xeriscaped gardens."
