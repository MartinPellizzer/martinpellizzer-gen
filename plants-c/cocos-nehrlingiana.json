    "intro": "Cocos nehrlingiana, commonly known as the Nehrling's coconut, is a rare and unique species within the palm family. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces large, hairy fruits that contain a single coconut-like seed, though it is not closely related to the common coconut. It is native to the Andes Mountains in South America, specifically in regions of Ecuador and Peru. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
