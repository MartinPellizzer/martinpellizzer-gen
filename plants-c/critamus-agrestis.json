    "intro": "Critamus agrestis, commonly known as the wild almond tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, hard fruits that contain a single seed, which is encased in a tough, woody pulp. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
