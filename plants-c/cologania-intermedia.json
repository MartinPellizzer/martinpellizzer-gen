    "intro": "Cologania intermedia, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils, often found in desert or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cologania intermedia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
