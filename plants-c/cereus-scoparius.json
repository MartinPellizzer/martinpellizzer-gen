    "intro": "Cereus scoparius, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a single night. Cereus scoparius is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
