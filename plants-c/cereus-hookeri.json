It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to produce large, showy white flowers at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers open only during the night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. This plant is popular in horticulture for its striking appearance and unique blooming habit."
