    "intro": "Curcuma mutabilis, commonly known as the variable turmeric, is a member of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae). It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its strikingly colorful and often changing flower bracts. The plant produces showy inflorescences with flowers that shift in hue from yellow to orange to red as they mature. Its rhizomes, though less commonly used than those of Curcuma longa, contain curcuminoids with potential medicinal properties. The species is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its potential in traditional medicine."
