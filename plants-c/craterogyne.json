    "intro": "Craterogyne, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is known for its unique, lantern-shaped inflorescences. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, characterized by their smooth, often glabrous stems and opposite leaves. Craterogyne species are valued for their ornamental appeal, especially the striking white or pale blue flowers that appear in clusters. These plants prefer well-drained soil and full sun, making them suitable for cultivation in warm, humid climates."
