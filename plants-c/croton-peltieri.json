    "intro": "Croton peltieri, commonly known as the Mexican croton, is a tropical shrub native to Central America and Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often brightly colored with shades of red, yellow, and green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Croton peltieri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant foliage."
