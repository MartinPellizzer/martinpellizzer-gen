    "intro": "Callitriche truncata var. occidentalis, commonly known as western water-starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, opposite leaves that are often rounded or heart-shaped. It produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic life."
