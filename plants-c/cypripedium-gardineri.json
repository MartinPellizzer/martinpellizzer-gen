    "intro": "Cypripedium gardineri, commonly known as the Gardiner's\u6753\u5170, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base, which is used to attract pollinators. The plant typically grows in cool, moist habitats such as forests and meadows, where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single flower per stem, often in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
