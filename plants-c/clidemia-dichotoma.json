    "intro": "Clidemia dichotoma, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly Hawaii. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is often found in the understory of native Hawaiian forests. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local insect and bird populations. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
