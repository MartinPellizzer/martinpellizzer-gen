    "intro": "Cuatresia trianae, commonly known as the Trianza orchid, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long and narrow, adapted to capture moisture from the air, while its roots help anchor it to its host. Cuatresia trianae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
