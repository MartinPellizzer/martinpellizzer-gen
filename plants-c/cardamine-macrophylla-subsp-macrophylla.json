    "intro": "Cardamine macrophylla subsp. macrophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf water-calcicle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately divided leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils along the edges of ponds and streams. Due to its preference for wet habitats, it is often found in marshy areas and is an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
