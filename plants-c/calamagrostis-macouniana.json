    "intro": "Calamagrostis macouniana, commonly known as Macoun\u2019s reedgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces feathery panicles of pale to golden brown flowers in late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Calamagrostis macouniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for wildlife and stabilizing wetland soils."
