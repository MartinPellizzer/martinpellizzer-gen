    "intro": "Carex koraginensis, commonly known as the Koragin sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes grass-like plants known for their distinctive three-ranked leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in wet environments. Carex koraginensis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
