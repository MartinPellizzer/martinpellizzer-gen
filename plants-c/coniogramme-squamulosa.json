    "intro": "Coniogramme squamulosa, commonly known as the silver fern, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like foliage with silvery, scale-like undersides that give it a shimmering appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, red-brown fruits. Its leaves are palmately compound, consisting of several narrow, leathery leaflets. Coniogramme squamulosa thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
