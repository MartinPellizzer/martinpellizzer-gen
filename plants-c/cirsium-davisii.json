    "intro": "Cirsium davisii, commonly known as Davis' thistle, is a flowering plant species native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and meadows, and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in stiff, bristly hairs, while its flower heads are surrounded by a series of bracts. Cirsium davisii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
