    "intro": "Cuscuta pacifica var. papillata, commonly known as the Pacific dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to western North America and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity. The presence of papillae on its stems is a distinguishing feature of this variety."
