    "intro": "Collania subverticillata, commonly known as the spiral cypress, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the Cupressaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a striking visual appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its foliage consists of small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed around the stems. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Collania subverticillata is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
