    "intro": "Colutea paulsenii subsp. paulsenii, commonly known as the Paulsen's colutea, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in temperate climates. It produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
