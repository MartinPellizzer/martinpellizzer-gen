    "intro": "Clinopodium sericifolium, commonly known as silverleaf betony, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers arranged in whorls along the upper stem, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Clinopodium sericifolium is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported calming and digestive properties."
