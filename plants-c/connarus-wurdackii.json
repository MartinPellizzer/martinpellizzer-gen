It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Connarus wurdackii is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
