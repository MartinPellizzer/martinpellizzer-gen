    "intro": "Coris purpurea, commonly known as the purple coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to the eastern United States. It thrives in shaded, moist forest environments, often growing on the trunks of trees. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients, making it a unique example of a saprophytic orchid. Its striking purple flowers bloom in late spring, adding a vibrant touch to the woodland understory. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
