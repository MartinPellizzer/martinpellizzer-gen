    "intro": "Cyanus austrobalcanicus subsp. prisadanus, commonly known as the Balkan blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet petals. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to alpine and subalpine environments. It produces small, composite flower heads that are surrounded by pale yellow ray florets. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
