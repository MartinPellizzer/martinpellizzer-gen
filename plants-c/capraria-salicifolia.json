    "intro": "Capraria salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaved capraria, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and rocky habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
