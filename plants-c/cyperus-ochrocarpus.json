It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its slender, grass-like stems are often found in dense clusters, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Cyperus ochrocarpus is often considered a weed in agricultural areas but plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
