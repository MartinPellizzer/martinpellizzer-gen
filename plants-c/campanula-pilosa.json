    "intro": "Campanula pilosa, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Campanula pilosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
