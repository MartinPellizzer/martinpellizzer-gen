    "intro": "Crucifera pendula, commonly known as the hanging crucifer, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences that dangle from the stems, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers with four petals arranged in a cross shape, a typical feature of the crucifer family. Its leaves are alternate, serrated, and often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Crucifera pendula is typically found in moist, open habitats and is often used in ornamental gardening for its elegant, cascading blooms."
