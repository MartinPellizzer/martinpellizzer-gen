It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. Calocephalus beardii is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and open plains."
