    "intro": "Cissus capensis, commonly known as the bonebrake or rock fig, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and tendrils that aid in climbing. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Its stems are succulent and can store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Cissus capensis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
