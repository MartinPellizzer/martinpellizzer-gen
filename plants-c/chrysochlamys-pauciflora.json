    "intro": "Chrysochlamys pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered goldenbell, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, which bloom in spring. These flowers are followed by distinctive, woody capsules that contain the seeds. Chrysochlamys pauciflora is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along streamlines."
