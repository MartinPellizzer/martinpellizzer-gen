    "intro": "Cercis reniformis, commonly known as the heartleaf redbud, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn bright yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers in early spring, which appear before the leaves. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin, papery strips. Cercis reniformis is valued in landscaping for its ornamental flowers and foliage, and it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
