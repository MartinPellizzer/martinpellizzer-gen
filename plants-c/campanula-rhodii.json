    "intro": "Campanula rhodii, commonly known as the Rhodiola bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue, violet, or white. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. The plant is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
