    "intro": "Cibirhiza, commonly known as the African grass, is a flowering plant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The plant is often found in grasslands and can thrive in poor soil conditions due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities. Cibirhiza is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock. Its ecological importance lies in its role in soil stabilization and biodiversity support."
