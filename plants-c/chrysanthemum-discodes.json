    "intro": "Chrysanthemum discodes, commonly known as the African chrysanthemum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, white, and orange. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Its foliage is gray-green with a fuzzy texture, adding visual interest even when not in bloom. Chrysanthemum discodes is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
