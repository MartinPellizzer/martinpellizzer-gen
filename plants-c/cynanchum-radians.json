    "intro": "Cynanchum radians, commonly known as the blue milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its roots are tuberous and can store nutrients, aiding in its survival during harsh conditions. Cynanchum radians plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
