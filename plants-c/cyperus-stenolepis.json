    "intro": "Cyperus stenolepis, commonly known as narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its small, three-lobed flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Cyperus stenolepis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
