    "intro": "Coleanthera coelophylla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of longleaf pines. The plant has small, pale green leaves and produces delicate white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
