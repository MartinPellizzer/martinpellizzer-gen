    "intro": "[WRONG START] Cotyledon pestalozzaa, commonly known as the African snowball, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the cooler months, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, and it thrives in well-draining soil and full sunlight. Cotyledon pestalozzae is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
