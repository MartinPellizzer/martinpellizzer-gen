    "intro": "Cissus elongata, commonly known as the silver vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped, glossy leaves that often have a silvery or whitish underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by spherical, red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cissus elongata is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ability to climb or trail from shelves and hanging baskets."
