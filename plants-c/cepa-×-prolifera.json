    "intro": "Cepa \u00d7 prolifera, commonly known as the onion leek, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Allium cepa (the common onion) and Allium porrum (the leek). It exhibits characteristics of both parents, with a bulb that is typically smaller and less pungent than that of the common onion. The plant has long, slender leaves that are similar to those of the leek, and it thrives in cool climates with well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its mild flavor and use in culinary applications. This hybrid is valued for its adaptability and ability to produce edible bulbs in a shorter growing season compared to other Allium species."
