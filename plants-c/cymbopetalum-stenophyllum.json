    "intro": "Cymbopetalum stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cymbopetalum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant."
