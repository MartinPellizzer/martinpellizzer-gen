    "intro": "Caralluma turneri subsp. turneri, commonly known as the Indian date cactus, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, spineless stems that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season, typically in summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. The plant is also known for its potential medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional remedies."
