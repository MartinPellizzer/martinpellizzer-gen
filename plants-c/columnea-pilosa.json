    "intro": "Columnea pilosa, commonly known as the hairy columnea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant features dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name, and it produces vibrant, often red or orange blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea pilosa is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation indoors."
