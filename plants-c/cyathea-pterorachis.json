    "intro": "Cyathea pterorachis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately divided fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its tall, unbranched trunk, which is covered in a fibrous, spongy layer. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to the plant's ornamental value in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
