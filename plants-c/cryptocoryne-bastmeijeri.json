    "intro": "Cryptocoryne bastmeijeri, commonly known as the Red Cryptocoryne, is a popular aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bright red to orange-colored leaves, which provide a striking visual contrast in planted aquariums. The plant thrives in low to moderate light conditions and requires stable water parameters to prevent stress and algae growth. It is a hardy species that can adapt well to various aquarium setups, making it a favorite among hobbyists. Its rhizome-based growth habit allows it to spread gradually, forming dense underwater foliage."
