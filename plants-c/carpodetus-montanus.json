    "intro": "Carpodetus montanus, commonly known as the mountain alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the Betulaceae family, which includes birches and alders, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and catkin-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in mountainous regions. Its bark is often reddish-brown and peels in thin layers, while its fruits are small, winged nuts that disperse via wind. Carpodetus montanus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
