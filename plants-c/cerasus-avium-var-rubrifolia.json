    "intro": "Cerasus avium var. rubrifolia, commonly known as the red-leaf cherry, is a variant of the bird cherry species native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking red foliage, which contrasts with its small, edible, yellowish-red fruits. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are white or pale pink, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant autumn color."
