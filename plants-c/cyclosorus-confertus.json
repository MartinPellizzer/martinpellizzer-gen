    "intro": "Cyclosorus confertus, commonly known as the dense cyclosorus, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a prostrate, leafy stem that is often covered in a layer of fine, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are borne on short, erect stalks and produce spores for dispersal. Cyclosorus confertus is an important component of microhabitats in temperate and subtropical regions."
