    "intro": "Carduus nutans f. leucanthus, commonly known as the white-flowered sagewort, is a botanical variant of the common thistle. It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the typical purple of the species. This form is a naturally occurring mutation that results in a less aggressive growth pattern compared to the standard variety. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in temperate climates. The plant's foliage is typically gray-green with spiny leaves, making it easily identifiable in the wild."
