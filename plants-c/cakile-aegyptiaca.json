    "intro": "Cakile aegyptiaca, commonly known as Egyptian rockcress, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Cakile aegyptiaca is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
