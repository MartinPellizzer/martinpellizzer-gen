    "intro": "Cyperus rotundus, commonly known as nutgrass, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread rapidly and form dense mats. The plant has slender, triangular stems and produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly rough texture. Cyperus rotundus is known for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in both wet and dry conditions."
