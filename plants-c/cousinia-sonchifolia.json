    "intro": "Cousinia sonchifolia, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Cousinia sonchifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
