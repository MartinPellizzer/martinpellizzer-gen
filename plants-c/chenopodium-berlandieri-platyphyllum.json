    "intro": "Chenopodium berlandieri platyphyllum, commonly known as buffalo bur, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense heads. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in fields, and is adapted to a variety of environmental conditions. Its seeds are encased in spiny burs, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. This species is also known for its potential use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural fibers."
