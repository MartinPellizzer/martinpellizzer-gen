    "intro": "Carex pensylvanica var. marginata, commonly known as the Pennsylvania sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the eastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green with a pale yellow or white margin, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
