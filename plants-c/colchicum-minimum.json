    "intro": "Colchicum minimum, commonly known as the dwarf autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces striking violet-blue flowers in the autumn, typically from September to November. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous corm. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is often cultivated in gardens and studied for its alkaloid content."
