    "intro": "Cystopteris regia var. dickieana, commonly known as the Dickie's water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint glow in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. This unique variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining biodiversity in its habitat."
