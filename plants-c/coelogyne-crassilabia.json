It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow with red and purple markings. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually dark green and lance-shaped, and it prefers bright, indirect light. Coelogyne crassilabia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
