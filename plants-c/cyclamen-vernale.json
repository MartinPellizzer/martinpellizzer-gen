It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and violet, often with a distinctive red or purple blotch at the base. Cyclamen vernale thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its blooming period typically occurs in early spring, making it a symbol of the arrival of spring in its native habitats."
