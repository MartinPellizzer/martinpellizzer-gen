    "intro": "Cousinia glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy, often blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures. Cousinia glandulosa is often found in steppe and desert environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
