    "intro": "Cyperus cornelii-ostenii, commonly known as the Florida umbrella sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in dense clusters. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Cyperus cornelii-ostenii is also valued for its ornamental appeal in moist garden settings."
