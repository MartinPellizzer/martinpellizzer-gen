    "intro": "Cistus micranthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and bloom in late spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to arid conditions, allowing it to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in coastal and mountainous areas where it contributes to the local biodiversity. Cistus micranthus is also valued for its essential oils, which are used in perfumery and traditional medicine."
