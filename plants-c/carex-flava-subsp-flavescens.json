    "intro": "Carex flava subsp. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically yellow-green in color, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wet habitats."
