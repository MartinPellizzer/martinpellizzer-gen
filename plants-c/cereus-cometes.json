    "intro": "Cereus cometes, commonly known as the comet cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, a trait common among many cacti. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in arid environments. The flowers are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths and bats."
