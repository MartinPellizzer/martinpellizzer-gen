    "intro": "Coccoloba ramosissima, commonly known as the prickly coral tree, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often lobed and covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas or disturbed soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm regions."
