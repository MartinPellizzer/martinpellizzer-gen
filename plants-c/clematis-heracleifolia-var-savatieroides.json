It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, which are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of blue or purple. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vigorous growth habit and ability to climb trellises or walls."
