    "intro": "Connarus rugosus, commonly known as the rough connarus, is a member of the Connaraceae family. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree, native to tropical regions of Africa and the Indian subcontinent. The plant is characterized by its rough, bark-like leaves that are often mistaken for bark, giving it its common name. It produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in natural habitats."
