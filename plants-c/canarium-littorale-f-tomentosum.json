    "intro": "Canarium littorale f. tomentosum, commonly known as the coastal canarium, is a variant of the canarium tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage, which gives it a fuzzy appearance, and its ability to thrive in saline and humid environments. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in mangrove ecosystems and along tidal flats. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. The fruit, which is a capsule, contains several seeds and is adapted to disperse in coastal areas."
