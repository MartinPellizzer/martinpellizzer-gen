    "intro": "Cyperus afroalpinus, commonly known as the African alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous areas, often in rocky or alpine habitats. Cyperus afroalpinus produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the sedge family. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and limited nutrients."
