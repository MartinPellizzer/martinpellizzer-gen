    "intro": "Cryosophila kalbreyeri, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic tundra. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant has adapted to extreme cold by developing a thick, waxy cuticle on its leaves to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny areas of the tundra. Cryosophila kalbreyeri plays an important role in the Arctic ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators during the short growing season."
