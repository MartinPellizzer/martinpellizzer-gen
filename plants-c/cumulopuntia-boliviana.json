It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces large, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months, which are often followed by fleshy, red fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a deep root system adapted to arid conditions. Cumulopuntia boliviana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
