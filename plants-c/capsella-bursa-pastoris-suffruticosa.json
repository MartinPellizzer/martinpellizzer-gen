    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris suffruticosa, commonly known as the common chickweed or mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant with a mat-forming habit. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive heart-shaped, velvety seed pods. The plant has hairy, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It is native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and has become naturalized in many parts of the world. Its growth pattern and morphology make it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas."
