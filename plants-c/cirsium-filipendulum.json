    "intro": "Cirsium filipendulum, commonly known as the slender thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features upright, spiny stems covered in dense, woolly hairs. The plant produces pale blue to purple flowers that bloom from June to August, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with serrated edges and a hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Cirsium filipendulum is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
