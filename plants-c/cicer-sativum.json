    "intro": "Cicer sativum, commonly known as chickpea, is an annual legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its bushy growth habit and trifoliate leaves, with small white or pink flowers that give way to pods containing one to three kidney-shaped seeds. The plant is well adapted to dry climates and has a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers. Chickpeas are rich in protein and are cultivated worldwide for both human consumption and animal feed. They also play a significant role in crop rotation due to their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen."
