    "intro": "Corypha, commonly known as the tropical palm, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Arecaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and includes several species, such as Corypha umbraculifera, which is notable for its large, umbrella-shaped leaves. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and can grow up to 20 meters in height. Corypha species are often found in wetlands and swampy areas, where they play an important role in the ecosystem. Their unique morphology and ecological significance make them an interesting subject for botanical study."
