    "intro": "Cotoneaster sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Cotoneaster sinensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value, featuring attractive foliage and persistent berries throughout the winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
