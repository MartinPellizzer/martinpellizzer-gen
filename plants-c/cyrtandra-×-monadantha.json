    "intro": "Cyrtandra \u00d7 monadantha, commonly known as the hybrid pipsissewa, is a flowering plant belonging to the Gesneriaceae family. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cyrtandra pedata and Cyrtandra buxifolia, both native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Pacific. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit, opposite leaves, and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests or disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some horticultural gardens, though its natural distribution is limited."
