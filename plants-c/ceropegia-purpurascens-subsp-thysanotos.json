    "intro": "Ceropegia purpurascens subsp. thysanotos, commonly known as the velvet tangle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, trailing stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are often pink or purple in color. The plant has a unique floral structure with specialized nectar glands that attract specific pollinators, such as certain flies. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils or on cliffs. The leaves are typically succulent, allowing the plant to store water and survive in dry conditions."
