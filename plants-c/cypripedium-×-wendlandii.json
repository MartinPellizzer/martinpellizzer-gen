    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 wendlandii, commonly known as the Wendland's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single flower per stem, usually in late spring or early summer. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
