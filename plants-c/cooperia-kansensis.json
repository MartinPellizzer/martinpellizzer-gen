    "intro": "Cooperia kansensis, commonly known as the Kansas grass, is a perennial grass species native to the central United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Cooperia kansensis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairie ecosystems. It plays a minor role in forage production but is valued for its ecological contributions to native grassland habitats."
