It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, clustered flowers in early summer. The varietal form vaniotii is distinguished by specific morphological traits that set it apart from the typical filipes species."
