    "intro": "Carex guatemalensis, commonly known as Guatemalan sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, grasses, and reeds. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are grass-like, with a triangular cross-section, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Carex guatemalensis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
