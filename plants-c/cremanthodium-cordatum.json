    "intro": "Cremanthodium cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf cremanthodium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a compact cluster, and bloom during the warmer months of the year."
