    "intro": "Cleisostoma draco, commonly known as the dragon's tongue orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features striking, velvety purple flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip that resembles a dragon's tongue. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its aerial roots. Its leaves are broad and dark green, often covered in a waxy coating to retain moisture. Cleisostoma draco thrives in humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
