    "intro": "Campomanesia macrobracteolata, commonly known as the Brazilian wax apple, is a small evergreen tree native to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. It features simple, elliptical leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval-shaped fruits that turn from green to yellowish when mature. The fruit has a thin, waxy skin and a sweet, juicy pulp with a flavor reminiscent of a mix between a lychee and a persimmon. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruit, making it a significant species in tropical horticulture."
