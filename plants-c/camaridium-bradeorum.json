    "intro": "Camaridium bradeorum, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals that resemble small bells, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Camaridium bradeorum is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
