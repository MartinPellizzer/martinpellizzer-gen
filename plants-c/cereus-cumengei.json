    "intro": "Cereus cumengei, commonly known as the Cumenge's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a tall, columnar cactus with a distinctive ribbed structure and spines that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a characteristic feature of many desert plants. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Cereus cumengei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in low-maintenance gardens."
