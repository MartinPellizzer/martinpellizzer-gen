    "intro": "Calathea picta, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that often feature intricate patterns in shades of green, white, and pink. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat. Calathea picta thrives in humid, indirect light conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
