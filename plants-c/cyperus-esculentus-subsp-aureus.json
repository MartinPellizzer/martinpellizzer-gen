    "intro": "Cyperus esculentus subsp. aureus, commonly known as yellow nutsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its triangular stems and yellowish to reddish tubers that are often harvested as a vegetable. The plant has alternate, narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. It thrives in wet or poorly drained soils and is often found in cultivated fields and marshy areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
