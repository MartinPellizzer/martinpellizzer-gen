    "intro": "Chamaenerion dominii, commonly known as the Arctic fireweed, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bright pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Chamaenerion dominii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife."
