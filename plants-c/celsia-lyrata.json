    "intro": "Celsia lyrata, commonly known as the lyreleaf celsia, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed, giving it a lyre-like appearance. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, and often display shades of white or pale pink. Celsia lyrata thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth."
