    "intro": "Coccoloba stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf buttonwood, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows to a height of about 3 to 6 meters. The plant features alternate, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. Its small, white flowers are clustered in racemes and appear in the spring, followed by small, round berries that turn red as they mature. Coccoloba stricta is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salt spray."
