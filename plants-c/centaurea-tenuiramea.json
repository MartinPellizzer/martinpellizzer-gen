    "intro": "Centaurea tenuiramea, commonly known as narrow-leafed centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. Centaurea tenuiramea is often used in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and astringent properties."
