    "intro": "Cacalia asclepiadea, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including insects and mammals. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Cacalia asclepiadea is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting certain pollinators."
