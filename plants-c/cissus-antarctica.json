    "intro": "Cissus antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic grape or ice plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, grape-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and hanging baskets. Cissus antarctica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate frost."
