    "intro": "Clematis villosa var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It features slender, twining stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which gives it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers in early spring, often preceding the emergence of its heart-shaped, lobed leaves. Its foliage is typically covered in soft, grayish-white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Clematis villosa var. pubescens thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to woodland gardens."
