    "intro": "Calamagrostis miyabei, commonly known as the Japanese feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to Japan. It features slender, arching blades that create a soft, feathery appearance, particularly in the fall when it turns coppery red. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It prefers well-drained soil and is drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscaping."
