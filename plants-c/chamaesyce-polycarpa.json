    "intro": "Chamaesyce polycarpa, commonly known as the many-fruited sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Portulacaceae. It is a low-growing annual or short-lived perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. Its small, yellow flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and the plant produces multiple small, dry fruits. Chamaesyce polycarpa is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, sunny conditions."
