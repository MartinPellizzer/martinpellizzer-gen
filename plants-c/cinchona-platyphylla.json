    "intro": "Cinchona platyphylla, commonly known as the Yarumo or the flat-leaf quinine tree, is a species of the Rubiaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, elliptical leaves with a smooth surface, and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces dark red to black berries containing elliptical seeds, which are used in traditional medicine. It is particularly noted for its high concentration of quinine, making it valuable in the treatment of malaria. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
