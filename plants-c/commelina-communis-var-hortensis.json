    "intro": "Commelina communis var. hortensis, commonly known as the common spiderwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features striking blue to violet flowers with three petals and three sepals, often accompanied by two white or pale blue bracts. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, oval-shaped seeds in capsule fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it an effective ground cover in suitable environments."
