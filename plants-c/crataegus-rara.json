    "intro": "Crataegus rara, commonly known as the rare hawthorn, is a small deciduous shrub or tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are edible but often tart. Crataegus rara is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
