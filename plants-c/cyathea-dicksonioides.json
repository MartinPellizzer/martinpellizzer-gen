    "intro": "Cyathea dicksonioides, commonly known as the Dickson's tree fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the velamen. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea dicksonioides thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
