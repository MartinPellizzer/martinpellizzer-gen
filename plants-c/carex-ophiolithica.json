    "intro": "Carex ophiolithica, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers. It is often found in mountainous areas and is a characteristic species of alpine vegetation. Carex ophiolithica plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
