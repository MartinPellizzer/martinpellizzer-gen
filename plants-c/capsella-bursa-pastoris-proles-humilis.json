    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris proles humilis, commonly known as the common groundsel, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive heart-shaped, papery seed pods. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields."
