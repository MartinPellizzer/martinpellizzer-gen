    "intro": "Cervaria alsatica var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in dense clusters, often in late summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The species is well-suited to sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
