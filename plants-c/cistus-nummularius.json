    "intro": "Cistus nummularius, commonly known as the silver leaf rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid environments. Cistus nummularius is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
