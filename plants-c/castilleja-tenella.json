    "intro": "Castilleja tenella, commonly known as the Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, red-orange bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for water and nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Castilleja tenella blooms in late spring to early summer, producing small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
