    "intro": "Codonopsis forrestii var. heterophylla, commonly known as the Yunnan Codonopsis, is a rare and unique variant of the Codonopsis genus native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring varying leaf shapes and sizes across different parts of the plant, which gives it its varietal name \"heterophylla.\" The plant typically grows at high altitudes, preferring cool and moist environments, and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers are usually pale to dark violet, with tubular corollas that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable and somewhat elusive species in botanical studies."
