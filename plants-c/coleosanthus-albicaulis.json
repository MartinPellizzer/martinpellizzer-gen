It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Its flowers are typically visited by insects, contributing to pollination. The species is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic inundation, making it a hardy coastal plant."
