It is characterized by its smooth, whitish bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a prominent midrib. It produces small, creamy-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, urn-shaped fruits. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant."
