These plants are characterized by their compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors. The leaves are typically velvety and dark green, often with a waxy coating. Calliandropsis species are popular as houseplants due to their ability to thrive in indoor environments with proper care. They prefer bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
