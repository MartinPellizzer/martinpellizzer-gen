    "intro": "Cerastium arvense var. capitatum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, and it produces numerous small, elliptical seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields. This species is notable for its ability to spread rapidly through vegetative reproduction."
