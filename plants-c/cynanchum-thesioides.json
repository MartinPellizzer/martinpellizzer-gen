    "intro": "Cynanchum thesioides, commonly known as the Chinese milkweed or the spiny milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in summer. Its milky sap, which contains latex, is a distinguishing feature and can be toxic to some animals. Cynanchum thesioides is often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in full sun."
