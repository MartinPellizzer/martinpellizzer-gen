    "intro": "Centaurea pungens f. alobyphylla, commonly known as the pale-flowered bluemink, is a botanical variant of the common centaury. It is characterized by its reduced, pale blue to white flower heads, which contrast with the typical red or purple hues of the species. The plant is a herbaceous perennial with slender, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. This form is less showy than the typical variety but is valued for its unique coloration and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
