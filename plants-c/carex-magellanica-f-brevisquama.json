It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, often forming low mats or clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It prefers moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy or boggy habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for water gardens and wetland landscapes."
