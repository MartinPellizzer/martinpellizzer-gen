It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, yellowish-green leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces dense clusters of yellow flowers, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
