    "intro": "Ceanothus herbaceus var. pubescens, commonly known as the gray ceanothus, is a low-growing, deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental value contribute to its significance in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
