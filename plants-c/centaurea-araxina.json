    "intro": "Centaurea araxina, commonly known as the Armenian knapweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Turkey. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201380 cm, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its bright yellow flowers are surrounded by pale blue or white ray florets, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind.
