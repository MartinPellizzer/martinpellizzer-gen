It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves with a minty scent, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in shady, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to shaded garden landscapes."
