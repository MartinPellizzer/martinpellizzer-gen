    "intro": "Cinnamomum heterotepalum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cinnamon or Malayan cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and bark, which contain essential oils. The plant typically grows in tropical rainforests and has lance-shaped leaves with a fragrant, slightly citrusy scent. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces berries that are used in traditional medicine. The tree is valued for its timber and aromatic properties, though it is less commonly cultivated than other cinnamon species."
