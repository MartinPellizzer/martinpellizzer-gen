It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are usually narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water. The species is well-suited to harsh environments due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
