    "intro": "Corchorus patens, commonly known as the common velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Corchorus patens is also valued for its fibrous stems, which have been used in traditional textiles and papermaking."
