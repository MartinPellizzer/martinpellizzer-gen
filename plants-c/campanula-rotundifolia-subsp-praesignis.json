    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia subsp. praesignis, commonly known as the round-leaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its round, broad leaves and a more compact growth habit compared to other campanula species. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
