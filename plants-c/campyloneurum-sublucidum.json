It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a single layer, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature.
