    "intro": "Chorizema nanum, commonly known as dwarf chorizema, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is sometimes cultivated for decorative purposes in horticulture."
