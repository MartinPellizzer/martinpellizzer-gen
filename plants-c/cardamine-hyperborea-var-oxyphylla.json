It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, yellow flowers and palmate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are finely divided and have a distinctive, feathery appearance. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
