    "intro": "Cerastium illyricum subsp. brachiatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy stems and clustered, bell-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in its often arid or rocky habitats. It blooms in early summer, producing pink to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This subspecies is often found in limestone soils and is considered a valuable plant for rock gardens and ecological restoration projects."
