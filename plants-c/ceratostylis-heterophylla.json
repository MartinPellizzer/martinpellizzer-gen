    "intro": "Ceratostylis heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and swampy areas. The plant features a short, stocky rhizome with a single, fleshy, lance-shaped leaf. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in a spike, often with a distinctive helmet-shaped labellum. This species is notable for its morphological variability, which contributes to its common name."
