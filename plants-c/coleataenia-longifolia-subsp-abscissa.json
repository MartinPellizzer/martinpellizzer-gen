    "intro": "Coleataenia longifolia subsp. abscissa, commonly known as the slender-leaved coleataenia, is a member of the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated, lanceolate leaves that are often hairy along the veins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with white petals and yellow stamens, typical of the family. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats in tropical regions. Its subspecific distinction is based on differences in leaf morphology and habitat preferences compared to other subspecies of Coleataenia longifolia."
