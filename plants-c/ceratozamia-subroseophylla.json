    "intro": "Ceratozamia subroseophylla, commonly known as the rose-leaf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, subrose-colored leaves that are elongated and pinnately compound. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its slow growth rate and specific habitat requirements make it highly susceptible to environmental changes and habitat loss. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique botanical species from extinction."
