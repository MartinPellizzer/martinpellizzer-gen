    "intro": "Craspedophyllum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are often yellow or white, and its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets. Craspedophyllum species are adapted to harsh environments, possessing deep root systems and succulent leaves to store water. These plants are sometimes used in traditional medicine and are of interest in ecological studies due to their resilience in dry climates."
