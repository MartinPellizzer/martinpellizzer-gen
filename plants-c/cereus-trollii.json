    "intro": "Cereus trollii, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a flowering cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces spiny, ribbed stems that help it conserve water in its arid environment. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Cereus trollii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique blooming habit."
