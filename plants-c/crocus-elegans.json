    "intro": "Crocus elegans, commonly known as the elegant crocus, is a species of flowering plant in the Iridaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted for storage and dormancy, allowing it to survive harsh winters. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging after the flowers have faded."
