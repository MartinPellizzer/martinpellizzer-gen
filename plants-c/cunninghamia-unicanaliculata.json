    "intro": "Cunninghamia unicanaliculata, commonly known as the single-channeled cypress, is a rare and endangered conifer native to China. It is characterized by its slender, evergreen foliage and distinctive, narrow, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in mountainous regions with acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a conservation priority."
