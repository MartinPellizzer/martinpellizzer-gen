    "intro": "Cissus lanceolata, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically bright green with a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round berries that are yellow when ripe. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cissus lanceolata is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and ability to trail or climb."
