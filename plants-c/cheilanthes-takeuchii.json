    "intro": "Cheilanthes takeuchii, commonly known as the Takeuchii rockcap, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is a perennial plant that typically grows on rocky outcrops and in dry, shaded environments. The plant features a compact, cushion-like growth form with thick, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Cheilanthes takeuchii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, arid conditions."
