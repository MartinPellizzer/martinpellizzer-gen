    "intro": "Camissonia cardiophylla, commonly known as the heart-leaved camissonia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
