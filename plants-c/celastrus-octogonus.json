    "intro": "Celastrus octogonus, commonly known as the eight-angled staff-vine, is a woody vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its distinctive eight-angled stem, which gives it its scientific name. The plant has opposite, simple, and usually ovate or elliptic leaves, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. The plant is often found climbing on trees or shrubs in forested areas."
