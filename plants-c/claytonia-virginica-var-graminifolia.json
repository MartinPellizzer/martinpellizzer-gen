    "intro": "Claytonia virginica var. graminifolia, commonly known as the slender spring beauty, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, giving it a distinct appearance compared to other Claytonia species. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a dense inflorescence. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland habitats and has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in loose, organic soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
