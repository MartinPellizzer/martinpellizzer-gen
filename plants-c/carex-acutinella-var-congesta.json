    "intro": "Carex acutinella var. congesta, commonly known as the clustered spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly rough texture, while the inflorescence consists of multiple spikelets arranged in a compact cluster. This variety is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
