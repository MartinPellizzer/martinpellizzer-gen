    "intro": "Cytisus balansae var. galianoi, commonly known as the Galiano broom, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has compound leaves composed of several pairs of narrow, linear leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
