    "intro": "Carex littorea, commonly known as the northern marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as bogs, marshes, and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Carex littorea plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
