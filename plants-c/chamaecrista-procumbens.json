    "intro": "Chamaecrista procumbens, commonly known as yellow struthium, is a low-growing leguminous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. Chamaecrista procumbens is adapted to sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and fields."
