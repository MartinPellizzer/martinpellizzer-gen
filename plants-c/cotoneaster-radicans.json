    "intro": "Cotoneaster radicans, commonly known as creeping cotoneaster, is a low-growing shrub native to regions of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It features trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats or ground covers. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are attractive to birds. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly waxy texture and can vary in color from dark green to reddish in autumn. Cotoneaster radicans is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a decorative ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
