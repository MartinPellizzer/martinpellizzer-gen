    "intro": "Chromolepis heterophylla f. typica, commonly known as the typical form of the variable leaf chromolepis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. The plant features alternate, lanceolate leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. The species is noted for its variability in leaf shape and size, which contributes to its common name."
