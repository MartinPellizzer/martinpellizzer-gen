    "intro": "Cassia javanica subsp. pubiflora, commonly known as the hairy cassia, is a shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with long, hairy stipules, which give it its subspecies name. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical spikes, typical of the legume family. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in open woodlands and along roadsides."
