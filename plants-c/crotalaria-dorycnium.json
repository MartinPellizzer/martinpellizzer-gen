    "intro": "Crotalaria dorycnium, commonly known as the narrowleaf cowpea, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated, pod-like structures that split open when mature to release the seeds. Crotalaria dorycnium is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often grown as a forage crop or for ornamental purposes."
