    "intro": "Collomia, commonly known as the fairy bells, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. These plants are native to western North America, particularly found in mountainous regions of the United States and Canada. Collomia species are characterized by their bell-shaped flowers, which range in color from white to pink and violet. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and hairy, and the plants often grow in rocky or sandy soils. They are often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodlands, where they contribute to the floral diversity of their ecosystems."
