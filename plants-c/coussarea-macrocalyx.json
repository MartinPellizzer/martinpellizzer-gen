    "intro": "Coussarea macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered coussarea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy green foliage and striking, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, red or orange berries that are edible for some bird species but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it requires specific care to flourish."
