    "intro": "Cardamine fluminensis, commonly known as the Fluminense water crowfoot, is a delicate aquatic plant native to South America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant features small, floating leaves that are divided into fine, feathery segments, aiding in photosynthesis. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in a cluster at the base of the leaves. Cardamine fluminensis plays a role in supporting aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates."
