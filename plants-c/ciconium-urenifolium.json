    "intro": "Ciconium urenifolium, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in coastal areas. The plant has a deep root system that filters out salt from the water it absorbs. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in yellow or greenish hues. Ciconium urenifolium plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
