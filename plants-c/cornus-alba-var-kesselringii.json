It is characterized by its striking red or pink bracts that emerge in early spring, often mistaken for flowers. The plant has small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters before the bracts. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green hue. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden landscapes for its vibrant seasonal display."
