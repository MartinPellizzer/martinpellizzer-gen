    "intro": "Claoxylon velutinum, commonly known as the velvet tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that are velvety to the touch. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
