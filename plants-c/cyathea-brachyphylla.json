    "intro": "Cyathea brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. Its rhizome is robust, supporting the growth of the trunk and allowing the plant to thrive in nutrient-rich soils. Cyathea brachyphylla plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various forest organisms."
