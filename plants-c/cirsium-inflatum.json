    "intro": "Cirsium inflatum, commonly known as the inflated thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, showy purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single, terminal head, and the plant is known for its robust growth habit. Cirsium inflatum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun."
