    "intro": "Crataegus crocina, commonly known as the red thornapple, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus crocina typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and other disturbed soils, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
