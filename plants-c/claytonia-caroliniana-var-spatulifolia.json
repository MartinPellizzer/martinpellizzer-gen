    "intro": "Claytonia caroliniana var. spatulifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved spring beauty, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features rosettes of ovate, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers in early spring, which are often borne on short, hairy stalks. Its foliage is characterized by a waxy, blue-green appearance and a tendency to curl under the weight of the flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats."
