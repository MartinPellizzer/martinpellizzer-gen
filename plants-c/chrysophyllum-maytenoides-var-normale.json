It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by spherical, yellowish fruits with a sweet, juicy pulp. The fruit contains a single large seed enclosed in a hard, woody endocarp, which is a distinguishing botanical feature of the species. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit in its native habitat."
