    "intro": "Cyperus orthostachyus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense, compact cluster at the base. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems topped with a cluster of small, pale yellow flowers, giving it its common name. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Cyperus orthostachyus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats."
