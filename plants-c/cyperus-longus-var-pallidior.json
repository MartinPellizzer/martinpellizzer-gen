    "intro": "Cyperus longus var. pallidior, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in summer. The plant thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in suitable habitats. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
