    "intro": "Chorilepidella biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often emerging from the water surface on short stalks. Chorilepidella biflora plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web and maintaining water quality."
