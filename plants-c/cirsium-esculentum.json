    "intro": "Cirsium esculentum, commonly known as the edible thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaves. The plant features spiny, lobed leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. Its purple to pink flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. While the leaves are edible when cooked, the plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
