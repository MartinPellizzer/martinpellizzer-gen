    "intro": "Cruciata coronata subsp. taurica, commonly known as the Tauric cruciata, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the southern regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, mountainous environments of its native habitat. It has limited distribution and is considered endangered due to habitat destruction and overcollection. Botanically, it is notable for its unique floral structure and ecological significance in its native ecosystem."
