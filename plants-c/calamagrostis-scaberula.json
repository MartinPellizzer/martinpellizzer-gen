    "intro": "Calamagrostis scaberula, commonly known as the rough bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral display. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
