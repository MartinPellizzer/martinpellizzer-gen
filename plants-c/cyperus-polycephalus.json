    "intro": "Cyperus polycephalus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of dark green, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on slender, branching stems. Cyperus polycephalus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways. Its adaptability makes it a common ornamental and wetland plant in various landscapes."
