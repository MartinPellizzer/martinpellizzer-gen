    "intro": "Cypripedium lindenii, commonly known as the Lindenberg's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, slipper-shaped flower that is typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome and grows in shaded, moist forest understories. Its leaves are usually broad and leathery, adapted to the humid, cool climate of its habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
