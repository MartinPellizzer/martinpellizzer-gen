    "intro": "Colchicum autumnale var. album, commonly known as the meadow death-cap, is a striking perennial plant native to Europe. It features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has basal, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It produces a distinctive, bulb-like corm that stores nutrients for the next growing season. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a poisonous plant and should be handled with care."
