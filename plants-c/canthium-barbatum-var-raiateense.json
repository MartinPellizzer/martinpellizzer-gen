    "intro": "Canthium barbatum var. raiateense, commonly known as the Raiatea spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the genus Canthium. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
