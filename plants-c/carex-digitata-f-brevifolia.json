    "intro": "Carex digitata f. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved spike-rush, is a variant of the spike-rush genus Carex. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces cylindrical spikes of small, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Carex family. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its foliage is often shorter and more densely packed compared to the typical form of Carex digitata."
