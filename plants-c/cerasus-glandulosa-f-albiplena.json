    "intro": "Cerasus glandulosa f. albiplena, commonly known as the white-flowered cherry, is a botanical variant of the Prunus glandulosa species. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which contrast with its dark green, glossy leaves. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 3 to 6 meters. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge, adding ornamental value to gardens. The fruit, if produced, is small and typically not edible due to its bitter taste."
