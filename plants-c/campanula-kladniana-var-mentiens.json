    "intro": "Campanula kladniana var. mentiens, commonly known as the Kladnica bellflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the Czech Republic. It is characterized by its bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its stems are upright and hairy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
