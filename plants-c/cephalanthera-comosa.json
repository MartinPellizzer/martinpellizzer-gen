    "intro": "Cephalanthera comosa, commonly known as the woolly greenhood, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to southeastern Australia. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, tuberous rootstock and a single, leafless stem that bears a single, showy greenish-white flower. The plant's unique floral structure features a hood-like lip and is pollinated by specific insects, particularly thynnid wasps. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as rainforests and heathlands. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
