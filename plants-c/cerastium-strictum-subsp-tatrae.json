    "intro": "Cerastium strictum subsp. tatrae, commonly known as the Tatra mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a fine layer of silky hair, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and gravelly soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows and scree slopes."
