    "intro": "Casearia serrulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf casearia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often serrated leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
