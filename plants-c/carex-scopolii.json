    "intro": "Carex scopolii, commonly known as the scopolii sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common component of wetland vegetation."
