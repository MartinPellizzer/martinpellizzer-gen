It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and stems. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish or reddish in color. Chamaeraphis pauciseta plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is sometimes used in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate salts."
