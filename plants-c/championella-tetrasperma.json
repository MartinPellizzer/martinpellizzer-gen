    "intro": "Championella tetrasperma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has no leaves, relying instead on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are white or pale green, with a unique structure that resembles a ghostly face, hence its common name. It is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered an indicator species for healthy wetland ecosystems."
