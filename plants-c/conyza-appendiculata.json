    "intro": "Conyza appendiculata, commonly known as the common ragweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. The plant produces a large number of lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Conyza appendiculata is also known for its allergenic pollen, which can cause respiratory issues in sensitive individuals."
