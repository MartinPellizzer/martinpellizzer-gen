    "intro": "Chariomma flava, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are succulent and adapted to conserve water, making it well-suited for harsh, dry environments. Chariomma flava plays a role in stabilizing soil in sandy habitats and is often found in disturbed areas."
