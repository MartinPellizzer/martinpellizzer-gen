    "intro": "Caragana cinerea, commonly known as the silverleaf shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and parts of the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and small, compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. Caragana cinerea is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It has been used historically for erosion control and as a source of fuel and forage."
