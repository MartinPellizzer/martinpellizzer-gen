    "intro": "Cotoneaster glaucophyllus, commonly known as the silver-leaf cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes. Cotoneaster glaucophyllus is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils."
