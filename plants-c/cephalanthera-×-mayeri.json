    "intro": "Cephalanthera \u00d7 mayeri, commonly known as the hybrid green twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in shaded, moist woodland environments. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive hood-like structure. Its leaves are grass-like and arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. This hybrid species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in ecological systems as a nectar source for certain pollinators."
