It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water due to its arid habitat. This subspecies is noted for its slow growth and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
