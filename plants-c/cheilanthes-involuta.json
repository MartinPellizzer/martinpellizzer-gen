    "intro": "Cheilanthes involuta, commonly known as the curled rock fern, is a species of fern found in arid and rocky habitats. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds. The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome that helps it store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are typically curled or rolled, which reduces water loss and protects the plant from intense sunlight. Cheilanthes involuta is often found on exposed rock surfaces and is well adapted to drought-prone environments."
