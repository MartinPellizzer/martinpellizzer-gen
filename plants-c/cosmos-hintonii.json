    "intro": "Cosmos hintonii, commonly known as Hinton's cosmos, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, and it produces small, feathery seed heads that aid in wind pollination. Cosmos hintonii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in xeriscaped gardens."
