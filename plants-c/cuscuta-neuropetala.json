    "intro": "Cuscuta neuropetala, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition. It produces small, yellow flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts to extract water and nutrients. The plant is native to various regions in North America and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to spread to new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked."
