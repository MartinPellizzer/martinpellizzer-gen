    "intro": "Cyperus alatus subsp. ascolepidioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, and its rhizomes can spread to form dense colonies. This subspecies is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, grass-like foliage."
