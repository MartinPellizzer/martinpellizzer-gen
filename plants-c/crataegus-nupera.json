    "intro": "Crataegus nupera, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which are edible but often used in jams and wines. Crataegus nupera is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its cardiovascular benefits."
