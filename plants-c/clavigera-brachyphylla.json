    "intro": "Clavigera brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-leaved clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and scale-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like structures. The plant produces tiny, spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the plant. Native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions, it thrives in rocky or forested soils. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in challenging conditions."
