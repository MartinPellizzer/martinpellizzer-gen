    "intro": "Carex portae, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers. Native to regions of Europe and Asia, Carex portae typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled berries. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
