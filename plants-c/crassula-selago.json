    "intro": "Crassula selago, commonly known as the silver leaf crassula, is a small, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, triangular leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the warmer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil and bright, indirect light. Crassula selago is often used in rock gardens or as a potted plant due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements."
