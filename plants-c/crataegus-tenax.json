    "intro": "Crataegus tenax, commonly known as the American hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and showy white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Crataegus tenax is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks, thriving in a variety of soil types. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant ecosystems."
