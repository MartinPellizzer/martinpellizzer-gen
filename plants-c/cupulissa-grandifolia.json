    "intro": "Cupulissa grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered cupulissa, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late spring. Its fruit is a distinctive, cup-like structure that encloses the seeds, a feature that gives the genus its name. Cupulissa grandifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
