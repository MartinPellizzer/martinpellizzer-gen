    "intro": "Cytisus supinus var. biflorus, commonly known as the creeping yellow broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant touch to its foliage. The plant has slender, woody stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. This variety is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and Mediterranean regions."
