    "intro": "Cyclosorus subappendiculatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, clustered fronds that form a dense, carpet-like growth. The fronds are typically narrow and have a soft, velvety texture, with a distinct central vein. It is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands, where it contributes to aquatic biodiversity. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a valuable indicator species for healthy aquatic habitats."
