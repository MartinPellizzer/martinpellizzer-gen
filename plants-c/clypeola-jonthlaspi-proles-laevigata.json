    "intro": "Clypeola jonthlaspi proles laevigata, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed clypeola, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy surface. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
