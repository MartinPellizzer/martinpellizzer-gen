    "intro": "Capparis spinosa var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough caper, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces distinctive, round, green fruits that turn red when mature. Its leaves are thick, waxy, and often have a rough texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant is widely cultivated for its edible flower buds, which are used in culinary applications."
