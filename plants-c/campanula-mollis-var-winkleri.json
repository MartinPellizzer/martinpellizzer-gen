    "intro": "Campanula mollis var. winkleri, commonly known as the Winkler's bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, hairy stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are narrow and lanceolate, often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and adaptability to harsh environmental conditions."
