    "intro": "Catinga oblongifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments, making it a common understory species. Its fruit, which resembles a starfruit, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. However, it is not as widely cultivated as other starfruit varieties due to its specific habitat requirements."
