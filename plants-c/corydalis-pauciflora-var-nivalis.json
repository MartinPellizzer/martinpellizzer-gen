    "intro": "Corydalis pauciflora var. nivalis, commonly known as the alpine corydalis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high elevations. The plant features slender, hairy stems and small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. Corydalis pauciflora var. nivalis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
