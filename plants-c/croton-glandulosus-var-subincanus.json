    "intro": "Croton glandulosus var. subincanus, commonly known as the woolly croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a serrated margin. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils in full sun."
