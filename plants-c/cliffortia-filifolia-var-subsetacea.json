    "intro": "Cliffortia filifolia var. subsetacea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cliffortia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, thriving in full sun. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires well-drained conditions to prevent root rot."
