    "intro": "Cynometra koko, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local carpentry and furniture making. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
