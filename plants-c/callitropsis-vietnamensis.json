    "intro": "Callitropsis vietnamensis, commonly known as the Vietnamese cypress, is a rare evergreen conifer native to Vietnam. It belongs to the family Cupressaceae and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, scale-like foliage. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and cool, humid climates. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
