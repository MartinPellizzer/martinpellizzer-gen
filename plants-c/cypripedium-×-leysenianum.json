    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 leysenianum, commonly known as the Leysen's lady's tresses, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its long, spiraled inflorescence composed of numerous pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or wooded slopes. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces a single, erect flower spike with a distinctive, fragrant scent. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
