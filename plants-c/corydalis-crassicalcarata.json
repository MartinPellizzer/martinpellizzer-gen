It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant produces small, oval-shaped capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Corydalis crassicalcarata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland plantings."
