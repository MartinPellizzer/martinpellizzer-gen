    "intro": "Cerastium pumilum subsp. gussonei, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grassy slopes. Due to its compact size and hardy nature, it is well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
