    "intro": "Carex cuspidata, commonly known as the sharp-tipped sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and have a sharp, pointed tip. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers in the summer, which are followed by triangular, three-sided seed heads. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. Carex cuspidata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
