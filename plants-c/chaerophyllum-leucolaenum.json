    "intro": "Chaerophyllum leucolaenum, commonly known as white hogweed, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-shaped clusters of white flowers. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive, somewhat unpleasant odor. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a potential weed in some regions."
