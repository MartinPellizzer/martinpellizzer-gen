    "intro": "Caladenia speciosa, commonly known as the showy spider-orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, spider-like appearance. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive, elongated labellum that sets it apart from other orchid species. Caladenia speciosa is often found in grassy woodlands and is a popular subject for botanical study due to its unique morphology and ecological significance."
