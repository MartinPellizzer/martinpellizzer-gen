It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in the fall, typically from September to November. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulb-like structure called a corm. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Colchicum texedense is part of the Colchicaceae family and contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful if ingested."
