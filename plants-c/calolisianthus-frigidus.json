    "intro": "Calolisianthus frigidus, commonly known as the frostbloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking silver-blue petals and compact, bushy growth habit. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand low temperatures. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help insulate the plant from freezing conditions. Due to its unique appearance and limited habitat, Calolisianthus frigidus is considered a botanical curiosity and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
