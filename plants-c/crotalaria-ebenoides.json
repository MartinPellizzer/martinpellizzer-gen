    "intro": "Crotalaria ebenoides, commonly known as the African velvet bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features palmate leaves with three to five leaflets and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that attract pollinators. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny pod, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of protein-rich seed meal. However, it is also considered a potential weed in some agricultural settings."
