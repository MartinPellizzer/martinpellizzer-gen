    "intro": "Cirsium latinervium, commonly known as the narrow-veined thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. The plant features spiny, lobed leaves with a rough texture and a distinctive central stem that bears purple to pink flowers. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant is characterized by its robust root system and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
