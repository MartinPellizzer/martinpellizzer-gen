    "intro": "Centaurea pinnatifida subsp. pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrowleaf star-thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, branched stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. Due to its invasive tendencies in some areas, it is considered a weed in parts of North America."
