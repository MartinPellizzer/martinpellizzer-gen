    "intro": "Cestrum amictum var. longiflorum, commonly known as the long-flowered cestrum, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, simple, and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by nocturnal insects, particularly moths, due to their scent and color. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural spread in suitable habitats."
