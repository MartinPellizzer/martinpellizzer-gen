    "intro": "Ceropegia biddumana, commonly known as the Biddumana milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a succulent species characterized by its fleshy, tuberous stems and thick, waxy leaves that help it store water. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a unique, hooded structure. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is well adapted to periods of drought. Due to its ornamental appeal and unique morphology, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in xeriscapes."
