    "intro": "Carlina xeranthemoides, commonly known as the Mexican coneflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant features a sturdy, branching stem with narrow, gray-green leaves that have a fuzzy texture. Its showy, daisy-like flowers bloom in shades of yellow to orange, often with a central purple disk, and are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
