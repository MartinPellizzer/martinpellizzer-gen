    "intro": "Ceropegia guttata, commonly known as the \"string of pearls\" or \"heartleaf ceropegia,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features trailing stems with small, fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in tiny white spots. The plant produces delicate, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting specific pollinators like moths. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
