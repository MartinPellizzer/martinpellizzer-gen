It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a peppery aroma, reminiscent of watercress, and small white or pale purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in rocky stream banks or along woodland paths. Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional culinary practices. The species is also valued for its role in ecological systems, supporting pollinators and contributing to soil stability."
