    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris anglica, commonly known as common mouse-ear or velvetleaf, is an annual weed belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of four-petaled white flowers. The plant produces small, round, pod-like fruits that burst to disperse its seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a persistent weed in various ecosystems."
