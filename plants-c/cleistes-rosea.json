    "intro": "Cleistes rosea, commonly known as the rosepink orchid, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, pale pink to rose-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a unique, compact growth habit with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with three sepals and three petals, and are pollinated primarily by small flies. Cleistes rosea thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
