    "intro": "Cheilanthes lanuginosa, commonly known as the downy rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates and is adapted to low-nutrient soils. Its fronds are usually short and compact, with a distinctive silvery appearance due to the fine pubescence. This species is well-suited for xerophytic gardens and is often used in rockeries due to its drought tolerance."
