    "intro": "Coffea macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded coffee. It is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family, native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. The plant produces small, white flowers that give way to elongated, red berries containing the seeds used for coffee. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy texture. While it is less commonly cultivated for commercial coffee production compared to Coffea arabica or Coffea canephora, it holds significance in botanical studies and traditional use."
