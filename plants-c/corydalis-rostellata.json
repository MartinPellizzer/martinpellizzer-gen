    "intro": "Corydalis rostellata, commonly known as the narrowleaf larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often in alpine or subalpine regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Corydalis rostellata is also notable for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic alkaloids that require careful handling."
