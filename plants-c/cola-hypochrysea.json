    "intro": "Cola hypochrysea, commonly known as the white cola nut, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly the western part of the continent. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that develop into hard, woody pods. Each pod contains several seeds, which are the source of the stimulant caffeine. This species is valued not only for its botanical features but also for its cultural and economic significance in certain regions."
