    "intro": "Chlorophytum colubrinum var. colubrinum, commonly known as the snake plant, is a hardy, evergreen perennial native to South Africa. It features tall, upright leaves that are typically variegated with green and white or yellow markings. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires minimal water, making it an ideal houseplant. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water, which contributes to its resilience. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers on slender stalks, though it is more prized for its attractive foliage than its blooms."
