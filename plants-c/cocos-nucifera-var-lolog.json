    "intro": "Cocos nucifera var. lolog, commonly known as the dwarf coconut tree, is a variant of the coconut palm characterized by its shorter stature and compact growth habit. This variety typically reaches a height of around 5 to 8 meters, making it suitable for smaller spaces or ornamental purposes. Its leaves are broader and more rounded compared to the standard coconut palm, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The fruit produces smaller coconuts with a higher oil content, which can be beneficial for certain culinary or industrial applications. Despite its smaller size, it retains the same drought-resistant and salt-tolerant qualities as its larger relatives, making it adaptable to coastal and tropical environments."
