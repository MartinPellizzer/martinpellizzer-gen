    "intro": "Cyperus litoreus, commonly known as salt marsh flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often found in marshes and estuaries. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Cyperus litoreus plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
