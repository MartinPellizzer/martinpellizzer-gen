    "intro": "Cirsium vulgare subsp. crinitum, commonly known as the hairy thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, purple flowers and deeply lobed, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its longer, more pronounced hairs on the leaves and stems compared to other Cirsium species."
