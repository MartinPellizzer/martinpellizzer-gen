    "intro": "Corallorhiza arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona coralroot, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is a non-photosynthetic orchid. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients, making it a saprophytic plant. The plant produces small, reddish or yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in a dense spike. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its reliance on specific fungal associations, it is often found in association with pine and juniper woodlands."
