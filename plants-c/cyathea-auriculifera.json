    "intro": "Cyathea auriculifera, commonly known as the ear-shaped tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern, with the trunk forming a central axis and new fronds emerging from the base. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller, branching segments, giving the plant a lush, feathery appearance. Cyathea auriculifera is often found in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in the understory."
