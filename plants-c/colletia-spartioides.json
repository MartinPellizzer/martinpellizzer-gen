    "intro": "Colletia spartioides, commonly known as the desert candelabra cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America. It features a branching, cylindrical stem that often develops a tree-like structure with multiple stems rising from the base. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. Colletia spartioides is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and unique appearance."
