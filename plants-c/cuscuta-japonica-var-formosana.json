    "intro": "Cuscuta japonica var. formosana, commonly known as the Japanese dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. The plant has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants, forming a dense network. It is native to East Asia and is often found growing on crops like rice and soybeans. Its life cycle involves producing seeds that can remain viable in soil for many years."
