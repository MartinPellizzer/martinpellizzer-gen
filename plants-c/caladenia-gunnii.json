    "intro": "Caladenia gunnii, commonly known as the Gunns' spider-orchid, is an orchid species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and its striking, spider-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces a single, erect flower with a distinctive hooded labellum, which is a key feature in its identification. Caladenia gunnii is typically found in heathlands and open forests, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and threatened species."
