    "intro": "Calamus brevifrons, commonly known as the short-nosed calamus, is a member of the Aroid family (Araceae). It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the wetlands and marshy areas of countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant features a stout, creeping rhizome with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, typical of the Aroid family. Calamus brevifrons is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and ecological role in wetland habitats."
