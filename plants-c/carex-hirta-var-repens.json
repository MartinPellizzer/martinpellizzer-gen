It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed, with a soft, hairy texture on the lower surface. Its inflorescence consists of a cluster of small, spike-like structures bearing tiny brown flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of wetland habitats."
