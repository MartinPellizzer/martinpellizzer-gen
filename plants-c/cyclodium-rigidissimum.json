    "intro": "Cyclodium rigidissimum, commonly known as the rigid cyclodium, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Cyclodium rigidissimum has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with rigid, branched stems. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
