It is characterized by its woody shrub structure and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant features thorn-like structures on its stems, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
