    "intro": "Castilleja affinis var. affinis, commonly known as the narrowleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that resemble paintbrushes. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on host plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in its native range."
