    "intro": "Cyperus grossianus, commonly known as the swamp spikerush, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or reddish in color. Cyperus grossianus thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
