    "intro": "Claytonia occulta, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rosette of dark green, velvety leaves and produces small, white, star-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its scientific name reflects its elusive and ghostly appearance, which becomes more pronounced as it fades after blooming. Claytonia occulta is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
