    "intro": "Cactus recurvatus, commonly known as the zigzag cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, angular, and branching stems that form a zigzag pattern, which helps reduce water loss by minimizing surface area. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the warm season, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing transpiration. Cactus recurvatus is well adapted to harsh desert environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
