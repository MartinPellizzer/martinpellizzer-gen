    "intro": "Centranthus calcitrapae var. alpestris, commonly known as the Alpine centranthus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white down. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
