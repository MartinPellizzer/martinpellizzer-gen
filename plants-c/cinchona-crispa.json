    "intro": "Cinchona crispa, commonly known as the rough bark cinchona, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its rugged, fissured bark and compound leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. It produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries. Cinchona crispa is valued for its historical role in the production of quinine, although it is less commonly cultivated today compared to other cinchona species."
