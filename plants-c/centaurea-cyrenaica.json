    "intro": "Centaurea cyrenaica, commonly known as the Cyrenaica cornflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in coastal areas of North Africa and southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to coastal and arid environments. Centaurea cyrenaica is a perennial herb that can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters, with its compact growth habit allowing it to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
