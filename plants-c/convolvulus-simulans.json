    "intro": "Convolvulus simulans, commonly known as the common bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Bindweed family (Convolvulaceae). It is a herbaceous perennial that produces trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant has spirally arranged leaves and stems that twine around other plants or objects, a characteristic feature of the genus Convolvulus. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been naturalized in many regions around the world. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it both a popular garden plant and a weed in agricultural settings."
