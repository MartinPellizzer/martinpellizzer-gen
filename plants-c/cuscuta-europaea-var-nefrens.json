    "intro": "Cuscuta europaea var. nefrens, commonly known as European dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that\u7f20\u7ed5 around its hosts. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia and can be found growing on a variety of host species, including grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and natural vegetation."
