    "intro": "Capraea vulgaris, commonly known as the common sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, often blue or violet-colored flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a rosette of fleshy, spiny leaves that help it retain moisture in its salty, windy habitat. Capraea vulgaris thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a notable species in maritime botany."
