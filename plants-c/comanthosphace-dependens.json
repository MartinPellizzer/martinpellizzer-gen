    "intro": "Comanthosphace dependens, commonly known as the hanging bladderworts, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for trapping prey, which are typical of the carnivorous habits of many members of this family. The plant is typically found in freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its leaves are often slender and may appear in clusters, while the flowers are small and usually green or yellowish in color. Comanthosphace dependens plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
