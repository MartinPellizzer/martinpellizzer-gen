    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 lenis, commonly known as the hybrid rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is a cross between Cistus ladaniferus and Cistus monspinosus, resulting in a plant with distinctive features combining traits from both parents. The species is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for Mediterranean climates. The plant also produces resinous secretions, which have been historically used in perfumery and traditional medicine."
