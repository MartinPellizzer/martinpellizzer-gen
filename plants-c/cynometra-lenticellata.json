    "intro": "Cynometra lenticellata, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round, smooth-seeded fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a glossy appearance. The wood is valued for its fine texture and is used in furniture and carving, though the plant is also appreciated for its ornamental qualities."
