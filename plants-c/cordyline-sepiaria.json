    "intro": "Cordyline sepiaria, commonly known as the black-leafed cordyline, is a striking plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dark, almost black, foliage that contrasts beautifully with its lighter-colored stems. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Cordyline sepiaria is well-suited for tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
