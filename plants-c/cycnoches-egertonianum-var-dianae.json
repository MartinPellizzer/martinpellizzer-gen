    "intro": "Cycnoches egertonianum var. dianae, commonly known as the Dianae's cycnoches, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a combination of white, green, and purple hues. The plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
