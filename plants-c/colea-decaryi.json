    "intro": "Colea decaryi, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pendulous inflorescences bearing showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, where it thrives on the forest floor or as an epiphyte on trees. Its flowers exhibit a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple, and are often adorned with intricate patterns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Colea decaryi is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
