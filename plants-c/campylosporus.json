    "intro": "Campylosporus, commonly known as the common liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the order Marchantiales. It is characterized by its thalloid structure, which is a flat, leaf-like body that lacks true roots, stems, or leaves. Campylosporus typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky areas. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia. These plants play an important role in soil stabilization and as indicators of environmental health."
