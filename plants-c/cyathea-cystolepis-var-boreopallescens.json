    "intro": "Cyathea cystolepis var. boreopallescens, commonly known as the pale-leaf tree fern, is a variant of the tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique trait makes it a fascinating subject for both botanical study and ecological research."
