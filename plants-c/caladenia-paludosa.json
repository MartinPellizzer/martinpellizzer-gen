    "intro": "Caladenia paludosa, commonly known as the marsh spider-orchid, is an Australian native orchid species that thrives in wetland habitats. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, strikingly shaped flower that resembles a spider. The plant typically grows in swampy or seasonally flooded areas, adapting to waterlogged soils. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow with red or brown markings, and they bloom during the autumn season. Caladenia paludosa is a delicate plant that requires specific environmental conditions to flourish."
