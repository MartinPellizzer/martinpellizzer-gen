    "intro": "Croton chypreae, commonly known as the Cyprus croton, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Cyprus. It is characterized by its distinctive, often colorful leaves that range from green to red or purple. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some areas."
