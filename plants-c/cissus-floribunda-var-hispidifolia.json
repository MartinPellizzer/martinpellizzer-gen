    "intro": "Cissus floribunda var. hispidifolia, commonly known as the hairy cissus, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves covered in fine, short hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are borne in clusters, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for vertical gardening and indoor spaces."
