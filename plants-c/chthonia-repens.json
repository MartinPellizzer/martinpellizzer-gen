    "intro": "Chthonia repens, commonly known as the creeping chthonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or swampy areas. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread horizontally and colonize new areas. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, while its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences. Chthonia repens is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in maintaining soil stability in wetland ecosystems."
