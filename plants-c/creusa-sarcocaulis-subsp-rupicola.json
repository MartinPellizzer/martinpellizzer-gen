    "intro": "Creusa sarcocaulis subsp. rupicola, commonly known as the rock creusa, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and dryland landscapes."
