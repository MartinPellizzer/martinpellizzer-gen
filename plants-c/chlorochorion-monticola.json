    "intro": "Chlorochorion monticola, commonly known as the mountain chlorochorion, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant's most distinctive feature is its thick, waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its leaves are dark green and have a unique pattern of chloroplast distribution, contributing to its name. Due to its limited habitat and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
