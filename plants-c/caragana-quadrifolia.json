    "intro": "Caragana quadrifolia, commonly known as the creeping shrub or four-leaf caragana, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and small, compound leaves that are often four-leafed, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees. Its hardy nature allows it to thrive in poor soils and harsh climates, making it a common species in steppe and forest-steppe ecosystems. The seeds are encased in a hard shell and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
