    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 leeanum incurvum, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
