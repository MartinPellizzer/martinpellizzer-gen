    "intro": "Croton spinosus, commonly known as the spiny croton, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny leaves that are typically bright green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its thorny foliage, it is sometimes used as a natural barrier in landscaping."
