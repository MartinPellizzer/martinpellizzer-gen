    "intro": "Campanula erinus, commonly known as the candytuft, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces small, oval fruits called capsules, which contain numerous tiny seeds. Campanula erinus thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and ability to bloom throughout the summer months."
