    "intro": "Cheilanthes arborescens, commonly known as the tree fern or cliff brake, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its robust, tree-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant possesses a short, thick rhizome that serves as a storage organ and anchor for the plant. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a dark green, leathery texture and a distinctive, glossy appearance. This fern is adapted to grow in rocky or crevice habitats, often in arid or semi-arid regions."
