It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which are edible but often used in jams and wines. Crataegus felix is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional medicine for its cardiovascular benefits."
