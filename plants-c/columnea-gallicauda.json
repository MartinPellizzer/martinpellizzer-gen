    "intro": "Columnea gallicauda, commonly known as the French-tailed columnea, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that resemble small, fleshy bells, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface, adding to its ornamental value. Columnea gallicauda is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
