    "intro": "Capsicum eximium var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly pepper or tomentose chili, is a unique variety of chili pepper characterized by its dense, fuzzy white pubescence covering its surface. It originates from the Andes region of South America, where it thrives in cool, high-altitude climates. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with small, ovate leaves and produces small, elongated fruits that range in color from green to red when mature. Its botanical features include a hairy calyx and a thick, waxy cuticle, which help protect it from environmental stress. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and mild to moderate heat levels, making it popular among gardeners and culinary enthusiasts."
