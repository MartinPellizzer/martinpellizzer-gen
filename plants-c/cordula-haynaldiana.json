    "intro": "Cordula haynaldiana, commonly known as the Haynald's cordula, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer. Cordula haynaldiana is native to parts of Europe and is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
