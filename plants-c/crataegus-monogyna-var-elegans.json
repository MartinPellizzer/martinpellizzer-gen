It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval leaves, and clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red berries in the autumn, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soils but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun to partial shade. This variety is often used in hedgerows and gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
