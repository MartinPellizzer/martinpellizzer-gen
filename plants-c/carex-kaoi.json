    "intro": "Carex kaoi, commonly known as the Kao's sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to the Pacific Islands, particularly found in Hawaii, where it grows in wetland and marshy habitats. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and supports local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution, Carex kaoi is considered a vulnerable species."
