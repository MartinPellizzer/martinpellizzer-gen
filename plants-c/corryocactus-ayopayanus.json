    "intro": "Corryocactus ayopayanus, commonly known as the Ayopayan cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, woolly spines, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
