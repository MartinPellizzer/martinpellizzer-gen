    "intro": "Carionia triplinervia, commonly known as the three-veined fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into numerous small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense tropical forests. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help to retain moisture in its native habitat. Carionia triplinervia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
