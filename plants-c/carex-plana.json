    "intro": "Carex plana, commonly known as the broadleaf sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. Native to wetlands and moist soils in North America, it thrives in areas with consistent moisture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
