    "intro": "Caroxylon aegaeum, commonly known as the Cyprus cedar, is a rare and ancient conifer native to Cyprus. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The tree has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a symbol of longevity and resilience. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and aromatic qualities. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now critically endangered and protected in its native region."
