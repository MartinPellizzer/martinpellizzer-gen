    "intro": "Crassula aphylla, commonly known as the stone rose or fairy rose, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves that form a rosette. The leaves are typically green to bluish-green, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. This hardy plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
