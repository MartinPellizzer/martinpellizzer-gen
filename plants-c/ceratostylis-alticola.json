    "intro": "Ceratostylis alticola, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf and a spike of small, greenish-white flowers. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the poor soils of its habitat. The species is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found in montane cloud forests."
