    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 olenus, commonly known as the Olenus lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats, often near streams or in bogs. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
