    "intro": "Calamagrostis scaberrima, commonly known as rough bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that are rough to the touch. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are the reproductive structures of grasses. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Calamagrostis scaberrima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
