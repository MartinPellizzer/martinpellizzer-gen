It is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid environments. The plant typically grows as a low-growing shrub with compact, rounded foliage. Its flowers are often small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pink. Coldenia succulenta is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
