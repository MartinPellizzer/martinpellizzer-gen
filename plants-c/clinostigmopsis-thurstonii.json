It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, with a smooth texture and dark green color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
