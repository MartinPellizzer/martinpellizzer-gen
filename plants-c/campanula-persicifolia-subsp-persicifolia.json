It features upright stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive peach-like scent. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and attractive foliage."
