    "intro": "Cuscuta chinensis var. trigyna, commonly known as Chinese dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to East Asia and can be found growing on a variety of plants, including crops and ornamental species. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its widespread distribution. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
