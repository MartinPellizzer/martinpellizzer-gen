    "intro": "Campanula compacta, commonly known as the compact bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features low-growing, mat-forming stems that produce clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
