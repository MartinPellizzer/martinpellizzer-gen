    "intro": "Cornutia graveolens, commonly known as the stinking nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, foul-smelling flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a rough texture, and it produces small, green berries that turn red when ripe. Due to its strong odor and toxic properties, it is often avoided by both animals and humans."
