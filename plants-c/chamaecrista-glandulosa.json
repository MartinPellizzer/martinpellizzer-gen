    "intro": "Chamaecrista glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular crownflower, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, branching stems covered in small, glandular hairs, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by narrow, bean-like pods that contain seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological restoration."
