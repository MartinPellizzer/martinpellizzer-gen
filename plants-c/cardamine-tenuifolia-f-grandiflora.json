It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to moist, shaded environments, this plant thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland areas. The leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to other members of the cabbage family.
