    "intro": "Calamus disjunctus, commonly known as the disjointed sweetflag, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, slender stems and plicate leaves that are often ribbed and slightly curved. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typically found at the base of the leaves. Its rhizomes are aromatic and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties. Calamus disjunctus thrives in wet, swampy habitats and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
