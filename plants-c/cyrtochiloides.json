    "intro": "Cyrtochiloides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often appear in clusters, with petals that resemble translucent ghostly shapes. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Cyrtochiloides thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
