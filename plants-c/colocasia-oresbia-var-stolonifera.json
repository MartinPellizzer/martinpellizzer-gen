    "intro": "Colocasia oresbia var. stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous elephant ear, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces striking purple-tinted flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade. Its stolons, or runners, allow it to spread and form dense clumps, making it an effective ground cover in humid climates."
