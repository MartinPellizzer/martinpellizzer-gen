    "intro": "Cyclogramma squamaestipes, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Cyclogramma squamaestipes is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
