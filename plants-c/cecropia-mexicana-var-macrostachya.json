It is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and elongated, smooth trunks that can reach heights of up to 30 meters. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles. Its fruits are three-winged samaras that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats. This species plays an important role in tropical ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various animals."
