    "intro": "Cycnoches cooperi subsp. ayacuchoensis, commonly known as the Ayacucho cycnoches, is a rare orchid species native to the Andean region of Peru. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive yellow lip. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
