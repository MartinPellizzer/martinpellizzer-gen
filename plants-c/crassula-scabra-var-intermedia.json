    "intro": "Crassula scabra var. intermedia, commonly known as the Woolly Crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, woolly texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and unique appearance make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
