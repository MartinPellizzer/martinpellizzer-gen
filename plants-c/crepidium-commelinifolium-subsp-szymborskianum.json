    "intro": "Crepidium commelinifolium subsp. szymborskianum, commonly known as the Szymborskian pteridium, is a rare orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, pale green to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is known for its specialized mycorrhizal relationships with fungi. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many regions."
