    "intro": "Carya integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth walnut, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It belongs to the Juglandaceae family and is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves and distinctive, edible nuts. The tree produces large, clustered fruits that mature in the fall, with hard, woody shells enclosing the edible kernel. Its bark is thick and ridged, and it thrives in well-drained soils in temperate climates. The plant is valued for its timber and has been used by Indigenous peoples for food, medicine, and construction."
