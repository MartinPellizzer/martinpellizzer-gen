    "intro": "Carduus \u00d7 cyrneus, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Carduus and Cyneus. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is native to regions of Europe and Asia. The plant features spiny leaves and a tall, branched stem that bears purple to pink flower heads. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats."
