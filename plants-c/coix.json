It is characterized by its distinctive, hard, triangular seeds that are often used in traditional medicine and cuisine. The plant grows in wetlands and marshy areas, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its tall, slender stalks can reach heights of up to 2 meters, and it produces clusters of small, greenish flowers. The seeds are rich in nutrients and have been used for thousands of years in both food and herbal remedies."
