It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting specific pollinators like moths. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Ceropegia rufa is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
