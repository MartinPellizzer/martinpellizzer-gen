It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and dry habitats, showing adaptations to the unique environmental conditions of Hawaii. It plays a role in the local ecosystem, providing nectar for native pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
