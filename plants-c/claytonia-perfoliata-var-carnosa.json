It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, purple-tinged leaves that form a dense cluster near the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
