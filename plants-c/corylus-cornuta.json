    "intro": "Corylus cornuta, commonly known as the horned hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky husks that encase its edible nuts, which are typically harvested in the fall. The plant produces yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by female flowers that develop into the characteristic horn-shaped fruits. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the autumn. Corylus cornuta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
