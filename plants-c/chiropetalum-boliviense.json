    "intro": "Chiropetalum boliviense, commonly known as the Bolivian starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Bolivia. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its star-shaped, violet-blue petals that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its native habitat. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chiropetalum boliviense is considered a vulnerable species."
