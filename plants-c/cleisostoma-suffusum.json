    "intro": "Cleisostoma suffusum, commonly known as the golden lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green petals, which resemble the shape of a lip, giving it its common name. The plant produces fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cleisostoma suffusum is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
