It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink, often with a contrasting lip. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are broad and sword-shaped, arranged in a fan-like pattern. This orchid thrives in bright, indirect light and requires a humid, well-draining growing medium for optimal growth."
