    "intro": "Centrocarpha grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered centaury, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Centrocarpha grandiflora is often found in open meadows and along streambanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators."
