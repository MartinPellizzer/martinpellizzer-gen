    "intro": "Chiropetalum griseum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on the branches of trees, relying on epiphytic growth rather than soil for nutrients. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many areas."
