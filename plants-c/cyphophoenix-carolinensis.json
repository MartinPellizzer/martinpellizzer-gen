It is a member of the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its slender, single trunk and fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into red, fleshy fruits, which are edible for some bird species. Cyphophoenix carolinensis typically grows in wetlands and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its unique botanical features make it an important component of the wetland ecosystems in its native range."
