    "intro": "Coronilla orientalis f. hypopedunculata, commonly known as the Persian vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern regions. It features slender, erect stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are trifoliate with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in racemes. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in poor, dry soils. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental or for its nitrogen-fixing ability."
