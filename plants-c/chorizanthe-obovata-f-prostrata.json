    "intro": "Chorizanthe obovata f. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate choris, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its prostrate growth habit allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil in arid environments. This variety is a member of the Amaranthaceae family, characterized by its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions."
