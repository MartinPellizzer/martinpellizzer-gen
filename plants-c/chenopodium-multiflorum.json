    "intro": "Chenopodium multiflorum, commonly known as redroot pigweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its reddish stems and small, green to reddish leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish flowers that are followed by small, dry, three-angled fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Chenopodium multiflorum is considered a weed but also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
