    "intro": "Crepis porrifolia, commonly known as the turnip sedgegrass, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist, grassy habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, which are characteristic of the daisy family. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in fine hairs. Crepis porrifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
