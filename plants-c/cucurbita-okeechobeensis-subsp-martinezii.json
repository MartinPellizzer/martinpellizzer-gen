It is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, characterized by its trailing growth habit and lobed leaves. The plant produces large, orange-colored fruits that are typically harvested for their edible seeds and flesh. It thrives in wetland environments and is adapted to the humid, subtropical climate of its native region. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern and is often found in protected wetlands."
