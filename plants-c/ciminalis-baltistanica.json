    "intro": "Ciminalis baltistanica, commonly known as the Baltistan ciminalis, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Kashmir Himalayas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving at elevations between 3,000 and 5,000 meters. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a strong, spicy scent, while its flowers are white or pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region."
