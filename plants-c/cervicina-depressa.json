    "intro": "Cervicina depressa, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, and it is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cervicina depressa is considered a vulnerable species."
