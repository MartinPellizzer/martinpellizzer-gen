    "intro": "Cerasus vulgaris, commonly known as the sweet cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Asia. It produces small, oval leaves that are dark green and serrated along the edges. The plant blooms with white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by the development of sweet, red fruits. The fruits are typically harvested in late summer and are widely cultivated for their culinary and ornamental value. Cerasus vulgaris is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various climates."
