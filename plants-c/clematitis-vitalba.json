    "intro": "Clematitis vitalba, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically bright yellow to green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Clematitis vitalba is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
