    "intro": "Combretum erosum, commonly known as the roughleaf flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, whitish hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and parks."
