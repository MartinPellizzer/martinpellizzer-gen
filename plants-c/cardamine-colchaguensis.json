    "intro": "Cardamine colchaguensis, commonly known as the Chilean watercress, is a perennial herb native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to watercress, making it a potential candidate for culinary use. However, it is relatively rare and has limited commercial cultivation due to its specific habitat requirements."
