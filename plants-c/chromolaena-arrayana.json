    "intro": "Chromolaena arrayana, commonly known as Hawaiian fever vine, is a vigorous perennial shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and a distinctive yellowish-green underside. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its botanical characteristics make it both ecologically significant and challenging to manage in invaded habitats."
