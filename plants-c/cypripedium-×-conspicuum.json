    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 conspicuum, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy pouch-shaped lip that resembles a slipper, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments and has a long, fleshy rhizome that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Its flowers are usually pink to red in color, with a white or pale yellow throat, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Cypripedium \u00d7 conspicuum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
