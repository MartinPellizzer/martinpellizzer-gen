It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its distinctive, feather-like leaves. The fronds are typically dark green and have a rough, scaly texture on the underside."
