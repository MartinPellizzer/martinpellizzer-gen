    "intro": "Cardamine amara var. trisecta, commonly known as the three-lobed watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It features small, trifoliate leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in wet soils, often found along stream banks and in woodland areas. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to other watercress varieties."
