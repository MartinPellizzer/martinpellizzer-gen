The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or brown streaks. Calanthe sandsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a potted plant."
