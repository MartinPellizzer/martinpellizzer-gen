    "intro": "Calanthe alta, commonly known as the highland calanthe, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. Calanthe alta is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
