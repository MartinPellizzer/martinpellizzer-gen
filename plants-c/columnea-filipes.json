    "intro": "Columnea filipes, commonly known as the trailing columnea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, cascading stems that often root at the nodes, making it an excellent choice for hanging baskets or trained foliage. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract hummingbirds and other pollinators. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Columnea filipes thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture to maintain its vibrant appearance."
