    "intro": "Carex neopolycephala var. simplex, commonly known as the simple-headed marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
