    "intro": "Carex ustulata var. brevipedunculata, commonly known as the short-stalked sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. It thrives in wet to moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished by its shorter peduncles compared to other Carex species, making it a unique and identifiable member of the sedge family."
