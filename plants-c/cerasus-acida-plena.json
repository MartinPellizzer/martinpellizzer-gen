    "intro": "Cerasus acida plena, commonly known as the sour cherry tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern and central Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense foliage and clusters of small, white flowers in early spring. The plant produces small, tart red berries that are often used in jams, pies, and other culinary applications. Its botanical features include simple, alternate leaves and a woody stem with a smooth, grayish-brown bark. Cerasus acida plena is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in both horticulture and food production."
