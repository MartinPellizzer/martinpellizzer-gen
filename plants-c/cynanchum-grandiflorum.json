    "intro": "Cynanchum grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered milkweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes other milkweeds, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive corona, which attracts pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its milky sap contains latex, a common feature among milkweed species. Cynanchum grandiflorum is often found in dry, open habitats like prairies and woodland edges."
