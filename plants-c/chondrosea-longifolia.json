    "intro": "Chondrosea longifolia, commonly known as the long-stemmed sea lettuce, is a marine green alga found in coastal areas. It thrives in shallow, tide-pool environments and is characterized by its ribbon-like, flattened thallus. The plant has a simple structure with no true roots, stems, or leaves, but it possesses a central axis with branching filaments. It reproduces both sexually and asexually through spores and vegetative propagation. Chondrosea longifolia plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
