It features bright yellow, buttercup-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has heart-shaped, broad leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found near streams or in marshy areas. Caltha palustris is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in herbal medicine."
