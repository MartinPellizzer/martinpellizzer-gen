    "intro": "Calanthe beamanii, commonly known as the Beaman's calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and its clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on decaying organic matter. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies over time. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, Calanthe beamanii is considered threatened in many of its native ranges."
