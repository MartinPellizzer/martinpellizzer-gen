    "intro": "Cerastium illyricum, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Cerastium illyricum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in moist areas."
