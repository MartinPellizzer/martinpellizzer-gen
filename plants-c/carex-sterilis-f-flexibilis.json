    "intro": "Carex sterilis f. flexibilis, commonly known as the flexible sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. This plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The inflorescence consists of male and female flowers, with the female flowers typically located above the male ones, a feature common in many sedges."
