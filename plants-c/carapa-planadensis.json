    "intro": "Carapa planadensis, commonly known as the Brazilian copaiba tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and can grow up to 30 meters tall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its bark and latex have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. The species is also valued for its timber, which is lightweight and resistant to decay."
