    "intro": "Ctenitis comorensis, commonly known as the Comorian rock fern, is a member of the Davalliaceae family and is native to the Comoros archipelago. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth and compound fronds. The fronds are typically pinnately divided, with a distinctive, serrated appearance along the margins. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. The plant's unique morphology and restricted distribution make it an important species for botanical study in the region."
