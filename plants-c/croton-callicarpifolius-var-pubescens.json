    "intro": "Croton callicarpifolius var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy-leaf croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its medicinal properties, it has also been used in traditional herbal remedies."
