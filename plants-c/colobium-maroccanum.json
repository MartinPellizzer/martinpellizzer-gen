It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent-like leaves adapted to dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in drought-tolerant gardens."
