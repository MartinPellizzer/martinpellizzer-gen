    "intro": "Corytholoma sceptrum var. arenosum, commonly known as the sand dune lichen, is a specialized symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. It thrives in arid environments, particularly on sand dunes, where it forms a crust that stabilizes the substrate. The plant's structure is a complex lichen, not a true plant, with the fungal component providing protection and the algal or cyanobacterial partner carrying out photosynthesis. It is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low moisture conditions. This variation is notable for its ability to colonize harsh, unvegetated soils, making it an important pioneer species in desert ecosystems."
