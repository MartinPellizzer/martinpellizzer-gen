    "intro": "Capparis loddigesii, commonly known as the rock caper, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapted to dry and saline conditions. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
