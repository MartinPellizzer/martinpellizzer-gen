    "intro": "Carex orbicularis subsp. orbicularis, commonly known as the broadleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with oval, often reddish-brown leaves that are broader than they are long. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
