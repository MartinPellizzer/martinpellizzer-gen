    "intro": "Carex digitalis var. macropoda, commonly known as the broadleaf sedges, is a perennial sedge native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and have a slightly waxy texture. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, three-ranked flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is valued in wetland restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
