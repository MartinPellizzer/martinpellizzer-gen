    "intro": "Coussapoa villosa subsp. polycephala, commonly known as the hairy shield-leaf orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its velvety, hairy leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its growth habit is typically epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. This subspecies is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations in tropical rainforests."
