    "intro": "Cyathea urbani, commonly known as the Urban's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a mass of persistent, fibrous roots. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, giving it a distinctive and elegant appearance. Cyathea urbani thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its slow growth rate and unique morphology make it a valuable species for both horticultural and ecological studies."
