    "intro": "Catoblastus inconstans, commonly known as the variable catoblastus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to Central and South America, particularly found in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with woody stems and palmate leaves that have a distinct lobed structure. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a showy display of colors that attract pollinators. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in natural habitats."
