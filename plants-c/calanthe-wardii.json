    "intro": "Calanthe wardii, commonly known as the Ward's calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountain forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. Calanthe wardii thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth."
