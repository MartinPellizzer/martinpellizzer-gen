    "intro": "Cynodon pedicellatus, commonly known as the slender buffalo grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and coastal dunes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
