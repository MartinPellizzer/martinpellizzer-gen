    "intro": "Calamagrostis breviligulata subsp. champlainensis, commonly known as Champlain reedgrass, is a grass species native to North America, particularly found in wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This subspecies is distinguished by its slightly shorter ligules and narrower leaves compared to other members of the species."
