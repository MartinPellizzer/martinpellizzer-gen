    "intro": "Cremolobus humilis, commonly known as the dwarf lichen, is a small, crustose lichen that grows on rocks and soil in arid environments. It is characterized by its dense, leathery thallus and a pale to yellowish coloration. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its symbiotic relationship between algae and fungi for nutrition. It is typically found in dry, sunny habitats across parts of Australia and New Zealand. Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and air pollution."
