    "intro": "Carex disticha var. decipiens, commonly known as the False Spikerush, is a perennial sedge native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-brown flowers in early summer. It is often mistaken for other Carex species due to its similar appearance. The varietal form 'decipiens' is distinguished by its unique flowering structure and habitat preferences."
