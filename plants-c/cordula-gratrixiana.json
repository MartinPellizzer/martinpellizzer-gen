    "intro": "Cordula gratrixiana, commonly known as the coastal cordula, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Cordula gratrixiana plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
