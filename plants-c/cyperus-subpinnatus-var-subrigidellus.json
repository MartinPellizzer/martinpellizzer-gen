It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly twisted and have a fibrous texture. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical structure makes it adaptable to moist soils and suitable for wetland restoration projects."
