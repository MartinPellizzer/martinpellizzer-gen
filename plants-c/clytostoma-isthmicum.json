    "intro": "Clytostoma isthmicum, commonly known as the Isthmian star orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale purple. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in seasonal environments. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the base of the plant. Clytostoma isthmicum thrives in humid, shaded habitats and is often found growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices."
