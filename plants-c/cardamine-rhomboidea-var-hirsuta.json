    "intro": "Cardamine rhomboidea var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy watercress, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often submerged or floating in wet habitats. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically borne on slender stems. Its leaves and stems are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to other members of the mustard family. This variant is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other moist environments across temperate regions."
