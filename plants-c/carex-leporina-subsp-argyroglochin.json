    "intro": "Carex leporina subsp. argyroglochin, commonly known as silver-haired sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a silvery or grayish bloom, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike that bears small, three-lobed flowers. This subspecies is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
