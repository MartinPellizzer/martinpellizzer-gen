    "intro": "Cyrtandra nubincolens, commonly known as the cloud forest cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
