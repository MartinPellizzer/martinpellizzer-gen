    "intro": "Cadetia opacifolia, commonly known as the opacifoliate bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth, waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a border plant."
