    "intro": "Cinnagrostis polygama var. filifolia, commonly known as the silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silky texture and pale blue-green foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It produces small, pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it a suitable choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping."
