    "intro": "Cerastium glaucum var. octandrum, commonly known as the silverweed or white deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to its often damp habitat."
