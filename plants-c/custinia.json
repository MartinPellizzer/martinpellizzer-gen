    "intro": "Custinia, commonly known as the desert broom, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Namibia and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. Custinia species are often found growing on rocky soils and are adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. These plants play a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small desert animals."
