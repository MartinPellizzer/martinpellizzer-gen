    "intro": "Cyrtandra \u00d7 mapulehuensis, commonly known as the hybrid Cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to Hawaii. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats, such as rainforests, and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the Hawaiian Islands. Due to its restricted distribution and hybrid origin, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
