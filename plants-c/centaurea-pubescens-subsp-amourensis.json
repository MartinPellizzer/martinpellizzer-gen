    "intro": "Centaurea pubescens subsp. amourensis, commonly known as the Amourensis Blushflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy foliage and shorter, more compact growth habit compared to other Centaurea species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
