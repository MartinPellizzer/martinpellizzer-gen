It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in grassy habitats and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The subspecies is distinguished by its larger, more robust leaves compared to other forms of Crepis albida."
