    "intro": "Cyanastrum, commonly known as the blue star, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features basal leaves that are lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. Cyanastrum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
