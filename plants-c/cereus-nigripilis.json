    "intro": "Cereus nigripilis, commonly known as the black-haired candle cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its spines are short and dense, providing protection from herbivores. Cereus nigripilis is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
