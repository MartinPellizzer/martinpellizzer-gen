It features aromatic, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
