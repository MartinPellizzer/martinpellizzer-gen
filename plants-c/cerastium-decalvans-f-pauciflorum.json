    "intro": "Cerastium decalvans f. pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The flowers are typically white or pink, with five petals, and are borne in clusters at the leaf axils. This subspecies is notable for its reduced floral display compared to the typical form, with fewer flowers per inflorescence. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions, particularly in meadows and along pathways."
