    "intro": "Carex collifera, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats or clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Carex collifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
