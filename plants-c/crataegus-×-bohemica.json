    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 bohemica, commonly known as the Bohemian hawthorn, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Crataegus monogyna and Crataegus laevigata. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters. The plant features thorned branches, elliptical to ovate leaves with serrated edges, and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters. Its fruit is a red, juicy berry that ripens in the autumn, attracting various bird species. The Bohemian hawthorn is native to Central Europe and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges."
