It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Calanthe vestita thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories."
