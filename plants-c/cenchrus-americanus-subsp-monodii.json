    "intro": "Cenchrus americanus subsp. monodii, commonly known as sandbur, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is an annual grass that thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The plant produces distinctive burrs with hooked spines, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters. The species is adapted to arid environments and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
