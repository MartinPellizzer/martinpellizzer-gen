    "intro": "Convolvulus subvolubilis, commonly known as the lesser bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial vine that produces small, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves and twining stems that allow it to climb or trail along the ground. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it both a common weed and a sometimes cultivated ornamental plant."
