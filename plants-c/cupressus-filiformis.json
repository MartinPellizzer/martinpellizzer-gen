    "intro": "Cupressus filiformis, commonly known as the Mexican threadleaf cypress, is a small evergreen conifer native to Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in a narrow, columnar shape, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. It produces small, spherical cones and is often cultivated as an ornamental tree in gardens. Its slow growth rate and unique foliage make it a popular choice for landscape design."
