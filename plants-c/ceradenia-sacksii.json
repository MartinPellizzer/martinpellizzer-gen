    "intro": "Ceradenia sacksii, commonly known as the Sacks' ceradenia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
