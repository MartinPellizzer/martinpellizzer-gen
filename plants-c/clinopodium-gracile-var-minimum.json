    "intro": "Clinopodium gracile var. minimum, commonly known as dwarf creeping betony, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, shade-tolerant ground cover."
