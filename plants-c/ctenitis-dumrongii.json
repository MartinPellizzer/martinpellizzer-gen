It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, segmented appearance with a serrated margin. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on rocky substrates in tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
