    "intro": "Cyperus flavescens f. caucasicus, commonly known as the Caucasian flatsedge, is a variant of the flat sedge species native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as along riverbanks or in shallow water. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous root system and spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
