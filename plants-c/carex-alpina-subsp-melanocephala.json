    "intro": "Carex alpina subsp. melanocephala, commonly known as the black-headed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its dark, almost black, bracts at the base of the inflorescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and rocky slopes. This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
