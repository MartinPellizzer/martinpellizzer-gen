    "intro": "Cleistes carautae, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a unique floral structure that resembles a closed cup, giving it the common name \"cup orchid.\" The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Due to habitat loss, Cleistes carautae is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts to protect its dwindling populations."
