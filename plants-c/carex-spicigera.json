    "intro": "Carex spicigera, commonly known as the spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often have a distinct midrib, while the inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, three-ranked flowers. Carex spicigera plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
