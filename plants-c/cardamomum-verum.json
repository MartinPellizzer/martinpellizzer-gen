    "intro": "Cardamomum verum, commonly known as true cardamom, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, spindle-shaped seed pods. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that develop into the highly fragrant, reddish-brown pods containing the aromatic seeds. These seeds are widely used in both culinary and medicinal applications due to their strong, spicy flavor and essential oil content. Cardamomum verum thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil and requires a warm climate for optimal growth."
