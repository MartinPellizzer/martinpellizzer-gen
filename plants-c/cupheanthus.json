    "intro": "Cupheanthus, commonly known as the evergreen heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. The plants are characterized by their dense, compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Cupheanthus species typically thrive in well-drained, acidic soils and require a cool, moist climate. They are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
