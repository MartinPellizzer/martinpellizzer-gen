    "intro": "Cyperus squarrosus var. stenocarpus, commonly known as the narrow-carpel flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-ranked spikelets, which are often borne on short, erect branches. This variant is distinguished by its narrower carpels compared to the typical form of Cyperus squarrosus."
