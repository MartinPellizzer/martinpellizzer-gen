    "intro": "Coleosanthus megalodontus, commonly known as the giant sea hibiscus, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers and broad, waxy leaves that are adapted to saltwater environments. The plant thrives in sandy soils near the shoreline and is often found in intertidal zones. Its unique morphology allows it to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Despite its striking appearance, it is a relatively obscure species with limited documented ecological interactions."
