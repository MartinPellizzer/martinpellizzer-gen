    "intro": "Cordylanthus bemardinus, commonly known as the Bemardin's crowfoot, is a perennial herb native to California. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas and stream banks. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, legume-like pods that contain seeds. Cordylanthus bemardinus is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
