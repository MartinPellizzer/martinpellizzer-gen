    "intro": "Craniolaria, commonly known as the sea hares, is a genus of marine gastropod mollusks belonging to the family Aplysiidae. These animals are characterized by their soft, often brightly colored bodies and the presence of a distinctive, bilaterally symmetrical shape. They lack a shell and instead have a muscular, sac-like body that can change color for camouflage or communication. Craniolaria species are found in various marine environments, including coral reefs and rocky shores, where they feed on algae and other plant matter. Their botanical relevance lies in their role as herbivores in marine ecosystems, contributing to the regulation of algal growth."
