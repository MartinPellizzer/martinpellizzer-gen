It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are pinnate, with numerous small leaflets, and it produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The seeds are enclosed in elongated pods and are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties."
