    "intro": "Capparis calciphila, commonly known as the limestone caper, is a flowering plant native to rocky, calcareous soils in southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Capparaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in arid or semi-arid environments, often found on limestone outcrops and cliffs. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for insects and birds. Despite its hardy nature, it is relatively rare and requires specific conditions to thrive."
