    "intro": "Calandrinia hortiorum, commonly known as the Mexican ice plant, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Portulacaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that range from pink to red. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Calandrinia hortiorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid environments."
