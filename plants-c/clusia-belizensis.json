    "intro": "Clusia belizensis, commonly known as the Belize glorybower, is a shrub native to Central America, particularly Belize. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and showy blooms. Clusia belizensis is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
