    "intro": "Cousinia tenuiramula, commonly known as the slenderleaf globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a perennial herb characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and silvery-gray foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, rocky environments. Cousinia tenuiramula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
