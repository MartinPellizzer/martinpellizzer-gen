    "intro": "Cereus tenuissimus, commonly known as the slender candle cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a small, columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a tall, slender stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces white flowers that bloom at night, a characteristic common among many cacti in the Cactaceae family. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its unique shape and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts of succulents."
