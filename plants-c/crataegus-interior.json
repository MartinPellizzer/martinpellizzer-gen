    "intro": "Crataegus interior, commonly known as the interior hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate to elliptic leaves, and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red or orange berries that are edible for birds but generally considered toxic to humans. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness in various soil conditions."
