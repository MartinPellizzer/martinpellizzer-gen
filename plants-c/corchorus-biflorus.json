    "intro": "Corchorus biflorus, commonly known as the two-flowered knotweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. The seeds are encased in a fibrous capsule, which aids in their dispersal by wind or animals."
