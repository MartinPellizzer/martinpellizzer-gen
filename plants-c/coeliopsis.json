These plants are characterized by their showy, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in spring. They are native to regions in southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Coeliopsis species are often found in rocky or sandy soils and prefer full sun to partial shade. The flowers are usually white or pale blue, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
