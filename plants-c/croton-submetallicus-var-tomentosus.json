    "intro": "Croton submetallicus var. tomentosus, commonly known as the velvety croton, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, tomentose leaves that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Native to tropical regions, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its ornamental value is primarily due to its unique foliage rather than its flowers."
