    "intro": "Clidemia alata, commonly known as velvetleaf or false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom throughout the growing season. Clidemia alata is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and stream banks. It is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats, making it a common weed in some regions."
