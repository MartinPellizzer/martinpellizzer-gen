    "intro": "Convolvulus bussei, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trumpet-shaped, violet to purple flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Convolvulus bussei is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
