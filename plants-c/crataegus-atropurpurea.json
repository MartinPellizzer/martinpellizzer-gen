    "intro": "Crataegus atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple-flowered hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark purple to reddish stems, which become more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and they turn a striking red or orange in the autumn. Crataegus atropurpurea is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
