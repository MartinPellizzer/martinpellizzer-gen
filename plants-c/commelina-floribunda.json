    "intro": "Commelina floribunda, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in clusters, surrounded by white bracts, creating a mist-like appearance. The plant has heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Commelina floribunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
