    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis subsp. nuriae, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks, marshes, and wet meadows. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a peppery aroma, and small white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are often used in salads or as a garnish due to their sharp, spicy flavor. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves and slightly different floral structure compared to the typical form of Cardamine pratensis."
