    "intro": "Ceratosanthes palmata, commonly known as the palmate ceratosanthes, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It features a distinctive palmate leaf structure, with five to seven lobes radiating from a central point, giving it a fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Ceratosanthes palmata is often found in wetlands and along the edges of streams, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
