    "intro": "Calymmatium notorrhizum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking member of the Apocynaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and Angola. The plant is characterized by its vibrant purple or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is noted for its unique appearance and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking visual appeal."
