    "intro": "Condalia lineata var. melanocarpa, commonly known as the black-fruited condalia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, fruit that contrasts with its green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are often covered in a fine, hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. This species is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
