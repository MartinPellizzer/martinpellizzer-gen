    "intro": "Calamagrostis hackelii, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It produces fluffy, pale-green to brown seed heads in the fall, which contribute to its ornamental value. Calamagrostis hackelii is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
