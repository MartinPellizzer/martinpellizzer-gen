    "intro": "Corydalis anthriscifolia, commonly known as the parsleyleaf larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, branched stems that bear alternate, pinnately compound leaves resembling those of parsley. The plant produces clusters of delicate, spurred flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
