    "intro": "Crotalaria glabra, commonly known as yellow cowpea, is an annual herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with distinctive spurred petals, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in hard pods and are often used as a source of protein in some parts of the world. Crotalaria glabra is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable cover crop."
