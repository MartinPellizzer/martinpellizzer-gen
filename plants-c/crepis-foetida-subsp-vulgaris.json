It is characterized by its small, spiky, yellow flowers that appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy, grass-like leaves and produces achene fruits enclosed in a pappus. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its strong, unpleasant odor is a notable feature, especially when the plant is crushed."
