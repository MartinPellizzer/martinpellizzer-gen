    "intro": "Colchicum hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy autumn crocus, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant features showy, petal-like bracts that surround the true flowers, which are small and clustered at the base. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. The plant is part of the Colchicaceae family and is known for its medicinal properties, though its bulbs contain toxic alkaloids."
