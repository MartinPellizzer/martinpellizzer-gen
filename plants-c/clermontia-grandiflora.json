    "intro": "Clermontia grandiflora, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a rare and unique plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, succulent leaves. The plant produces a single, tall flower stalk that bears a cluster of yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in the high-altitude, volcanic soils of the Haleakal\u0101 crater, where it is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is listed as an endangered species."
