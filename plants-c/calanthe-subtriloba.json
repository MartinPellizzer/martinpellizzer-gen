    "intro": "Calanthe subtriloba, commonly known as the three-lobed calanthe, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces striking, showy flowers with three distinct lobes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it thrives in the undergrowth. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are often pink or white and attract various pollinators."
