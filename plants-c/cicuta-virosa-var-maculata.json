    "intro": "Cicuta virosa var. maculata, commonly known as the spotted water hemlock, is a highly toxic member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems that are often marked with purple or brown spots, and its small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters. The plant contains potent toxic compounds, primarily cicutoxin, which can cause severe poisoning in both humans and animals. It thrives in wet, disturbed soils along stream banks and in marshy areas. Due to its extreme toxicity, it is considered a noxious weed and requires careful handling."
