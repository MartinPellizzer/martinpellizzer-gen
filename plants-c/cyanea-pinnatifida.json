    "intro": "Cyanea pinnatifida, commonly known as the Hawaiian sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the plant is well adapted to the tropical climate of Hawaii. Cyanea pinnatifida plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for native pollinators."
