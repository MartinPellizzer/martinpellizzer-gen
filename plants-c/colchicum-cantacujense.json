    "intro": "Colchicum cantacujense, commonly known as the Cantacuj\u00e9n colchicum, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Colchicaceae and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its bulbs are toxic and contain colchicine, a compound used in medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
