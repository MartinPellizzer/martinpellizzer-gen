    "intro": "Ceratochloa maritima, commonly known as the sea barley, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is a perennial grass that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes through its extensive root system. Due to its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions, it is considered an important species for ecological restoration in maritime areas."
