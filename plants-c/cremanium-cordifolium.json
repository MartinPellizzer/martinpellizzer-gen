    "intro": "Cremanium cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-leaved cremanium, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking heart-shaped leaves, which are typically deep green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
