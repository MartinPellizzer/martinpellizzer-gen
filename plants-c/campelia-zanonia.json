    "intro": "Campelia zanonia, commonly known as the Zanzibar tree, is a tropical plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and showy, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Campelia zanonia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
