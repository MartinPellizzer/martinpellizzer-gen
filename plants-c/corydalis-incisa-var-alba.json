    "intro": "Corydalis incisa var. alba, commonly known as the white fringed lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded woodlands or rocky areas. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds. Corydalis incisa var. alba is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
