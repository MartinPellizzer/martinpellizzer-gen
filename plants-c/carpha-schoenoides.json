    "intro": "Carpha schoenoides, commonly known as flatleaf bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, forming dense clumps with slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats. Carpha schoenoides is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
