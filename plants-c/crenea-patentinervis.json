    "intro": "Crenea patentinervis, commonly known as the broad-veined water plant, is a species of aquatic plant characterized by its distinctive leaf structure. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves with prominent, parallel veins that give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are often floating or submerged, depending on the water conditions. Crenea patentinervis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
