It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its woody stem and opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels. The bark of Cinchona dichotoma contains quinine, a compound historically used in the treatment of malaria."
