    "intro": "Cypripedium amesianum, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the northeastern United States. It features a large, pinkish-white pouch-shaped lip that serves as a pollination trap, attracting insects like flies and bees. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has a single upright stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and overcollection. The botanical characteristics of Cypripedium amesianum make it a unique and valuable component of its native ecosystem."
