    "intro": "Crataegus sera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often thorned stems and clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Crataegus sera is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
