    "intro": "Cardamine multifida, commonly known as the forked watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often divided into three narrow, lance-shaped lobes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through moist soil, while its leaves are often used in traditional herbal remedies. Cardamine multifida is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
