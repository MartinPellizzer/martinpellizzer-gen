    "intro": "Cyclodon, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Cyclodon is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
