    "intro": "Candollea leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leafed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish spore clusters on the undersides of its leaves, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Candollea leptophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
