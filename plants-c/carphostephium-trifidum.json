    "intro": "Carphostephium trifidum, commonly known as the three-lobed dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it its common name. Its flowering stems rise from the center of the rosette, bearing yellow flowers that later develop into fluffy seed heads. Carphostephium trifidum is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions."
