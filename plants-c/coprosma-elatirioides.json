    "intro": "Coprosma elatirioides, commonly known as the silver coprosma, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red berries that are a food source for native birds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. Coprosma elatirioides is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to provide habitat for local wildlife."
