    "intro": "Clermontia montis-loa var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender-leafed clermonthe, is a rare endemic plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories or rocky areas. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family, which includes various flowering plants known for their bell-shaped blooms. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this variety is considered endangered and is of significant ecological and botanical interest."
