It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and feathery plumes that add ornamental value to gardens. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive silver or white stripe running along the leaf midrib. This variety is prized for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
