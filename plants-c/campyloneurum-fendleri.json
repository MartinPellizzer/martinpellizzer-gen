    "intro": "Campyloneurum fendleri, commonly known as the Mexican fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into numerous small, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. The botanical features of Campyloneurum fendleri make it a notable species in the study of fern morphology and ecology."
