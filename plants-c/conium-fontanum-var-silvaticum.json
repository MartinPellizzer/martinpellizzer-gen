    "intro": "Conium fontanum var. silvaticum, commonly known as the wild hemlock, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and umbrella-shaped inflorescences. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in compound umbels, a common feature among members of its family. Its stems are hollow and have a distinctive, aromatic scent, while its leaves are often covered in fine hairs. This species is known for its toxic properties, containing compounds similar to those found in poison hemlock, making it highly dangerous to both humans and animals."
