    "intro": "Cydonia communis var. maliformis, commonly known as the Persian apple or white damson, is a cultivar of the quince plant native to the Middle East and South Asia. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white, pear-shaped fruits that are typically harvested in late autumn. The plant has a dense, thorny bush with broad, ovate leaves and fragrant, white flowers that bloom in spring. The fruit is often used in jams, jellies, and as a culinary ingredient due to its unique flavor and high pectin content. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun for optimal growth and fruit production."
