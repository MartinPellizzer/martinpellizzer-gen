    "intro": "Conyza erosa, commonly known as common sandmat, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Americas. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and has a sprawling growth habit. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are usually hairy and lance-shaped. Conyza erosa is characterized by its ability to produce a large number of seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It is often considered a weed but has some traditional uses in herbal medicine."
