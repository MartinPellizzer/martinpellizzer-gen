It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and a distinctive, buttressed trunk. The plant is a member of the Malvaceae family and is often found in disturbed habitats such as forest edges and clearings. It produces showy, yellowish-white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. This species plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
