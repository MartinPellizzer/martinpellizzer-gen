    "intro": "Calanthe bicolor, commonly known as the pink orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bi-colored flowers that typically feature a white or pale pink base with a vivid pink or red lip. The plant has broad, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Calanthe bicolor is a terrestrial orchid that prefers well-drained, acidic soil and is often found in forest understories. Its unique floral structure and coloration make it a popular choice for both horticultural and botanical study."
