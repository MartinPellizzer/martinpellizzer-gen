    "intro": "Coleus calycinus, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking silver-white variegated leaves, which contrast beautifully with its deep green veins. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens with suitable climate conditions."
