    "intro": "Calonemorchis crebra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous habitats such as wet meadows and marshes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it survive in wet conditions. Calonemorchis crebra is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora."
