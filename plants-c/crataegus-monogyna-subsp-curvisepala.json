    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna subsp. curvisepala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves and small, white to pinkish flowers that appear in early spring. The fruit is a red, fleshy pome that ripens in late summer, attracting various birds and small mammals. This subspecies is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable plant in both horticulture and natural habitats."
