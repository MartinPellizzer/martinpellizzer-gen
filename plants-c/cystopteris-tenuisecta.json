    "intro": "Cystopteris tenuisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the structure of true ferns, though it belongs to the order Polypodiales. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams, where it often forms dense colonies. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Cystopteris tenuisecta plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
