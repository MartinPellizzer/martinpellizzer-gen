    "intro": "Cenchrus mezianus, commonly known as the coastal grass or Mesian grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are adapted to thrive in saline and sandy soils. It is highly drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes. Its ecological importance lies in its ability to prevent soil erosion and provide habitat for various coastal organisms."
