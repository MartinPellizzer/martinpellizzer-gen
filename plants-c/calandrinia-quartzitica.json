    "intro": "Calandrinia quartzitica, commonly known as the quartzite portulaca, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, pink, and yellow. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in drought conditions. Calandrinia quartzitica is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
