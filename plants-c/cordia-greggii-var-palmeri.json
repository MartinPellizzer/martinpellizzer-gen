    "intro": "Cordia greggii var. palmeri, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds."
