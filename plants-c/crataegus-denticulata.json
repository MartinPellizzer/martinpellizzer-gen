    "intro": "Crataegus denticulata, commonly known as the toothed hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to elliptic leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white or pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red to orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Crataegus denticulata is often found in moist woodlands, stream banks, and thickets, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
