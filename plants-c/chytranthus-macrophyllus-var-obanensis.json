    "intro": "Chytranthus macrophyllus var. obanensis, commonly known as the Oban stonecrop, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to the Scottish Highlands. It features fleshy, basal leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
