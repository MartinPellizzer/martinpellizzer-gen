    "intro": "Calathea macrostachya, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that change color throughout the day, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty. The leaves typically display shades of green, silver, and pink, with intricate patterns that make it highly ornamental. It thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This plant is popular among indoor gardeners due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
