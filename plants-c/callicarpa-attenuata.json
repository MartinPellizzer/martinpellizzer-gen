    "intro": "Callicarpa attenuata, commonly known as the red honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that transition into vibrant red berries, which are a key feature of its botanical profile. These berries are edible and often used in traditional Chinese medicine. Callicarpa attenuata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
