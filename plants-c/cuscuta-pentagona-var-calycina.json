    "intro": "Cuscuta pentagona var. calycina, commonly known as the calycine dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed dispersal and host attachment. The plant is characterized by its thread-like stems that coil around host plants, often causing damage to agricultural crops. It is native to North America and is commonly found in fields and along roadsides. Its botanical significance lies in its unique parasitic adaptations and role in ecological interactions."
