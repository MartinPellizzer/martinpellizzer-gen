    "intro": "Crossopetalum gonocladum, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are opposite and linear, often with a slightly hairy surface, and the flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Crossopetalum gonocladum is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
