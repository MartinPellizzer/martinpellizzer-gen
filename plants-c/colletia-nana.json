    "intro": "Colletia nana, commonly known as the dwarf colletia, is a small, evergreen shrub native to South America. It features succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a white, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Colletia nana is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
