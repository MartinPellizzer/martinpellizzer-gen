    "intro": "Carex triangula, commonly known as the triangular sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant has triangular stems and produces small, three-ranked spikelets that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Carex triangula is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
