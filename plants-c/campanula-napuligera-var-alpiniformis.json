    "intro": "Campanula napuligera var. alpiniformis, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery down. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine environment."
