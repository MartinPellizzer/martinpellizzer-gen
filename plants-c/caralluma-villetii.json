It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a bitter taste. Caralluma villetii is adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient and unique species in its ecosystem."
