    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta var. maxima, commonly known as the hairy water-crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in a single umbel at the top of the stem. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in stream banks, wet meadows, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its delicate appearance and preference for wet environments, it is an important component of riparian ecosystems."
