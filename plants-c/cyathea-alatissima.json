    "intro": "Cyathea alatissima, commonly known as the broad-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizomes form a network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil. Cyathea alatissima is often found in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appearance."
