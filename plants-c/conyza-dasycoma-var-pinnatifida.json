    "intro": "Conyza dasycoma var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cudweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous annual with hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves. Its flowers are yellow, with ray florets that are often reduced or absent, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is adapted to survive in dry environments, with a deep root system and small, waxy leaves to reduce water loss."
