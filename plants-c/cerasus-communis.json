    "intro": "Cerasus communis, commonly known as the common cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is native to Asia and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in spring, which are typically white or pink, followed by small, drupaceous fruits. The fruit, known as a cherry, contains a single seed enclosed in a hard pit. Cerasus communis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also cultivated for its edible fruits."
