    "intro": "Chilocarpus cuneifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chilocarpus, is a member of the Proteaceae family and is native to South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which are followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as scrublands and rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
