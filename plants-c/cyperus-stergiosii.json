    "intro": "Cyperus stergiosii, commonly known as the Stergiosii flatsedge, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges. It is a perennial herb characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along water bodies. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically arranged in spikelets, a common feature among sedges. Cyperus stergiosii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
