    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia subsp. polymorpha, commonly known as the round-leaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of rounded, hairy leaves and produces bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in moist, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like environments. It has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in high-altitude habitats."
