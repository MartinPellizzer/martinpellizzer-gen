    "intro": "Chiliadenus rupestris, commonly known as the rock chile plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
