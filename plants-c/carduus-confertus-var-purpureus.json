    "intro": "Carduus confertus var. purpureus, commonly known as the purple thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and large, purple-tinged leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, purple to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value and ecological benefits make it a notable species in botanical gardens and natural habitats."
