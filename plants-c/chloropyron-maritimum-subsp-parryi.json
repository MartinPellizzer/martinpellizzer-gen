    "intro": "Chloropyron maritimum subsp. parryi, commonly known as Parry's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States. It typically features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale blue flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to survive in harsh, semi-arid conditions."
