    "intro": "Cremastus pulchra, commonly known as the purple tailed jewelweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has hairy, reddish stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its seeds are dispersed by the explosive release of its capsule fruits, a mechanism typical of the genus. Cremastus pulchra thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
