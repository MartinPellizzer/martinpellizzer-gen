    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia f. laevis, commonly known as the smooth bellflower, is a flowering plant native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rounded, often hairy leaves and bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or rocky habitats. It is a perennial species that forms low, spreading mats with numerous stems. The smooth, glabrous leaves of the f. laevis form are a distinguishing feature from other forms of Campanula rotundifolia."
