    "intro": "Chrysopogon aciculatus, commonly known as the slender grass or narrowleaf stipa, is a perennial grass species native to various parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, shrublands, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its botanical features make it an important component of arid and semi-arid ecosystems."
