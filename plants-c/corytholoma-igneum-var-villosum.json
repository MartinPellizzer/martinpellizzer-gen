    "intro": "Corytholoma igneum var. villosum, commonly known as the flame-colored lichen, is a unique foliose lichen that exhibits a striking red-orange hue. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on decaying wood in temperate forests. The plant's thallus is covered with fine, woolly hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. It plays an important role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for various microorganisms. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is often used as an indicator species for forest health."
