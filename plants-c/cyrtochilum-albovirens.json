    "intro": "Cyrtochilum albovirens, commonly known as the white-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking white to pale green flowers with prominent yellow veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Cyrtochilum albovirens is a popular choice for collectors due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
