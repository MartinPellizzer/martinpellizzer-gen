    "intro": "Cinnamomum zeylanicum var. ovatum, commonly known as cinnamon tree or sweet cinnamon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces reddish-brown berries containing winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark and leaves are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to cinnamon. The variety ovatum is distinguished by its smaller leaves and compact growth habit compared to the typical cinnamon tree."
