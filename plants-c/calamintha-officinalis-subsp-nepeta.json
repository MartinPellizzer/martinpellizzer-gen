    "intro": "Calamintha officinalis subsp. nepeta, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, often emitting a strong mint-like aroma when crushed. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, arranged in whorled clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and herbal cultivation. Its essential oils, rich in nepetalactone, are responsible for its characteristic effects on both humans and animals."
