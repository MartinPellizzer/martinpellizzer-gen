    "intro": "Coursetia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered coursetia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often used in landscaping in desert regions."
