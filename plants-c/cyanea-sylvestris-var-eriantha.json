    "intro": "Cyanea sylvestris var. eriantha, commonly known as the Hawaiian tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Its reproductive structures include both spores and, in some cases, small, inconspicuous flowers. This variant is distinguished by its hairy young leaves, which give it its specific epithet \"eriantha,\" meaning \"with hairy leaves.\""
