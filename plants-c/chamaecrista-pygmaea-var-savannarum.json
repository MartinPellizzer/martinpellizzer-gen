    "intro": "Chamaecrista pygmaea var. savannarum, commonly known as the dwarf crownflower, is a low-growing annual herb native to the southeastern United States. It features small, delicate yellow flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy, and its stem is slender with a pubescent surface. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a characteristic species of dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many areas."
