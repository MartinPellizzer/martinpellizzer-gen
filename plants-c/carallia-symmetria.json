    "intro": "Carallia symmetria, commonly known as the symmetrical beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often tinged with red on the underside, adding visual interest. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue berries that are edible for wildlife but toxic to humans. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and unique fruit display."
