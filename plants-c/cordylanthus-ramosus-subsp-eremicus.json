    "intro": "Cordylanthus ramosus subsp. eremicus, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. This subspecies is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
