    "intro": "Cardamine uliginosa f. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved water crowfoot, is a variant of the water crowfoot genus Cardamine. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are smaller than the typical species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wet meadows, stream banks, and marshy areas. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in a head, often appearing in early spring. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it thrive in nutrient-rich, waterlogged soils."
