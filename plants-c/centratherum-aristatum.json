    "intro": "Centratherum aristatum, commonly known as the tall goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stem and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, and the flowers are arranged in a loose cluster at the top of the stem. Centratherum aristatum is often used in native plant gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
