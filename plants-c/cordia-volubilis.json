    "intro": "[WRONG START] Codia volubilis, commonly known as the climbing cordia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a vigorous vine that can grow up to 10 meters in length, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by orange to red berries containing several seeds. Its fibrous roots and flexible stems make it suitable for use in living fences or as a cover plant in humid environments. Cordia volubilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some regions."
