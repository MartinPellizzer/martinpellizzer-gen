    "intro": "Cambessedesia rugosa, commonly known as the roughleaf camphor tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by oval, woody fruits. Its leaves and bark contain essential oils, which have been used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic and analgesic properties. Cambessedesia rugosa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid environments."
