    "intro": "Cestrum buxifolium, commonly known as the waxleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often mistaken for those of boxwood, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a small, red, berry-like structure that matures in late summer. Cestrum buxifolium is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and nocturnal floral display."
