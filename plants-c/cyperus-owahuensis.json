    "intro": "Cyperus owahuensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of freshwater habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
