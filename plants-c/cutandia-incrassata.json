    "intro": "Cutandia incrassata, commonly known as the African thornapple, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its dense, thorny branches. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a rough, hairy texture, while the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Cutandia incrassata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
