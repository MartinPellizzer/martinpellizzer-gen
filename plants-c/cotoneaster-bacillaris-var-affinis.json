    "intro": "Cotoneaster bacillaris var. affinis, commonly known as the dwarf cotoneaster, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically reaches heights of less than 30 centimeters and features dense, compact growth with small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a ground cover or ornamental plant."
