It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and savannas. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
