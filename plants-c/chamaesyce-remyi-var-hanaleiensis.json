    "intro": "Chamaesyce remyi var. hanaleiensis, commonly known as the Hanalei weed, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its small, clustered flowers and milky sap. The plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, often in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It has a prostrate growth habit with slender stems and small, alternate leaves. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in parts of its range."
