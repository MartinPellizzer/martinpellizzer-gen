    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis subsp. kansuana, commonly known as the Kansu brittle fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. This subspecies is notable for its fragile, easily broken fronds, which give it its common name."
