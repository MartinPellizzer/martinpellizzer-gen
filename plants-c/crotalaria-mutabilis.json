    "intro": "Crotalaria mutabilis, commonly known as the variable cowpea, is a flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that are often clustered in groups of three, and its pods contain small, kidney-shaped seeds. Crotalaria mutabilis is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it both a useful forage crop and a potential weed. It also has a unique ability to change its flower color as it matures, which contributes to its common name."
