    "intro": "[WRONG START] Calamagrostis inexpensa var. cuprea, commonly known as copper reed, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking coppery-red foliage, which turns bronze in the fall, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant produces fluffy, silver-gray seed heads that add visual interest throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist to wet soils and partial to full sun, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its dense growth habit makes it effective for erosion control and habitat creation for wildlife."
