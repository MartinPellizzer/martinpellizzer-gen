    "intro": "Carex hudsonii f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth Hudson sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its smooth, hairless leaves distinguish it from other Carex species, and it often forms dense colonies in its native environment. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
