    "intro": "Caladenia testacea var. hildae, commonly known as the Hildae Spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid endemic to Western Australia. It features a slender, leafless stem that bears a single, strikingly colored orchid flower with a distinctive spider-like appearance. The flower has a pale yellow to cream-colored labellum with a contrasting dark red or purple midrib. It thrives in sandy soils and is typically found in open habitats such as heathlands and grassy areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
