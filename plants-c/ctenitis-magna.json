It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a thick, fibrous trunk that supports its expansive canopy. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing cones, are located at the base of the fronds. Ctenitis magna plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
