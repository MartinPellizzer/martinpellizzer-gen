    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe xiphizusa, commonly known as the dragon's blood fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish spore clusters on the underside of its leaves, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Native to tropical regions of Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique appearance and historical use in traditional medicine contribute to its botanical significance."
