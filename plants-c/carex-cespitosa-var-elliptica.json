    "intro": "Carex cespitosa var. elliptica, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, strap-shaped leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
