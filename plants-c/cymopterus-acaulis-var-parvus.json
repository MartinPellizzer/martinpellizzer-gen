    "intro": "Cymopterus acaulis var. parvus, commonly known as the dwarf evening-primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. This variety is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
