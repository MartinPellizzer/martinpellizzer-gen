    "intro": "Cylindrolobus kalabakanensis, commonly known as the Kalabakan cylinder-lobed plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Indonesia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, cylindrical-shaped leaves with lobed margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
