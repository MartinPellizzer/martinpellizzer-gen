    "intro": "Cynanchum tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a dry capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cynanchum tomentosum is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
