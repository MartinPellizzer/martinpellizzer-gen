    "intro": "Chenopodium scabricaule f. pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf goosefoot, is a low-growing, annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, ovate leaves with a rough, sandpaper-like texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers arranged in compact clusters, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. Its short stature and succulent-like leaves make it well-adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor soils. This variety is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, where it thrives in full sun."
