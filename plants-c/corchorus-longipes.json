    "intro": "Corchorus longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with milky sap and distinctive floral structures. The plant is characterized by its erect, branching stems and palmate leaves that are often hairy and lobed. Its small, clustered flowers are typically greenish-yellow and lack showy petals, relying instead on wind pollination. Corchorus longipes is also known for its fibrous roots, which have been used in traditional medicine and textile production."
