    "intro": "Campanula panjutinii, commonly known as the Panjutin's bellflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Campanula panjutinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized gardens due to its unique appearance and limited distribution."
