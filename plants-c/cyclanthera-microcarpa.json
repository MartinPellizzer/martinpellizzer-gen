    "intro": "Cyclanthera microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited bitter apple, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers, pumpkins, and gourds. The plant produces small, yellow, cucurbit-like fruits that are typically spiky and covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while the stems are hairy and tend to climb using tendrils. The plant is known for its bitter taste, which is due to the presence of certain alkaloids and other secondary compounds."
