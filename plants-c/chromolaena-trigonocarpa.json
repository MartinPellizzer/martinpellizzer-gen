    "intro": "Chromolaena trigonocarpa, commonly known as the roughleaf croton, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
