    "intro": "Centella rupestris, commonly known as the rock centella, is a succulent plant native to rocky and arid regions. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers. The plant typically grows on limestone or rocky substrates, thriving in well-drained soils. Its compact growth habit and ability to store water make it well adapted to harsh environments. Centella rupestris is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance."
