    "intro": "Calea morii, commonly known as the \"Mexican nightshade,\" is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are erect and branching. Calea morii is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its traditional uses in folk medicine."
