    "intro": "Canephora capitata, commonly known as the wild coffee plant, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces red, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed, which is the source of its caffeine content. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to its genetic similarity to cultivated coffee species, it is of interest in botanical and agricultural research."
