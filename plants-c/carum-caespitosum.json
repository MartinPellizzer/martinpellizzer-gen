    "intro": "Carum caespitosum, commonly known as wild cumin or thimbleweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often grow in clusters, giving it its scientific name \"caespitosum,\" meaning \"tufted.\" The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family (Apiaceae). Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, with a mild, spicy scent reminiscent of cumin. Carum caespitosum is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks."
