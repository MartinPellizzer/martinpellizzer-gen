    "intro": "Carex duriusculiformis, commonly known as the hard-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. Its leaves are typically rigid and have a distinctive, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Carex duriusculiformis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wet or semi-aquatic conditions."
