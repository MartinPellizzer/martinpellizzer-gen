    "intro": "Capparis fascicularis var. scheffleri, commonly known as the desert caper, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure with thorned stems and small, pale green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or yellowish flowers, which are followed by edible, spherical fruits. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in harsh, dry environments. The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the edible capers derived from its flower buds."
