    "intro": "Cadetia citrina, commonly known as yellow whitlow grass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, bright yellow flowers clustered in loose inflorescences. The leaves are linear and grass-like, typically arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in coastal areas or along the edges of wetlands. The plant is notable for its ability to tolerate salt spray, making it a common sight in maritime environments."
