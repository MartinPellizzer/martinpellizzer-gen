    "intro": "Centradenia inaequilateralis, commonly known as the unequal-sided centradenia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often unequal in size, giving it its specific epithet. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
