    "intro": "Cynometra hankei, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that are edible. Its wood is highly valued for its fine grain and durability, making it useful in furniture-making. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native range."
