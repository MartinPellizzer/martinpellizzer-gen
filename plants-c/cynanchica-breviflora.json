    "intro": "Cynanchica breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruit is a cylindrical, ribbed follicle that splits open to release seeds. Cynanchica breviflora is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers."
