    "intro": "Crataegus brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stalked hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 8 meters and features thorny branches, which are a characteristic feature of the genus Crataegus. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins, and they turn yellow in autumn. Crataegus brachypoda is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
