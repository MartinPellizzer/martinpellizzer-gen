    "intro": "Cheilophyllum, commonly known as the \"lady's shoe\" or \"white lady,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that often appear in umbels. They are typically found in moist, temperate regions and are often associated with wetlands or stream banks. Cheilophyllum species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their delicate appearance and ability to thrive in shady conditions. However, they are relatively rare and require specific environmental conditions to flourish."
