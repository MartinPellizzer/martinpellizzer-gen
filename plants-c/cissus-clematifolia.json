    "intro": "Cissus clematifolia, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a trailing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It features heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round berries that are typically yellow or red when ripe. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil and partial to full sunlight. Cissus clematifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to climb or trail along surfaces."
