    "intro": "Cardamine macrophylla var. exaltata, commonly known as the tall water shield, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its botanical features make it an important species for aquatic ecosystems and a subject of study in botany."
