    "intro": "Cryosophila bifurcata, commonly known as the polar lily, is a rare flowering plant adapted to extreme cold environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in freezing conditions. It is typically found in Arctic tundra and alpine regions where the climate is harsh and short-lived. Due to its specialized adaptations, it plays a unique role in polar ecosystems."
