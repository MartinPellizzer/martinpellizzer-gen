    "intro": "Cheilanthes tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows on rock surfaces or in crevices, showcasing adaptations to harsh, dry environments. The plant has slender, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green coloration. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Cheilanthes tenuis is often found in regions with low rainfall and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
