    "intro": "Cyperus rotundus subsp. retzii, commonly known as purple flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that often bear purple or brown bracts. The plant typically grows in wet or disturbed soils, such as marshes, fields, and along waterways. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it a common weed in agricultural and natural areas. It is also known for its ability to thrive in a wide range of environmental conditions."
