It is characterized by its striking, papery bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are often red or orange in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
