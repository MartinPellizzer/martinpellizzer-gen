    "intro": "Centrosema salzmannii, commonly known as Salzmann's centrosema, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in humid, lowland areas. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects. Centrosema salzmannii is also utilized in agroforestry systems for its forage value and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
