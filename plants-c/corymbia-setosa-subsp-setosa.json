    "intro": "Corymbia setosa subsp. setosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironbark, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that is typically dark grey to black in color. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that appear in clusters, followed by woody, spherical fruits. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in dry sclerophyll forests. The subspecies is known for its hard, durable wood, which has been used traditionally by Indigenous Australians."
