    "intro": "Caperonia buettneriacea, commonly known as the whitecap orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling small caps, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, adapted to capture light in the dense canopy of its forest environment. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Caperonia buettneriacea is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
