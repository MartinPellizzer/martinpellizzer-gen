It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, diamond-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, citrus-like berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture. Its unique leaf morphology and climbing habit make it a popular choice for vertical gardening and indoor spaces."
