    "intro": "Coleus cyanophyllus, commonly known as blue-leaf coleus, is a herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue-green foliage, which is due to the presence of high concentrations of anthocyanin pigments. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture. It produces small, tubular flowers in shades of purple or pink, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Coleus cyanophyllus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant leaf color and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil and partial shade."
