    "intro": "Cynomorium coccineum subsp. songaricum, commonly known as the Chinese cistanche, is a parasitic plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various shrubs and trees. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a fleshy, reddish stem that is often used in traditional medicine. Its unique adaptations to harsh environments make it a subject of interest in botanical research. The subspecies is distinguished by its morphological and ecological characteristics compared to other members of the Cynomorium genus."
