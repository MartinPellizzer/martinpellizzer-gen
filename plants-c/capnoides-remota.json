    "intro": "Capnoides remota, commonly known as the remote capnoid, is a rare and unusual plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae, characterized by its unique floral structure and specialized adaptations to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with distinctive, hairy bracts that aid in water retention. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, reflecting its ability to survive in arid and cold conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Capnoides remota is considered a botanically significant but poorly understood species."
