    "intro": "Cryptantha nana var. ovina, commonly known as the dwarf cryptantha, is a low-growing annual plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of blue or purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its short stature and compact growth form make it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
