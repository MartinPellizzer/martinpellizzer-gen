    "intro": "Carya \u00d7 nussbaumeri, commonly known as the Nussbaumer hickory, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the black hickory (Carya cordiformis) and the shellbark hickory (Carya laciniosa). It is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The tree produces oval, spiny nuts enclosed in a thick, woody husk, which are typically harvested in the fall. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
