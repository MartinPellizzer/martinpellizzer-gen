    "intro": "Clusia grandiflora, commonly known as the waxleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year, giving it a lush appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by yellow-orange berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments. Clusia grandiflora is also valued for its air-purifying properties and resilience to urban conditions."
