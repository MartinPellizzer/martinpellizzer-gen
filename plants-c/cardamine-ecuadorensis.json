    "intro": "Cardamine ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuador buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. It has a short flowering period, usually in the spring, and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
