    "intro": "Canthium sordidum, commonly known as the stinking senna, is a tropical shrub native to Africa and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its rough, often hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by capsules containing numerous small, hard seeds. It is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is particularly noticeable when the plant is in bloom. Canthium sordidum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including forests and grasslands."
