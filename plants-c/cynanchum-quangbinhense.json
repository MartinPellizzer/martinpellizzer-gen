    "intro": "Cynanchum quangbinhense, commonly known as the Quang Binh milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to Vietnam. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is known for its milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found in mountainous regions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
