    "intro": "Cyperus squarrosus, commonly known as the woolly flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that often have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically found in clusters at the base of the plant. Cyperus squarrosus thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. It is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged soil and its unique foliage structure."
