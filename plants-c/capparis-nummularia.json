    "intro": "Capparis nummularia, commonly known as the shieldflower or dwarf caper, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing, evergreen shrub with small, waxy leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray in color. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is often used in rock gardens due to its compact size and ornamental value. Capparis nummularia is adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
