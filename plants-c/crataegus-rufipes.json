    "intro": "Crataegus rufipes, commonly known as the red-haired hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn vibrant shades of red in the fall. Crataegus rufipes is often found in woodland edges, open woods, and along streambanks."
