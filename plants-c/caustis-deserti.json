    "intro": "Caustis deserti, commonly known as the desert cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the rainy season, typically in summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its stem for survival in harsh environments. Caustis deserti is well adapted to desert conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species."
