    "intro": "Callitriche capillaris, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, often in muddy or sandy substrates. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with tiny, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape. Its flowers are small, white or greenish, and are usually borne on short stalks near the water's surface. Callitriche capillaris plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling."
