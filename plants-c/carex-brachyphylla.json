    "intro": "Carex brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils in wetlands, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a dense, low-growing mat. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are usually borne on slender, leafless stalks. Carex brachyphylla plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
