    "intro": "Cerasus adenophylla, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or Prunus serrulata, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark red, edible fruits. Cerasus adenophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly for its showy blossoms. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
