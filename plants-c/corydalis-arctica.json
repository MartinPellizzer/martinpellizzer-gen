    "intro": "Corydalis arctica, commonly known as the Arctic Corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters. The plant produces delicate, spurred flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Corydalis arctica is often found in tundra and alpine environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
