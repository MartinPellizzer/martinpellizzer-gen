    "intro": "Carex alpina, commonly known as alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce wind-pollinated flowers, and it often thrives in cold, temperate climates. Carex alpina plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
