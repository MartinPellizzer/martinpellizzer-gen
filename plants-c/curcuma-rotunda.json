    "intro": "Curcuma rotunda, commonly known as the globe turmeric, is a rhizomatous herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its swollen, knob-like rhizomes that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its rhizomes contain compounds such as curcumin, which contribute to its medicinal properties. Curcuma rotunda thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for both ornamental and therapeutic purposes."
