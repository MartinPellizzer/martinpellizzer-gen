    "intro": "Chenopodium maritimum, commonly known as sea goosegrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, greenish flowers that bloom in clusters. This plant thrives in saline environments, such as salt marshes and tidal flats, due to its ability to tolerate high salinity. Its root system helps stabilize coastal soils, preventing erosion. The plant is also known for its edible leaves, which have been used in traditional cuisines."
