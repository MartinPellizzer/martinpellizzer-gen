    "intro": "Cyperus durus, commonly known as the rigid flatsedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its grass-like leaves are narrow and linear, with small, clustered flowers that bloom in summer. Cyperus durus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
