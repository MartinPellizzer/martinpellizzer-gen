    "intro": "Centaurium gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum centaury, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing herb with slender stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils, particularly those rich in calcium carbonate, such as gypsum soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Centaurium gypsicola is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
