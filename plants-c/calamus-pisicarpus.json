    "intro": "Calamus pisicarpus, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a member of the Aroid family (Araceae). It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, slender stems and broad, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are typically enclosed in a spadix, a feature common in many aroid species. Calamus pisicarpus is native to wetlands and marshy areas in Asia, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent in certain cuisines."
