    "intro": "Cyrtacanthus corymbosus, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a member of the Campanulaceae family. It is a perennial shrub native to the Canary Islands, characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. Cyrtacanthus corymbosus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
