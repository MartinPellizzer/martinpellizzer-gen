    "intro": "Crataegus laevigata var. mathei, commonly known as the Mathe's hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible but typically consumed by birds rather than humans. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodlands and hedgerows. The leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall."
