    "intro": "Calycogonium rhamnoideum, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with opposite, ovate leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky appendages, aiding in wind dispersal. The plant is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
