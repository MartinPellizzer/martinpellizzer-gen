    "intro": "Colleteria exserta, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features slender, branching stems and produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Colleteria exserta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging landscapes."
