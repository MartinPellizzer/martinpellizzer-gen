    "intro": "Cirsium acantholepis var. heterolepis, commonly known as the rough thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in arid conditions. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
