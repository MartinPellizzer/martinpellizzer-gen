    "intro": "Cyperus salzmannii, commonly known as the Zebra rush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive striped, grass-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshy areas and along waterways. Cyperus salzmannii produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
