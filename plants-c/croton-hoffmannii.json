    "intro": "Croton hoffmannii, commonly known as Hoffmann's croton, is a species of flowering plant in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to red and yellow. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its foliage. Croton hoffmannii is also known for its potential medicinal uses in traditional African medicine."
