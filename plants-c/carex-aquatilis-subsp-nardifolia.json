    "intro": "Carex aquatilis subsp. nardifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are narrow and dark green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
