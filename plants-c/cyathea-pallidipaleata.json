It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for many decades, making it a long-lived species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to their aesthetic appeal and potential medicinal properties."
