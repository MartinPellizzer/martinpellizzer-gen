It is an annual herb with slender, branched stems and small, pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces fine, hairy leaves that are often mistaken for pine needles, giving it its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Conyza pinifolia is adapted to arid environments and is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
