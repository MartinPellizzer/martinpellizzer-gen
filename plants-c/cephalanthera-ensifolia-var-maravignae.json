    "intro": "Cephalanthera ensifolia var. maravignae, commonly known as the Maravigna's sword orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Madagascar. It is characterized by its elegant, sword-shaped leaves and striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, contributing to its ecological uniqueness. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some areas."
