    "intro": "Caladenia helvina, commonly known as the golden spider orchid, is an endemic species found in the south-western region of Western Australia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, hairy stem and a single, strikingly colored flower that resembles a spider. The plant produces a single, erect, yellowish-green flower with a distinctive, elongated labellum. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
