    "intro": "Cussonia umbellifera, commonly known as the African bracken or umbrella-leaved arrowroot, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and southern Africa. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces an inflorescence of small, white flowers arranged in an umbel, which is a key feature in its common name. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a starch source. Cussonia umbellifera thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
