    "intro": "Carex aztecica, commonly known as the Aztec sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowering spikes produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity. Carex aztecica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native habitats."
