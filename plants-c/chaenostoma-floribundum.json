It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded or partially shaded areas. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in naturalized settings."
