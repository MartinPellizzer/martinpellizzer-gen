    "intro": "Cissus obtusata, commonly known as the African stone plant, is a member of the family Vitaceae. It is a climbing or trailing plant characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically covered with a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals. Cissus obtusata is native to southern Africa and is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
