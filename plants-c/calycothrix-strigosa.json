    "intro": "Calycothrix strigosa, commonly known as the rough-stemmed broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its reliance on root connections to host species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing on the roots of grasses and shrubs. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants."
