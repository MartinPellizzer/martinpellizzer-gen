    "intro": "Cereus serpens, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking, large white flowers that open at night and emit a strong fragrance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. Cereus serpens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and nocturnal blooms."
