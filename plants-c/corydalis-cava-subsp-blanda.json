    "intro": "Corydalis cava subsp. blanda, commonly known as the slender corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters, featuring delicate, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop, and are characterized by their spurred petals. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for gardeners in cooler climates."
