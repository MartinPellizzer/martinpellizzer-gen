    "intro": "Convolvulus lanuginosus var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy bindweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a perennial vine characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in cultivated fields. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in many areas."
