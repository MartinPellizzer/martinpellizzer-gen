    "intro": "Cyclosorus \u00d7 jerdonii, commonly known as the Jerdon's water fern, is a hybrid species within the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into numerous small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures include sori, which are clusters of spore-producing organs located on the underside of the fronds. Cyclosorus \u00d7 jerdonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic or bog gardens."
