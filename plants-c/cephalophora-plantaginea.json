    "intro": "Cephalophora plantaginea, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Cephalophora plantaginea is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries."
