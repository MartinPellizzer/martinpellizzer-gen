    "intro": "Cerastium axillare, commonly known as the creeping snowberry, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its frost-resistant nature. Cerastium axillare thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
