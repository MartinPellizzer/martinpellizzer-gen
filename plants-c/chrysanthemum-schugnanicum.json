    "intro": "Chrysanthemum schugnanicum, commonly known as the Schugnan chrysanthemum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained conditions. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, and it produces small, oblong fruits called cypselae. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
