    "intro": "Corunastylis oligantha, commonly known as the slender-stalked corunastylis, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Commelinaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and relatively understudied species."
