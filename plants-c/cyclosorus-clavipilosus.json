    "intro": "Cyclosorus clavipilosus, commonly known as the hairy clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the moist, shaded environments of eastern North America. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and its distinctive, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically found at the base of the plant. Cyclosorus clavipilosus thrives in rich, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
