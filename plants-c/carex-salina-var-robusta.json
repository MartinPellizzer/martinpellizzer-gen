    "intro": "Carex salina var. robusta, commonly known as salt meadow sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal wetlands. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is adapted to saline and brackish environments. The plant typically grows in marshes, salt marshes, and estuaries where it tolerates high levels of salt in the soil. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous root system that helps stabilize the soil. It plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing shorelines."
