    "intro": "Calopogonium pedunculatum, commonly known as the hairy beggar's ticks, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and slender, hairy stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
