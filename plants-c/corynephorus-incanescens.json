    "intro": "Corynephorus incanescens, commonly known as the silver grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale green spikelets that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Corynephorus incanescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and erosion control."
