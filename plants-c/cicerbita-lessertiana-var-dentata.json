    "intro": "Cicerbita lessertiana var. dentata, commonly known as the serrated cicerbita, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries."
