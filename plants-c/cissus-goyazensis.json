    "intro": "Cissus goyazensis, commonly known as the Goyazensis devil's ivy, is a climbing plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that can store water, making it somewhat drought-tolerant. The plant produces small, pale greenish-white flowers that are typically followed by elliptical, waxy berries. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Cissus goyazensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor environments."
