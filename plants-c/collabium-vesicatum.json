    "intro": "Collabium vesicatum, commonly known as the blister cup, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers and inflated, bladder-like fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or prairies. Its leaves are alternate and have a slightly succulent texture, while its flowers bloom in early summer. The species is known for its unique seed dispersal mechanism, where the inflated fruits burst open to release seeds."
