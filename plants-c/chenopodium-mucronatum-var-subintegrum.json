    "intro": "Chenopodium mucronatum var. subintegrum, commonly known as the desert spinach or Navajo spinach, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. The leaves are edible and have been traditionally used by indigenous peoples for their nutritional value."
