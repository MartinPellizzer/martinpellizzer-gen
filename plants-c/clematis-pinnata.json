    "intro": "Clematis pinnata, commonly known as the lacecap clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with elongated, narrow leaflets that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, with white petals surrounding a central cluster of smaller, darker flowers. It thrives in partial to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Clematis pinnata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
