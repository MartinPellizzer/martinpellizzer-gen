It is characterized by its aromatic evergreen leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust flowering compared to other Cistus species."
