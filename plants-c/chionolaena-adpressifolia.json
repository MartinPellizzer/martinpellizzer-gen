    "intro": "Chionolaena adpressifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silverleaf groundcover, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for ornamental use in gardens. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for ground cover in warm climates."
