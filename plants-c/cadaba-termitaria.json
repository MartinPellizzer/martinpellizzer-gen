    "intro": "Cadaba termitaria, commonly known as the termite bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers, which bloom during the rainy season. It is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in harsh, semi-arid environments. Cadaba termitaria is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of browse for livestock."
