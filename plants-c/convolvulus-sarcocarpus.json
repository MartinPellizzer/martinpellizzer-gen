    "intro": "Convolvulus sarcocarpus, commonly known as the rock convolvulus, is a flowering plant belonging to the bindweed family, Convolvulaceae. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, inflated, bladder-like fruits known as sarcocarps. It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, and thrives in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
