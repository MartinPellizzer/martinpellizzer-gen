    "intro": "Caenopteris achilleifolia, commonly known as the Achilles' heel fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, hairy underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique, linear pattern along the margins of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
