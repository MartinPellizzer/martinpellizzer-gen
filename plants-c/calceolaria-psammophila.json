    "intro": "Calceolaria psammophila, commonly known as the sand calceolaria, is a species of flowering plant native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, hood-like flowers that resemble small cups, which are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Calceolaria psammophila is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
