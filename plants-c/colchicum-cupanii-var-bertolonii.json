    "intro": "Colchicum cupanii var. bertolonii, commonly known as the Bertoloni's autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It produces striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive crown-like structure, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous corm, which stores nutrients for the flowering cycle. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and prefers partial shade to full sun. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
