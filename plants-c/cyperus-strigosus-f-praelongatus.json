    "intro": "Cyperus strigosus f. praelongatus, commonly known as the long-stemmed flatsedge, is a variant of the flatsedge genus characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and dense, grass-like foliage. It is a perennial herb native to wetland and marshy environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows from rhizomes and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a robust, creeping stem structure. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
