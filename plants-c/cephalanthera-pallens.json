    "intro": "Cephalanthera pallens, commonly known as the pale lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, pale green stems and its dense, dark green, hairy leaves. The plant produces a tall, slender flowering stem that bears a loose raceme of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Cephalanthera pallens is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, typical of many orchid species."
