    "intro": "Capparis pyrifolia, commonly known as the firethorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. Its leaves are ovate and have a slightly serrated edge, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to the rocky, well-drained soils of its native habitat. Capparis pyrifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
