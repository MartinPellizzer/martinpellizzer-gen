    "intro": "Cactus bulbispinus, commonly known as the white-tipped cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate contrast to its rugged appearance. Its root system is shallow and widespread, allowing it to absorb moisture from light rains. The cactus is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and dry scrublands."
