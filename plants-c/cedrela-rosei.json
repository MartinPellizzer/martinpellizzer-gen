    "intro": "Cedrela rosei, commonly known as the Brazilian cedar or rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its straight, dark brown heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has compound leaves with alternate arrangement and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by winged fruits. Cedrela rosei thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Its rapid growth rate makes it an important species for reforestation and timber production."
