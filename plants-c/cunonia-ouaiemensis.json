    "intro": "Cunonia ouaiemensis, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, dark wood, which is used in traditional crafts and musical instruments. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in its native range."
