    "intro": "Cirsium kenji-horieanum, commonly known as the Kenji Horie thistle, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is native to Japan and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. It has a short flowering period, usually in late summer, and produces small, achene-like seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
