    "intro": "Carex pichinchensis var. dura, commonly known as the hardy sedge, is a perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is known for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The plant's rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it effective for erosion control."
