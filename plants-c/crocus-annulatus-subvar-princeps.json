    "intro": "Crocus annulatus subvar. princeps, commonly known as the Persian crocus, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with a white throat, which bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spherical corms that serve as storage organs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
