It features slender, branched stems covered in a sticky, glandular coating, which gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, radially symmetrical flowers with five petals, typically in shades of red or orange. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields."
