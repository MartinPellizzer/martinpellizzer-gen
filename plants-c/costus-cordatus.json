    "intro": "Costus cordatus, commonly known as the heartleaf costus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Costaceae and is characterized by its strap-like, narrow leaves that are often heart-shaped at the base. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, emerging from the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Costus cordatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and subtle floral display."
