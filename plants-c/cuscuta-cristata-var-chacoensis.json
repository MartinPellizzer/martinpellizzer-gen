    "intro": "Cuscuta cristata var. chacoensis, commonly known as the Chaco dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to South America. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, attaching itself with specialized root-like structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat. Due to its parasitic nature, it can impact the growth and survival of its host species."
