    "intro": "Cerastium brachiatum subsp. decrescens, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom in early spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth compared to other members of the species."
