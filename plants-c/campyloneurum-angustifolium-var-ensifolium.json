    "intro": "Campyloneurum angustifolium var. ensifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed campyloneurum, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, linear leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with a distinctive, narrow shape that contributes to its common name. This variant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect light."
