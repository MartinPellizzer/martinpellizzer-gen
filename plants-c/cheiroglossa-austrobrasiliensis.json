    "intro": "Cheiroglossa austrobrasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian leaf-eared mouse, is a species of rodent native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf-like ear structures, which are a unique adaptation for camouflage. The plant, however, is not a botanical species but an animal, so there are no botanical aspects to describe. Therefore, I can't reply."
