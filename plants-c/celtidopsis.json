    "intro": "Celtidopsis, commonly known as the \"pale daisy\" or \"sacred daisy,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These plants are characterized by their compact, often succulent growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Celtidopsis species typically have a short, thick stem with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. They are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making them important components of desert ecosystems."
