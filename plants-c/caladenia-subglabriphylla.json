    "intro": "Caladenia subglabriphylla, commonly known as the Sturt's Ghost Orchid, is an orchid species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, elongated labellum. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats, often in areas with low rainfall. Its flowers bloom during the spring and summer months, and it is known for its relatively small size and unique floral structure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and threatened species."
