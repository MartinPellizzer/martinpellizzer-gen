    "intro": "Cryptocarya sclerophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically glossy and aromatic, with a strong, spicy scent. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark blue, edible berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests. Cryptocarya sclerophylla is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
