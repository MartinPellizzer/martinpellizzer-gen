    "intro": "Ceiba pubiflora f. grandiflora, commonly known as the giant ceiba or kapok tree, is a striking tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its towering height, often reaching over 50 meters, and its buttressed roots that provide stability in wet, tropical soils. The tree produces showy, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bats and insects. Its seeds are enclosed in a fibrous, cotton-like capsule, which is used in traditional medicine and as a natural fiber. The ceiba is also culturally significant in many indigenous communities, symbolizing strength and spiritual connection to the earth."
