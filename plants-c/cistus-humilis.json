    "intro": "Cistus humilis, commonly known as the low rock rose, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, woody stems and small, leathery leaves that are gray-green in color. The plant produces delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, white, and yellow, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Cistus humilis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
