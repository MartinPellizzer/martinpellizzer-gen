    "intro": "Carex hystrix, commonly known as the zigzag sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and dense clusters of spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its distinctive zigzagging inflorescence gives it its common name, and it often forms dense mats that help stabilize soil. Carex hystrix is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats."
