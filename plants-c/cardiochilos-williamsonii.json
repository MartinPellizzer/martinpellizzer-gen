It is a small perennial herb with distinctive heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to habitat loss, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
