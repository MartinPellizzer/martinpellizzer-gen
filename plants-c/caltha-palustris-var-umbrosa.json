    "intro": "Caltha palustris var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving marsh marigold, is a variant of the marsh marigold native to wetland habitats in North America. It features delicate, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role as a nectar source for early pollinators and its ability to stabilize wetland soils."
