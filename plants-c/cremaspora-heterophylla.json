    "intro": "Cremaspora heterophylla, commonly known as the variable flame tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and striking, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or well-drained soils. Its leaves are often variable in shape, hence the species name *heterophylla*, meaning \"different leaves.\" Cremaspora heterophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
