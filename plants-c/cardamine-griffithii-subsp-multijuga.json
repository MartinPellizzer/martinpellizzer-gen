    "intro": "Cardamine griffithii subsp. multijuga, commonly known as the multifoliate watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in cool, moist habitats such as stream banks and wet meadows, where it can form dense mats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, with specialized structures for water retention and nutrient absorption."
