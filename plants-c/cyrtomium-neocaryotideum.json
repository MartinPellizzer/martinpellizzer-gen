It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often adorned with small, rounded spore cases. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a dense arrangement of pinnae that give it a lush, fern-like appearance.
