These shrubs are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including pink, red, and white. The leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture. Comptonanthus species are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making them resilient to drought conditions. They are popular in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
