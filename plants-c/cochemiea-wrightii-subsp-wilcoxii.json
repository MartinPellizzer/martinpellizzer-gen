    "intro": "Cochemiea wrightii subsp. wilcoxii, commonly known as the Wilcox candelabra cactus, is a low-growing, branching cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It features a compact, rounded stem with multiple cylindrical branches that resemble candlesticks, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, with spines that provide shade and reduce water loss. Its drought tolerance and unique appearance make it a popular choice for desert gardens and rockeries."
