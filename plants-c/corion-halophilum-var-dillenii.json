It thrives in arid and coastal regions where soil salinity is high. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss and help it survive in harsh conditions. It produces small, greenish flowers that are often clustered together. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife."
