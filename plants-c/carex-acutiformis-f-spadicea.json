    "intro": "Carex acutiformis f. spadicea, commonly known as the yellow sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces spikelets that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. This plant thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The inflorescence consists of a single spike, which is often subtended by a leaf-like bract."
