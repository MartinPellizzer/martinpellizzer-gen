    "intro": "Coelogyne entomophobia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and large, showy flowers that often resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical forests. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects or other natural elements. Due to its elusive nature and habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate and is highly valued in botanical collections."
