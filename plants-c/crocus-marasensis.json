    "intro": "Crocus marasensis, commonly known as the Maras saffron crocus, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andean highlands of Peru. It is characterized by its vivid orange flowers that bloom in the early spring, typically in the months of April and May. The plant grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to the cold and harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its flowers are surrounded by a dense cluster of leaf-like bracts, which give it a unique appearance. The plant is closely associated with the traditional saffron production in the region, as its stigmas are used to produce a valuable yellow dye."
