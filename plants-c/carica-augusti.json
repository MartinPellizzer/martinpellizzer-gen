    "intro": "Carica augusti, commonly known as the Augustus papaya, is a tropical fruiting plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Caricaceae family and is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and yellow-orange flesh. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its fruit is similar to the common papaya but is less commonly cultivated due to its smaller size and lower yield. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
