    "intro": "Carum trichophyllum, commonly known as the hairy caraway, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic properties and distinctive umbel-shaped flowers. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and grows in alpine environments. The plant features finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. Its small, white flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant produces small, oval fruits that are used in traditional medicine. Carum trichophyllum is valued for its essential oils, which have been used for their purported digestive and medicinal benefits."
