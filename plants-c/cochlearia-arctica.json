It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss in its arctic habitat."
