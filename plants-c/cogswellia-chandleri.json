    "intro": "Cogswellia chandleri, commonly known as the Chandler's cactus, is a rare and unique plant native to the rocky habitats of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. Its foliage is minimal, with spines that provide protection from herbivores. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
