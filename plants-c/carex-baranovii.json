    "intro": "Carex baranovii, commonly known as Baranov's sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, greenish-brown flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wetland or riparian habitats. Carex baranovii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
