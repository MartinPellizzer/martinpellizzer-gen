    "intro": "Combretum sordidum, commonly known as the dirty flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its elongated, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in warm climates."
