    "intro": "Cornukaempferia longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with long petioles, which help in capturing light in its natural habitat. Its rhizomes are used as a starchy root vegetable, similar to traditional arrowroot. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and edible rhizomes."
