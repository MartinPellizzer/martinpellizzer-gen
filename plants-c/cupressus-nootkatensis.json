    "intro": "Cupressus nootkatensis, commonly known as the Alaska cedar, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and its distinctive, aromatic wood. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. Cupressus nootkatensis is valued for its durability and is used in construction and as a decorative plant."
