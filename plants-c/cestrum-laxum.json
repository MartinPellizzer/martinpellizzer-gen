    "intro": "Cestrum laxum, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant is noted for its fragrant, tubular flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white, pink, or purple. Its flowers are pollinated by nocturnal animals such as bats and moths, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals. Cestrum laxum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and nocturnal beauty."
