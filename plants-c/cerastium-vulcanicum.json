    "intro": "Cerastium vulcanicum, commonly known as the volcanic chickweed, is a low-growing flowering plant native to volcanic regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. It produces small, rounded fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its spread in suitable habitats. Due to its unique habitat, it is considered a rare and specialized species found primarily in volcanic areas."
