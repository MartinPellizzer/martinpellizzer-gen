    "intro": "Cyathea subbipinnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive bifurcated structure, with branches splitting into two main parts, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Cyathea subbipinnata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity."
