    "intro": "Calceolaria nevadensis subsp. nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountains in California. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
