    "intro": "Croton heterophyllus, commonly known as the variable croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its strikingly variable leaf morphology, with leaves ranging from simple to deeply lobed or even palmately compound. The plant produces small, clustered yellow-green flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Croton heterophyllus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
