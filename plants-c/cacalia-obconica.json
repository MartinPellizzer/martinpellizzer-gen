    "intro": "Cacalia obconica, commonly known as the narrowleaf bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or wildflower meadows. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
