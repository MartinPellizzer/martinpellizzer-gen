It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, scale-like foliage that turns a reddish hue in the fall. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones and has a slow growth rate, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, and it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. The tree is also valued for its aromatic wood, which has been historically used in construction and traditional crafts."
