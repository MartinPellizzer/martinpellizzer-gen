    "intro": "Caladium punctatum, commonly known as the spotted dieffenbachia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often marked with contrasting color patterns, including white, yellow, and green. The plant belongs to the Araceae family, which includes other ornamental plants like peace lilies and calla lilies. Caladium punctatum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and as a decorative plant in shaded outdoor areas."
