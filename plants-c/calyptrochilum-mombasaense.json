    "intro": "Calyptrochilum mombasaense, commonly known as Mombasa orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to coastal regions of Kenya. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters, showcasing a range of colors from white to pink. The plant has a short, upright stem and produces leaves that are narrow and linear, adapted to thrive in coastal environments. It is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils along the shores, where it benefits from the warm, humid climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
