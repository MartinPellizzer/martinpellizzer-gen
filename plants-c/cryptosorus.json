    "intro": "Cryptosorus, commonly known as the hidden moss, is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Cryptosoraceae. These plants are typically small, non-vascular, and thrive in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. They lack true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having structures called thalli that absorb nutrients directly from the substrate. Cryptosorus species are characterized by their intricate, often delicate leaf-like structures that are usually arranged in dense mats. Due to their preference for humid conditions, they are often found in temperate and tropical regions where moisture is consistently available."
