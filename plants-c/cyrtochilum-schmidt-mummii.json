    "intro": "Cyrtochilum schmidt-mummii, commonly known as the Schmidt-Mumm's orchid, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and intricate, showy flowers. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with prominent sepals and petals, often adorned with dark veins. Cyrtochilum schmidt-mummii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
