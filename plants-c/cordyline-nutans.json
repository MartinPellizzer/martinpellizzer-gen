It is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, strap-shaped leaves that often droop downward. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by dark blue berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Cordyline nutans thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its attractive foliage and resilience in shaded environments."
