    "intro": "Cineraria aurea, commonly known as the golden cineraria, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features silver-gray foliage with fuzzy textures, which help it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Cineraria aurea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
