    "intro": "Cyperus inornatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It has slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. The plant thrives in moist soil and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic wildlife. Cyperus inornatus is also used in phytoremediation efforts due to its capacity to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water."
