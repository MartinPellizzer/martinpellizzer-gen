    "intro": "Cyathea elmeri, commonly known as Elmer's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant has a thick, fibrous root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Cyathea elmeri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in humid, temperate climates with adequate shade."
