    "intro": "Cestrum cuspidatissimum, commonly known as the sharp-pointed cestrum, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshade plants, and is characterized by its tubular, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink and red, are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. Cestrum cuspidatissimum is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty and fragrance."
