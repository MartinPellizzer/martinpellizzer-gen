    "intro": "Cacalia begoniifolia, commonly known as the begonia-leaved cacalia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of begonias, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and subtle floral display."
