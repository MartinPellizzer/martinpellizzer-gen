    "intro": "Celtis tournefortii var. aspera, commonly known as the rough-leaf boxelder, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and alternate, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, spiky fruits that are edible for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and rocky habitats. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and parks."
