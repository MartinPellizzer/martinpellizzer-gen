It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its presence is an indicator of aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
