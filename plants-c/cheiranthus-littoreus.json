    "intro": "Cheiranthus littoreus, commonly known as the sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in a fine layer of white hair. Cheiranthus littoreus plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various small invertebrates."
