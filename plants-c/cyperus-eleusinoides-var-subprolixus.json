    "intro": "Cyperus eleusinoides var. subprolixus, commonly known as the swamp cyperus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it a common species in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats. It is also known for its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels, which contributes to its ecological adaptability."
