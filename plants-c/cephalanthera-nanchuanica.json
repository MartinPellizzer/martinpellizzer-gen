    "intro": "Cephalanthera nanchuanica, commonly known as the Nanchuan\u6753\u5170, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a distinctive hood-like structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
