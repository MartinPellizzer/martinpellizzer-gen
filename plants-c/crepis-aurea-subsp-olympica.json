    "intro": "Crepis aurea subsp. olympica, commonly known as the Olympic golden hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, silver- or yellowish-green leaves, which are covered in fine hairs. Its flowering stems bear small, yellowish flowers arranged in a single head, often with a distinctive yellow pappus for wind dispersal. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
