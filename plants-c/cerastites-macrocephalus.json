    "intro": "Cerastites macrocephalus, commonly known as the large-headed thornapple, is a shrub native to South Africa. It features woody stems covered in sharp spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, spiny fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Cerastites macrocephalus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
