    "intro": "Cerastium scaposum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its rosette of small, rounded leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and streambanks. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces numerous stolons, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its delicate appearance and early blooming habit make it a notable species in ecological and botanical studies."
