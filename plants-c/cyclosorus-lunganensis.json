    "intro": "Cyclosorus lunganensis, commonly known as the Lungan's water fern, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind or insects. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cyclosorus lunganensis is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health."
