    "intro": "Cornutia grandifolia f. quadrangularis, commonly known as the quadrangular cornutia, is a unique variant of the cornutia plant characterized by its distinctive quadrangular stem structure. This plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique morphology. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
