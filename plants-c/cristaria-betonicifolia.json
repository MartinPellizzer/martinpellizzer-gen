    "intro": "Cristaria betonicifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking silvery-gray foliage and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and prefers well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, hairy texture, and the flowers have five lobed petals that are often reflexed at the tips. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
