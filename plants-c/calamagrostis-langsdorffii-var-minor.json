It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are clustered along the stems, which are often adorned with fine hairs. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
