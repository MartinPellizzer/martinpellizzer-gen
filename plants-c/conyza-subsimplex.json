    "intro": "Conyza subsimplex, commonly known as the lesser dandelion, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the Americas and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, inconspicuous flower head. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds with pappus structures that aid in its spread. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including disturbed soils and open areas. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings."
