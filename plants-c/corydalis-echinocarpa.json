    "intro": "Corydalis echinocarpa, commonly known as the prickly corydalis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and its flowers have two spurred lobes at the base, a distinctive feature of the genus Corydalis. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in rocky or forested habitats. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
