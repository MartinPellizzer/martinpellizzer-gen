    "intro": "Caralluma diffusa, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of India and Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are typically reduced to small spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Caralluma diffusa is also known for its traditional use in Ayurvedic medicine for its purported health benefits."
