    "intro": "Cyathea muricata, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds. The plant has a distinctive trunk covered in rough, scaly tissue that gives it its common name. Cyathea muricata typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting pollinators."
