    "intro": "Centaurea pannosa, commonly known as the pale centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Centaurea pannosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
