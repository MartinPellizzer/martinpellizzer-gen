    "intro": "Cactus harlowii, commonly known as the Harlow's cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in desert gardens."
