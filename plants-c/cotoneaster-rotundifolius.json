    "intro": "Cotoneaster rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leaf cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes. Cotoneaster rotundifolius is relatively low maintenance and thrives in a variety of soil types."
