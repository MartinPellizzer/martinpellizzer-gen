    "intro": "Corpuscularia mollis, commonly known as the soft corpuscular plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Violaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves and clusters of small, violet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth margin, and the flowers are borne in dense inflorescences. Corpuscularia mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
