    "intro": "Calyptridium umbellatum var. caudiciferum, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows from a short, thickened stem base called a caudex, which stores water and nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for arid gardens. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular ornamental plant in native landscapes."
