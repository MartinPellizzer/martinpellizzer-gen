    "intro": "Calamagrostis podophora, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage that turns a striking coppery color in the fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
