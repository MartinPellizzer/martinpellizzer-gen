    "intro": "Carex paupercula var. brevisquama, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, which consists of narrow, grass-green leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in width. This variety thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, inconspicuous flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. The plant plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
