    "intro": "Chloris ciliata f. reptans, commonly known as the creeping hairvetch, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in temperate climates. It features slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats on the ground. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue, and the plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in early summer. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for livestock."
