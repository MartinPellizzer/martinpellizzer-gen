    "intro": "Campulosus floridanus, commonly known as the Florida campulocactus, is a rare cactus native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, typically found in dry, sandy habitats. Its unique morphology includes a branching structure and the ability to store water in its stems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
