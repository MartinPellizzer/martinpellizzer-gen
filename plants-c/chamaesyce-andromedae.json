It is a low-growing annual herb that typically thrives in sandy, coastal environments. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. It is adapted to tolerate salt spray and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh coastal habitats. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to survive in challenging, maritime climates."
