    "intro": "Celsia lyrata var. demnatensis, commonly known as the Demnat's bellflower, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. It has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its habitat."
