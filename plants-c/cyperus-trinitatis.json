    "intro": "Cyperus trinitatis, commonly known as the Trinidad sedge, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. Its slender, triangular stems are often covered in small, grass-like leaves, and it produces clusters of tiny, spike-like flowers. Cyperus trinitatis is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in coastal or inland wetlands."
