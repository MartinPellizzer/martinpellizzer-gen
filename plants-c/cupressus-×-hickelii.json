    "intro": "Cupressus \u00d7 hickelii, commonly known as the Arizona cypress, is a hybrid coniferous evergreen tree native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the cypress family (Cupressaceae) and is characterized by its scale-like leaves and aromatic wood. The plant typically grows in USDA hardiness zones 6 through 9, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. The Arizona cypress is valued for its ornamental use in landscaping due to its dense, pyramidal shape and drought tolerance."
