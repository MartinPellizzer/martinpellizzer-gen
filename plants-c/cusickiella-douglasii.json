    "intro": "Cusickiella douglasii, commonly known as the Douglas's spurge, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has smooth, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as slopes and meadows. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive member of the Euphorbiaceae family."
