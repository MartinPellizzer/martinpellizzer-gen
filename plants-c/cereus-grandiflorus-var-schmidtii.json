    "intro": "Cereus grandiflorus var. schmidtii, commonly known as the Schmidt's night bloomer, is a cacti species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure adapted to conserve water. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white and yellow. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. It is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and striking appearance."
