    "intro": "Cyperus incomtus var. miguelii, commonly known as the Mexican flatsedge, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often green or brown in color. It has a rhizomatous root system, which allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
