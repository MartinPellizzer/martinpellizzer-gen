    "intro": "Crepidium kristinianum, commonly known as the Kristinian's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense spike, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
