    "intro": "Campanula cerviana, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, silky hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Campanula cerviana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
