    "intro": "Carex howellii, commonly known as Howell's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and streambanks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Carex howellii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
