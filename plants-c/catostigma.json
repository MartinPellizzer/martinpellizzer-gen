    "intro": "Catostigma, commonly known as the false nettle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with humid climates. They typically have opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and their flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences. The stems are often hairy and can be somewhat woody in mature plants. Catostigma species are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though their botanical significance lies mainly in their ecological roles and adaptations to their native environments."
