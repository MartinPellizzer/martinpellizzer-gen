    "intro": "Cliffortia dregeana var. dregeana, commonly known as the Karoo star, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant has small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are adapted to conserve water in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on rocky outcrops or sandy plains. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
