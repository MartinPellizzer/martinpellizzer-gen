    "intro": "Criosanthes arietina, commonly known as the snow orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features striking white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, adapting to the cold and short growing season. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to extreme climates and its role in local ecosystems. Due to its fragility, it is highly susceptible to habitat loss and climate change."
