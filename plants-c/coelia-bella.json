    "intro": "Coelia bella, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, pale green or white stems and its showy, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows on the bark of trees, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it an epiphytic species. Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, Coelia bella is considered endangered in many areas."
