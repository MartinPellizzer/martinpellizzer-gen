    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple heather, is a flowering plant native to the British Isles and parts of northern Europe. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in acidic, well-drained soils, often found in heathland and moorland environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming from late summer to early autumn. Its foliage is dense and evergreen, with dark green, leathery leaves that provide year-round interest. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds."
