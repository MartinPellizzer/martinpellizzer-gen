    "intro": "Carex leporina f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf marsh sedge, is a compact, perennial sedge native to wetland habitats in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical Carex leporina. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its low-growing habit and ability to stabilize soil, it is a valuable plant for wetland restoration projects."
