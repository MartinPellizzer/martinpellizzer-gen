    "intro": "Cliffortia tabularis, commonly known as the flatleaf flax or coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and rocky habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and flat, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Cliffortia tabularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
