    "intro": "Cheilanthes rotunda, commonly known as the round-stemmed rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and is typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The plant has wiry, creeping rhizomes and produces small, clustered fronds with a leathery texture. Its spores are released from terminal, clustered sporangia on the undersides of the fronds. This fern is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in challenging conditions."
