    "intro": "Chionogentias pleurogynoides subsp. milliganii, commonly known as the Milligan's snowbell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its slender stems. The plant has small, elongated leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs, adapting to the cold, arid conditions of its habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and requires well-drained conditions to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
