It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous terrain, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its small, yellow-orange flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
