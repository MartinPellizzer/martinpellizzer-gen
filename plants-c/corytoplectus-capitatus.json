    "intro": "Corytoplectus capitatus, commonly known as the sand dollar, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the family Echinoidea. It is characterized by its flattened, disc-shaped body covered in a calcareous skeleton that resembles a flower or a dollar, hence its common name. The plant-like structure is composed of a central disc with radial spines and a series of pores that allow for gas exchange. It thrives in shallow coastal waters, particularly in sandy substrates, where it burrows through the sand. Despite its appearance, it is not a true plant but an echinoderm, playing an important role in marine ecosystems."
