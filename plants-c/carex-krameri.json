    "intro": "Carex krameri, commonly known as the Krameri sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers that are wind-pollinated. Carex krameri is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
