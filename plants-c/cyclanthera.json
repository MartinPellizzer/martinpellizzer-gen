    "intro": "Cyclanthera, commonly known as the sweet-sour gourd, is a genus of flowering plants in the Cucurbitaceae family. These plants are characterized by their vine-like growth habit and distinctive, often lobed leaves. The flowers are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Cyclanthera species produce fruits that are generally small, fleshy, and sometimes edible, though some varieties have a bitter taste. The genus is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in warm, humid climates."
