    "intro": "Cyperus maranguensis, commonly known as the Marangu grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. The inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a cylindrical cluster, which is characteristic of the Cyperaceae family."
