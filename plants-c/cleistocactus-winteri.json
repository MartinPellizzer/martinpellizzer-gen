    "intro": "Cleistocactus winteri, commonly known as the Winter's Cactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that open only at night, a feature known as nocturnal anthesis. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Cleistocactus winteri is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
