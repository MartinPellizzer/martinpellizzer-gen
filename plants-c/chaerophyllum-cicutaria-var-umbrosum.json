    "intro": "Chaerophyllum cicutaria var. umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, which are clustered in a flat-topped arrangement. The variety umbrosum is distinguished by its darker foliage and more compact growth compared to the typical form."
