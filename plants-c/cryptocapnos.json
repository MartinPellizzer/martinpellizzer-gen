    "intro": "Cryptocapnos, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its small, white, umbellate flowers that appear in late summer, often in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a delicate, herbaceous stem and narrow, fern-like leaves that are finely divided. Cryptocapnos is typically found in temperate regions, often in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
