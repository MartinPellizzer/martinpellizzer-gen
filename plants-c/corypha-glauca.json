    "intro": "Corypha glauca, commonly known as the blue corypha, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-pink flowers that are clustered in a spadix, followed by the development of large, woody fruits. Corypha glauca is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil."
