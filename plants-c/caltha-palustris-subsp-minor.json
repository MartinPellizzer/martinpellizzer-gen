    "intro": "Caltha palustris subsp. minor, commonly known as the lesser marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, acidic environments such as bogs and wet meadows. It features showy, yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201340 cm and produces small, capsule-like fruits. This subspecies is closely related to the more common Caltha palustris and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats."
