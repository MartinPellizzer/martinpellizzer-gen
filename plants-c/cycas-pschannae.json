    "intro": "Cycas pschannae, commonly known as the Hainan cycad, is a rare and ancient cycad species native to the island of Hainan in China. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces both male and female cones, with the female cones typically growing at the base of the plant. Cycas pschannae is considered a living fossil due to its evolutionary history dating back to the Mesozoic era. It is also classified as critically endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection."
