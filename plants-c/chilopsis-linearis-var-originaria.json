    "intro": "Chilopsis linearis var. originaria, commonly known as the desert four o'clock, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub that produces showy, tubular, pink to purple flowers. The plant has slender, linear leaves and is adapted to arid environments, thriving in full sun. It blooms in the late afternoon, hence its common name, and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. The flowers attract hummingbirds and other pollinators, making it an important species in local ecosystems."
