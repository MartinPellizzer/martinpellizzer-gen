    "intro": "Conyza marilandica, commonly known as horseweed, is an annual flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. Its leaves are hairy and alternate, with a distinctive grayish-white coloration. Horseweed produces small yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, which are easily dispersed by the wind."
