    "intro": "Centropogon grandidentatus var. australis, commonly known as the Australian sword fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped, erect fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat."
