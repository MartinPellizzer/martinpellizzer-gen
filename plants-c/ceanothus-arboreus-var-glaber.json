    "intro": "Ceanothus arboreus var. glaber, commonly known as the smooth tree ceanothus, is a shrub or small tree native to California. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are typically leathery and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral ecosystems. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
