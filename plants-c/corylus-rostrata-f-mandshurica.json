This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive elongated, rostrate (beak-like) nutlets, which are typically covered in dense, glandular hairs. It thrives in temperate climates, often growing in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant produces small, yellowish male flowers and female flowers in catkins, typical of the Corylus genus. Its nuts are edible and have been traditionally used in local cuisines and herbal remedies."
