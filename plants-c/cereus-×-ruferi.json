    "intro": "Cereus \u00d7 ruferi, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a hybrid cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. These flowers emit a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its succulent leaves and stems are adapted to store water, making it well-suited for arid environments."
