    "intro": "Chevaliera lingulata, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Chevaliera lingulata is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for various pollinators."
