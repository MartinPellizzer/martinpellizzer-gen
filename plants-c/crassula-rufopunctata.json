It features fleshy, triangular leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially under direct sunlight. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Crassula rufopunctata is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
