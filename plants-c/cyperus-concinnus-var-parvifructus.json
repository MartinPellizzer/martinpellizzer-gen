The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of water bodies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
