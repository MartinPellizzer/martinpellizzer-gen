    "intro": "Caladenia longicauda subsp. insularis, commonly known as the Lord Howe Island spider-orchid, is an endemic orchid species found exclusively on Lord Howe Island. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stem and a single, narrow, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive hood-like labellum. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. It relies on specific pollinators, primarily flies, for reproduction. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat fragility, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and invasive species."
