    "intro": "Carex alta var. gymnocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-seeded tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, greenish flowers that mature into dark brown, three-angled berries. The smooth, glossy seeds are adapted for wind dispersal, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
