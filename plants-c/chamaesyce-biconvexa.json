The plant features small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a waxy surface and a distinctive biconvex shape, contributing to its common name. Chamaesyce biconvexa is adapted to arid environments and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dune habitats."
