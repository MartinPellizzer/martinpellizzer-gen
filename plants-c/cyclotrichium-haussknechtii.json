    "intro": "Cyclotrichium haussknechtii, commonly known as the Hausseckner's cyclotrichium, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It features narrow, linear leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
