    "intro": "Cirsium pulchellum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its smooth, less hairy stems distinguish it from other thistle species. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
