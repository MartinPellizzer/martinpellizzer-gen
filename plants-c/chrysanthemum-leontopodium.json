    "intro": "Chrysanthemum leontopodium, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its white, woolly petals and fuzzy, velvety leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments. The plant thrives in rocky, high-altitude habitats where it is exposed to strong winds and intense sunlight. Its flowers bloom in late summer and early autumn, producing a striking contrast against the harsh mountain landscape. Due to its rarity and association with resilience, the edelweiss has become a symbol of alpine beauty and ecological adaptation."
