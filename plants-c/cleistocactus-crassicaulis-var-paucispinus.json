    "intro": "Cleistocactus crassicaulis var. paucispinus, commonly known as the woolly giant cactus, is a species native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are covered in dense, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in arid conditions with minimal water. Its unique appearance and adaptation to extreme environments make it a striking example of desert flora."
