    "intro": "Cyperus deeringianus, commonly known as the Florida flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. Cyperus deeringianus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and remediate contaminated soils."
