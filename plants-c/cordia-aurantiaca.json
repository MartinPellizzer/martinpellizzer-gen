    "intro": "Cordia aurantiaca, commonly known as the red mangrove or red mangrove tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Boraginaceae. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly coastal areas where it thrives in saline and brackish water environments. The plant is characterized by its thick, corky bark and pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its small, yellowish flowers are followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that contain several seeds. Cordia aurantiaca plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
