    "intro": "Clusia nipensis, commonly known as the waxleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow, followed by orange or red berries. Clusia nipensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its ability to thrive in shaded environments and its low maintenance requirements. It is also valued for its air-purifying properties and ability to tolerate urban conditions."
