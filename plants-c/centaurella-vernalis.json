    "intro": "Centaurella vernalis, commonly known as spring centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb with slender stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant produces small, spiny seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in disturbed soils. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes and gravelly soils. Its botanical features make it a characteristic species of Mediterranean and semi-arid regions."
