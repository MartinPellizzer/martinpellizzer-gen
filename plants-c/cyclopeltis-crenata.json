    "intro": "Cyclopeltis crenata, commonly known as the crested fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, overlapping fronds that form a rosette-like structure, often with a wavy or serrated edge. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are usually green and can vary in size depending on the conditions. Cyclopeltis crenata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
