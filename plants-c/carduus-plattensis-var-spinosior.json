    "intro": "Carduus plattensis var. spinosior, commonly known as the spiny field thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, gray-green, lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in some regions but also has historical uses in herbal medicine."
