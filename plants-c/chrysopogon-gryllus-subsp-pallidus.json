    "intro": "Chrysopogon gryllus subsp. pallidus, commonly known as the pale grasshopper grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to yellowish flowers. It has fibrous roots and is often used in erosion control due to its dense growth and drought tolerance. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional medicine in some regions."
