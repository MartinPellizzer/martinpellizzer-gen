    "intro": "Castilleja lutescens, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately compound, with small, linear leaflets. Castilleja lutescens typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe."
