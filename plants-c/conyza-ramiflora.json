    "intro": "Conyza ramiflora, commonly known as the clustered fleabane, is an annual herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features a branching stem covered in fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Conyza ramiflora is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas, making it both a weed and a potential forage plant."
