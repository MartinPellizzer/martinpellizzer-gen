    "intro": "Cuscuta lupuliformis subsp. asiatica, commonly known as the Asian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to regions of Asia and is often found on various herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can thrive in a wide range of environmental conditions. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause damage to agricultural crops and ornamental plants."
