    "intro": "Catanthera kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Bornean catanthera, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in the cool, moist climate of the mountain's cloud forest ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
