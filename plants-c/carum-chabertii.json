    "intro": "Carum chabertii, commonly known as Chabert's caraway, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are often used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
