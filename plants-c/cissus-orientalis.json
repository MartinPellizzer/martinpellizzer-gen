    "intro": "Cissus orientalis, commonly known as the rock fig or creeping fig, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and rapid growth habit. The plant has a thick, woody stem that can root at the nodes, allowing it to climb and spread over surfaces. Its small, greenish-white flowers are followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are often consumed by wildlife. Cissus orientalis is well adapted to arid conditions and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
