    "intro": "Crepis hieracioides, commonly known as the hairy hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its yellow ray florets and a central disk of tubular flowers, typical of the Compositae family. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and often grows in dry, disturbed soils. Crepis hieracioides is typically found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats."
