    "intro": "Crataegus tanacetifolia var. monstrosa, commonly known as the strange hawthorn, is a variant of the hawthorn species characterized by its distinctive and often bizarre growth forms. It is native to parts of Europe and is known for its thorny branches and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically harvested in the fall. Its unique morphology, including twisted stems and unusual leaf shapes, makes it a striking ornamental plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in woodland edges or hedgerows."
