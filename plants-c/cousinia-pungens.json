    "intro": "Cousinia pungens, commonly known as the spiked gentian, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense clusters of blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has wiry, leafless stems that often form a basal rosette, and its leaves are narrow, grayish-green, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to rocky or sandy habitats. Cousinia pungens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking floral display and hardy nature."
