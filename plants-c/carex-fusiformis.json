    "intro": "Carex fusiformis, commonly known as the spindle sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. Carex fusiformis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
