    "intro": "Coryanthes seegeri, commonly known as the Seeger's coryanthe, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 20 centimeters in diameter, featuring a distinctive red and yellow coloration. The plant produces a single, intricate flower per stem, which is often adorned with a unique, helmet-like structure at the base. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of air humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
