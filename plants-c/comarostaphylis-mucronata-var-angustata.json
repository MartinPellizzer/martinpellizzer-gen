    "intro": "Comarostaphylis mucronata var. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandmat, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its linear, often hairy leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh environments. This species is often found in coastal dunes and inland sandplains, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
