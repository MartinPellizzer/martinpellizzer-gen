    "intro": "Calamus sarawakensis, commonly known as the Sarawak calamus, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is a tall, slender palm-like plant that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with a robust rhizome system. The plant produces long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and as natural fiber sources. Its flowering stems bear small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically followed by the development of clustered fruit. Due to habitat loss, Calamus sarawakensis is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native ecosystems."
