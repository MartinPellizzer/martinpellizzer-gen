It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters.

It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in warm climates. This variety is valued both for its aromatic seeds and its ornamental foliage."
