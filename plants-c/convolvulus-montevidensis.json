    "intro": "Convolvulus montevidensis, commonly known as the Montevideo morning glory, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bindweed family (Convolvulaceae) and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in some regions."
