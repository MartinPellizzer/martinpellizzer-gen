It is characterized by its large, showy blue-violet petals that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface, which help it retain moisture in its humid environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique floral structure also attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
