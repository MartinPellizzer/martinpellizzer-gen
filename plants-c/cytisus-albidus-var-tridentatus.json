    "intro": "Cytisus albidus var. tridentatus, commonly known as the white broom or tridentate broom, is a flowering shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, trifoliate leaves that give it its varietal name \"tridentatus.\" The plant produces clusters of yellow, pea-like flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
