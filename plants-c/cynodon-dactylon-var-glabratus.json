    "intro": "Cynodon dactylon var. glabratus, commonly known as Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and widely distributed in warm climates. It is characterized by its coarse, bluish-green leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in a variety of soil types and environmental conditions. It is highly drought-tolerant and often used for erosion control and lawn turf. Its ability to spread through both rhizomes and stolons makes it a persistent and invasive species in many regions."
