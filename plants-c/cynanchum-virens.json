    "intro": "Cynanchum virens, commonly known as green milkweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes other milkweeds, and is characterized by its milky sap. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring opposite, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal. Cynanchum virens is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
