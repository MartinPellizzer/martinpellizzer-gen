    "intro": "Calanthe finisterrae, commonly known as the Canary Islands calanthe, is a rare orchid species native to the Canary Islands. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a pseudobulb and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a single spike bearing several showy, pale pink to white flowers with distinctive purple markings. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to the volcanic soils of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
