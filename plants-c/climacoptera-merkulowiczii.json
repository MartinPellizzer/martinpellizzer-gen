It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with intricate patterns. The plant has a compact growth habit, with hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
