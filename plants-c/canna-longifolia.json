    "intro": "Canna longifolia, commonly known as the giant cannas, is a striking tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, showy leaves that can reach up to three feet in length, and its vibrant, spadix-like flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant thrives in wet, sunny environments and is often found near water bodies such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a popular ornamental and a potential invasive species. Canna longifolia is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to provide habitat for various wildlife species."
