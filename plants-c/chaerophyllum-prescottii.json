    "intro": "Chaerophyllum prescottii, commonly known as Prescott's cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It produces small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
