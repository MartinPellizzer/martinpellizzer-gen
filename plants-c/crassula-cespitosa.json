It features dense, low-growing clusters of fleshy, thick leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Crassula cespitosa is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its compact form and attractive foliage."
