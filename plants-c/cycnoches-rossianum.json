    "intro": "Cycnoches rossianum, commonly known as the Rossian water orchid, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and wetlands. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, and it plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystem balance. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
