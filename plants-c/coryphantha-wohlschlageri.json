    "intro": "Coryphantha wohlschlageri, commonly known as the Wohlschlager's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Coryphantha wohlschlageri is well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures."
