    "intro": "Corylus colchica, commonly known as the Turkish hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its oval, serrated leaves and produces catkin-like male flowers followed by female flowers that develop into edible nuts. The plant typically grows in sunny, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its nuts are smaller and more bitter than those of common hazelnuts, making them less commercially cultivated. Corylus colchica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
