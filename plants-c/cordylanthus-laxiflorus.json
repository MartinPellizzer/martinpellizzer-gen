It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland valleys. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
