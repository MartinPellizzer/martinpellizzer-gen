    "intro": "Chamaecrista ciliolata var. caprina, commonly known as the caprine sicklepod, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions."
