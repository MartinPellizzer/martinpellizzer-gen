    "intro": "Crypsis aculeata var. minima, commonly known as the lesser spiny cryptogam, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features narrow, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale in color, adapted for pollination by wind or insects. Its stems are covered in fine, spiny hairs, which provide protection against herbivores. This variant is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to survive in low-nutrient conditions."
