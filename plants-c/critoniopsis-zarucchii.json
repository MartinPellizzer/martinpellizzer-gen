    "intro": "Critoniopsis zarucchii, commonly known as the Zarucchii's bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. It has delicate, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
