    "intro": "Carex paradoxa f. interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted sedge, is a variant of the broad-leaved sedge native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often interrupted by short, sterile shoots, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or wet meadows. Its inflorescence consists of a single, erect spike of small, greenish-brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This form is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
