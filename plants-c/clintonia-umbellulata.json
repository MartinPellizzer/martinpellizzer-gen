    "intro": "Clintonia umbellulata, commonly known as the white-flowered dogwood, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Its leaves are broad, elliptical, and have a smooth texture, often turning reddish in the fall. Clintonia umbellulata thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments."
