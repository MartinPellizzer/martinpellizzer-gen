It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is typically found growing near the shoreline or in mangrove swamps. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves and bears white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Its fruits contain one to three seeds, which are used to produce coffee beans. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to saline and waterlogged soils, making it an important plant in coastal ecosystems."
