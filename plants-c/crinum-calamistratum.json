It is characterized by its tall, straight stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, bearing large, showy white or pale pink flowers. The plant has strap-shaped, narrow leaves that are arranged in a rosette at the base. Its bulbs are clustered and serve as storage organs, allowing the plant to survive dry periods. Crinum calamistratum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to full sun and well-drained soil."
