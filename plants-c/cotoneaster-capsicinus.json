    "intro": "Cotoneaster capsicinus, commonly known as the Mexican cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and small mammals. Cotoneaster capsicinus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade conditions."
