    "intro": "Cousinia subappendiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant features linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Cousinia subappendiculata is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations."
