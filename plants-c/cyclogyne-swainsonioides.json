    "intro": "Cyclogyne swainsonioides, commonly known as the Swainson's cyclogyne, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. The plant features palmate leaves with lobed edges, and its flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences. Cyclogyne swainsonioides is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid and nutrient-rich soil conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
