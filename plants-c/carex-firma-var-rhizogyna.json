    "intro": "Carex firma var. rhizogyna, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly glossy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike of small, brownish flowers. This variety is notable for its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable environments."
