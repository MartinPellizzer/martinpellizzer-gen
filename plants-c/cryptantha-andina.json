    "intro": "Cryptantha andina, commonly known as the Andean cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Cryptantha andina plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for small herbivores."
