    "intro": "Ceratosanthes gracilis, commonly known as the slender horned vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its slender, climbing habit allows it to thrive in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The seeds are enclosed in elongated pods, which split open to release the seeds when mature."
