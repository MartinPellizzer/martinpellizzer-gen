    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-seed weed, is a variant of the common chickweed. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, heart-shaped leaves and white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are typically less than 5 mm in diameter, distinguishing it from the standard variety. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a common weed with ecological and agricultural significance."
