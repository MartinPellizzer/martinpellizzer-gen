    "intro": "Cerasus karabastaviensis, commonly known as the Karabastan cherry, is a rare species of cherry native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its small, dark red to black fruits that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and it produces fragrant white flowers in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
