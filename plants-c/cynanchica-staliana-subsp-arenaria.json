    "intro": "Cynanchica staliana subsp. arenaria, commonly known as the sand dune milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It plays a vital role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat."
