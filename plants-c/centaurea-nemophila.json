    "intro": "Centaurea nemophila, commonly known as the wood-centaury, is a flowering plant native to the forests of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking blue or purple flower heads that are composed of numerous tiny florets. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and undergrowth. Centaurea nemophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
