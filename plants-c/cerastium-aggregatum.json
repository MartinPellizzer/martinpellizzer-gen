    "intro": "Cerastium aggregatum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Cerastium aggregatum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
