    "intro": "Carduncellus araneosus subsp. pseudomitissimus, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical stems and large, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has silvery-white, woolly hairs covering its leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and wastelands. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
