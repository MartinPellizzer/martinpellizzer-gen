    "intro": "Cistus villosus var. dalmaticus, commonly known as the Dalmatian rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and coastal environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
