    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia var. scheuchseriformis, commonly known as the Scheuchzer's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its rounded, often hairy leaves and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and flower structure compared to the typical form of Campanula rotundifolia."
