    "intro": "Cojoba urbanii, commonly known as the sea grape, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that resemble grapes, which are often used in culinary applications. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, seed-containing fruits. It thrives in saline environments and is commonly found in mangrove swamps and coastal areas. Cojoba urbanii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
