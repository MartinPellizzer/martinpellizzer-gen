    "intro": "Chrysosplenium alternifolium f. tetrandrum, commonly known as the four-threaded chrysosplenium, is a variant of the broadleaf chrysosplenium. It is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive silver-white underside, and its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. The f. tetrandrum form is notable for its four stamens in each flower, a characteristic that distinguishes it from other forms of the species."
