    "intro": "Carex leucolepis, commonly known as the silver-spike sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its silver-gray sheaths and pale green leaves give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. Carex leucolepis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse ecosystems."
