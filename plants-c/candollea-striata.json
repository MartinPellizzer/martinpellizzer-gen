    "intro": "Candollea striata, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its distinctive, wavy, and often zigzagging fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are pinnate, with small, ovate pinnae that are often arranged in a striking, undulating pattern. Candollea striata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
