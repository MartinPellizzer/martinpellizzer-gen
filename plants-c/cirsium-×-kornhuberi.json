    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 kornhuberi, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its spiny, purple to pink flowering heads and deeply lobed, silvery-green leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and thrives in full sun. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Cirsium vulgare and Cirsium palustre. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens despite its prickly nature."
