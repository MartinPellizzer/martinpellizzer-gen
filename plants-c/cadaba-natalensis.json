    "intro": "Cadaba natalensis, commonly known as Natal rock fig, is a small, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
