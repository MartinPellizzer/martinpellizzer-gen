    "intro": "Carphobolus poeppigianus, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with erect, branching stems that often have a reddish tinge. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The species is known for its ability to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
