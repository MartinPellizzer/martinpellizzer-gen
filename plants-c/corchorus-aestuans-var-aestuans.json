    "intro": "Corchorus aestuans var. aestuans, commonly known as sea spurge, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has palmate leaves with lobed margins, and it thrives in sandy or rocky soils near the shore. It is often found in salt marshes and tidal zones, where it tolerates high salinity and periodic flooding. Sea spurge is a hardy perennial that plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small insects and birds."
