It includes both herbaceous perennials and shrubs, often characterized by their fragrant, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are typically opposite and heart-shaped, with a rough texture. Many species are cultivated for their ornamental value and edible flowers.
