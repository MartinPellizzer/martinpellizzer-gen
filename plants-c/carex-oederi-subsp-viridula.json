    "intro": "Carex oederi subsp. viridula, commonly known as the green sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
