    "intro": "Colchicum guadarramense, commonly known as the Guadarramense meadow saffron, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its striking purple to lilac-colored flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a distinctive corm-like structure, which serves as its storage organ. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, typically appearing after the flowers have faded. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable and is of significant interest in botanical conservation efforts."
