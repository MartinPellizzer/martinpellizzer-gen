    "intro": "Coincya transtagana, commonly known as the glass frog, is a small, leaf-like plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that allow the internal structures to be visible, giving it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth, glossy surface. Coincya transtagana is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its aesthetic qualities."
