    "intro": "Cylactis arcticus subsp. acaulis, commonly known as the arctic bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic regions. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Due to its specialized adaptations, it plays a vital role in the ecological balance of Arctic ecosystems."
