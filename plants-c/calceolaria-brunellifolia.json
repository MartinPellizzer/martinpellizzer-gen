    "intro": "Calceolaria brunellifolia, commonly known as the Andean slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive calyx-like structure that resembles a slipper, which is both a unique botanical feature and a key identifier. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its flowers are usually pale blue or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Calceolaria brunellifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil and cool temperatures."
