    "intro": "Coryphopteris krayanensis, commonly known as the Krayan holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it receives indirect light. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Coryphopteris krayanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
