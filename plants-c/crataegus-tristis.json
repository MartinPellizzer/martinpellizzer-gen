    "intro": "Crataegus tristis, commonly known as the sad hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20136 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pinkish flowers in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with serrated edges, and turn yellow or red in autumn. Crataegus tristis is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, and it has historical uses in traditional medicine."
