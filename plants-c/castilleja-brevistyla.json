    "intro": "Castilleja brevistyla, commonly known as the shortstyle milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. Its bright orange to red flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Castilleja brevistyla is often found in association with grasses and forbs, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
