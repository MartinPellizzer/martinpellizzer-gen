It features dense, silver-gray foliage with small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. It is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects such as ladybugs and lacewings."
