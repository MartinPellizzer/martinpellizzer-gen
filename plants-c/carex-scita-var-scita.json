It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, rushes, and grasses. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in three ranks, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Carex scita var. scita is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
