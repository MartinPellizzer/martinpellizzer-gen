    "intro": "Carex banksii f. ochrostachys, commonly known as the white-stemmed sedge, is a distinctive variant of the Carex genus. It is characterized by its pale, almost white stems that contrast with its dark green foliage. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wetlands, where it thrives in full to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a dense, clumping growth habit. The inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the sedge family."
