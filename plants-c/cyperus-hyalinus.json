    "intro": "Cyperus hyalinus, commonly known as the glassy flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that often have a waxy, glassy appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in wetland and marshy environments. Cyperus hyalinus produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its ecological role includes providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems."
