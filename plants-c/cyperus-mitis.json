It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or muddy environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Cyperus mitis has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
