    "intro": "Chamaedaphne crispa, commonly known as the rough-leaved evergreen, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It typically grows in wet, acidic soils along the edges of bogs and swamps. Chamaedaphne crispa plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
