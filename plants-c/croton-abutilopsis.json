    "intro": "Croton abutilopsis, commonly known as the velvetleaf croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny capsules containing seeds. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its striking appearance. However, it is considered invasive in some regions, posing a threat to native ecosystems."
