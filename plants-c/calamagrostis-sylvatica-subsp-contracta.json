    "intro": "Calamagrostis sylvatica subsp. contracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluejoint, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often used in wetland restoration projects."
