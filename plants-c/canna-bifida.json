    "intro": "Canna bifida, commonly known as the split canna, is a striking ornamental plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, often with a distinctive split or lobed appearance. The plant produces showy, tropical-looking flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late summer. Canna bifida thrives in moist, well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for water gardens and tropical landscapes. Its robust growth and vibrant foliage make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and ecological gardens."
