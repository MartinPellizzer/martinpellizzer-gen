    "intro": "Centaurea jacea var. nigra, commonly known as black knapweed, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and western Asia. It features upright, branching stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces striking purple to pink flowers arranged in a composite head, surrounded by bracts that are dark purple to black. The dark-colored bracts give the plant its common name and contribute to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas."
