    "intro": "Copernicia brittonorum var. sabaloense, commonly known as the Sabalo palm, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. It is a small to medium-sized tree, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with a slender trunk and a crown of pinnate leaves. The plant is characterized by its dense, fibrous leaves and produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to salt spray and sandy soils. The Sabalo palm is valued for its ornamental qualities and has cultural significance in the regions where it is found."
