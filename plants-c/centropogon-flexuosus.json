    "intro": "Centropogon flexuosus, commonly known as the slender false arum, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features a short, stocky rhizome and produces striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant's inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, relying on insect pollination for reproduction. Centropogon flexuosus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in marshy areas along riverbanks."
