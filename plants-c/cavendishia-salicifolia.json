    "intro": "Cavendishia salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaf orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, willow-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom throughout the year. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses and as a houseplant."
