    "intro": "Cryptocarya alticola, commonly known as the mountain cryptocarya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to New Zealand and is typically found growing in cool, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. It produces small, dark berries that are an important food source for native birds and insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
