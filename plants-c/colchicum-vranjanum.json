    "intro": "Colchicum vranjanum, commonly known as the Vranjean's colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the family Colchicaceae and is characterized by its striking purple to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a bulbous corm, which serves as its storage organ and allows it to survive in harsh conditions. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and often covered in a waxy coating. Colchicum vranjanum is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
