It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like crown and its ability to thrive in arid, rocky environments. The plant has spirally arranged leaves that are scale-like, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human activity."
