    "intro": "Crotalaria evolvuloides, commonly known as the narrowleaf cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive spurred flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange with a unique, spurred shape. Crotalaria evolvuloides is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable in agricultural settings. However, some species in the genus Crotalaria can be toxic to livestock, so care must be taken with its cultivation."
