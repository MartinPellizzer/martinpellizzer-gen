    "intro": "Chenopodium integrifolium subsp. ramosissimum, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with numerous branches and spiny leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a rough, textured surface. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, followed by edible, tangy berries that are used in some traditional cuisines. This species is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils."
