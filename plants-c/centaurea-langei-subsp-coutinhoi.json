    "intro": "Centaurea langei subsp. coutinhoi, commonly known as the Coutinho's cornflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and coastal areas. It is a perennial herb with a compact growth habit and produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
