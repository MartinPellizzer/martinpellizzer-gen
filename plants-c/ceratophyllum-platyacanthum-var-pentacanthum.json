It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, scale-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. It is a submerged plant that plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic organisms. Its unique morphology and ecological importance make it a notable species in freshwater ecosystems."
