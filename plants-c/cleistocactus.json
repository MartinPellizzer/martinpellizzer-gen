    "intro": "Cleistocactus, commonly known as the \"closed flower cactus,\" is a genus of cacti native to South America. These plants are characterized by their compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems. They produce small, often hidden flowers that bloom at night, a feature that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, and they close shortly after opening, giving the plant its name. Cleistocactus species are adapted to arid environments and require well-draining soil and minimal water."
