    "intro": "Cordia rotata, commonly known as the red mangrove or mangrove apple, is a tropical plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a small to medium-sized tree that thrives in brackish or saltwater environments, often found in mangrove swamps. The plant has smooth, greyish bark and produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Cordia rotata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
