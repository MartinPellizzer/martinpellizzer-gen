    "intro": "Cenchrus nervosus, commonly known as rigid grass or narrow-veined grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Cenchrus nervosus is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant."
