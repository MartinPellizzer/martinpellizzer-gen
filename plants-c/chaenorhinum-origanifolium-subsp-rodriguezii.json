    "intro": "Chaenorhinum origanifolium subsp. rodriguezii, commonly known as Rodriguez's dwarf toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of bright yellow, tubular flowers. The plant has slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of oregano. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
