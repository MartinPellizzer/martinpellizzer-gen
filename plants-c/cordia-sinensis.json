    "intro": "Cordia sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese red cedar, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, featuring smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Cordia sinensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
