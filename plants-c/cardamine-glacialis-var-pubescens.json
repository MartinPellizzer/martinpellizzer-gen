    "intro": "Cardamine glacialis var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent glacier buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and North America. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy, giving it its varietal name \"pubescens.\" The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Its foliage and flowers are covered in fine pubescence, which helps to protect it from harsh environmental conditions."
