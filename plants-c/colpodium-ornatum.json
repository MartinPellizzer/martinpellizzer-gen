    "intro": "Colpodium ornatum, commonly known as the showy colpodium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. Colpodium ornatum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and is often found in rich, well-drained soil."
