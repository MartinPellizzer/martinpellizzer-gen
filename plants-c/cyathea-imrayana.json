    "intro": "Cyathea imrayana, commonly known as the Imrayan tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, shaded environments. Cyathea imrayana plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and habitat for various organisms."
