    "intro": "Cotyledon umbilicata, commonly known as the \"Beaded Window Leaf,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often adorned with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. Its leaves are coated with a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Cotyledon umbilicata is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
