    "intro": "Clematis ligusticifolia, commonly known as the purple clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets, often with a reddish or purple tinge on the underside. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of blue or purple. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental climbers. Its vigorous growth habit requires support structures, and it is relatively disease-resistant."
