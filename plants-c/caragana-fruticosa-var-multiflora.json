It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, compound leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, followed by pea-like pods containing several seeds. It is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and hardy nature.
