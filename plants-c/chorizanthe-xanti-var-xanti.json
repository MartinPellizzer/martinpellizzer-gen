    "intro": "Chorizanthe xanti var. xanti, commonly known as desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions with minimal water."
