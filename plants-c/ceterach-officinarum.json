It thrives in rocky, sandy, or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and cliffs. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth habit with small, glossy, lance-shaped leaves. Its fronds are typically dark green and can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. Ceterach officinarum is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
