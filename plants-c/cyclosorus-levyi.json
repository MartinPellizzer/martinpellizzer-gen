    "intro": "Cyclosorus levyi, commonly known as the velvetleaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with a distinctive appearance that aids in its identification. Cyclosorus levyi plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling."
