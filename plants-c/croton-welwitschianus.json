    "intro": "Croton welwitschianus, commonly known as the giant croton, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique foliage, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
