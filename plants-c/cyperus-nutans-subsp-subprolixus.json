    "intro": "Cyperus nutans subsp. subprolixus, commonly known as the spreading flatsedge, is a grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along water edges, where it thrives in moist soil conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-sided spikes, which are often covered in short, bristly hairs. This subspecies is distinguished by its longer, more spreading inflorescence compared to the typical form of Cyperus nutans."
