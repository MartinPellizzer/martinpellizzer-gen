    "intro": "Condalia divaricata, commonly known as the silver tree, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. The silver tree is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appearance."
