    "intro": "Chenopodium detestans, commonly known as bitter goosefoot, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its rough, serrated leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. Due to its bitter taste, it is generally considered a weed but can be used in some traditional herbal remedies."
