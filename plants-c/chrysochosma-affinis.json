It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features linear, grass-like leaves and produces small yellow to golden flowers that bloom in the summer months. Chrysochosma affinis is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its botanical structure supports its role as a pioneer species in disturbed soils."
