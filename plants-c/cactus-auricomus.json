    "intro": "Cactus auricomus, commonly known as the ear cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive ear-shaped stems that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, spiny structure. It has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
