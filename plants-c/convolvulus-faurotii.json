    "intro": "Convolvulus faurotii, commonly known as the desert crown, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant has a trailing growth habit with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Convolvulus faurotii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
