It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange to red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage. Croton trichophorus is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
