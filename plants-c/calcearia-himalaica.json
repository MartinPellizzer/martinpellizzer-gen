    "intro": "Calcearia himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan snowbell, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh mountain conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calcearia himalaica is considered a vulnerable species."
