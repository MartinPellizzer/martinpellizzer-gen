    "intro": "Cypripedium palangshanense, commonly known as the Palangshan lady's slipper, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that feature a pouch-like lip and a greenish-yellow coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its leaves are broad and ovate, and it produces a single flower per stem during the spring season. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
