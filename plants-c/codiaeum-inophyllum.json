    "intro": "Codiaeum inophyllum, commonly known as the flame leaf plant, is a strikingly ornamental shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful leaves that display shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with intricate patterns. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is valued for its foliage rather than its flowers, which are small and inconspicuous. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Codiaeum inophyllum is often used in landscaping and as a potted plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
