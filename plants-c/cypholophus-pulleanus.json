    "intro": "Cypholophus pulleanus, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its extreme habitat. Cypholophus pulleanus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates."
