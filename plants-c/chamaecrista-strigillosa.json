    "intro": "Chamaecrista strigillosa, commonly known as the hairy burr legume, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive, hairy, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It belongs to the legume family (Fabaceae), which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Chamaecrista strigillosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
