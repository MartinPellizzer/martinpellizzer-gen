    "intro": "Cleistachne, commonly known as the \"closed grain\" or \"closed spike,\" is a genus of grasses belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its compact, often cylindrical inflorescence, which is typically enclosed by a sheath of bracts. The flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with reduced floral structures, which is why the plant is sometimes referred to as cleistachne, derived from the Greek for \"closed.\" These grasses are often found in moist or swampy habitats, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Cleistachne species are not widely cultivated but are of interest in botanical studies due to their unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
