    "intro": "Carya alba var. ovalis, commonly known as the oval hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the walnut family (Juglandaceae) and is characterized by its oval-shaped nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. The tree produces alternate, simple leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin. Its bark is grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age, while its flowers are dioecious, with separate male and female plants. The oval hickory is valued for its hard, heavy wood and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland habitats."
