    "intro": "Cyrtococcum chaetophoron, commonly known as the hairy crust lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms dense, crust-like growths on rock surfaces. It is characterized by a pale to dark green thallus with a distinctive, hairy texture on its upper surface. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on a symbiotic relationship between algae and fungi for nutrition. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Its slow growth and specialized habitat make it an important indicator species for environmental health."
