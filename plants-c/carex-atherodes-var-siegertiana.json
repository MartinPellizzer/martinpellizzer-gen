    "intro": "Carex atherodes var. siegertiana, commonly known as the Siegert's sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it often forms dense clumps. It is valued in wetland restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
