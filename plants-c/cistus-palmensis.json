    "intro": "Cistus palmensis, commonly known as the Canary Island rock rose, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of pink to reddish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. It has small, leathery leaves and produces capsules that contain numerous small, dry seeds. Cistus palmensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
