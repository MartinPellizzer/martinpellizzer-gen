    "intro": "Callicarpa dentata, commonly known as the Chinese beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of vibrant purple berries that appear in the fall. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil. The berries are edible for humans and birds but are often consumed by wildlife rather than cultivated for food."
