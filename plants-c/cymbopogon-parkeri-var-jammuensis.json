It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinct aromatic scent. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous and alpine habitats. Due to its unique fragrance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
