    "intro": "Caenopteris fumarioides, commonly known as the smoke fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, light green fronds that resemble smoke in appearance, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that are closely spaced. Caenopteris fumarioides thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
