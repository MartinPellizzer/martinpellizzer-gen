    "intro": "Corynostylis albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered corynostylis, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of northern Australia, particularly in Queensland. This plant is characterized by its delicate, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette near the ground. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
