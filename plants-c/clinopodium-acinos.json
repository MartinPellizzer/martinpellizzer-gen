    "intro": "Clinopodium acinos, commonly known as alpine oregano, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it forms dense mats or low shrubs. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves that are aromatic and covered in fine hairs. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Clinopodium acinos is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
