    "intro": "Cephalanthera lancifolia, commonly known as the lancolate orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its striking, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while the flowers are borne on tall, slender stems. Cephalanthera lancifolia is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, relying instead on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption."
