It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its most notable botanical feature is the production of a yellow-orange dye from its flowers, similar to saffron. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats."
