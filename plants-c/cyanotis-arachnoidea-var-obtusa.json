    "intro": "Cyanotis arachnoidea var. obtusa, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its specialized adaptations for underwater life. It features small, bladder-like structures called pneumatophores, which help in gas exchange and buoyancy. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer that aids in trapping oxygen and reducing water loss. This variant is distinguished by its obtuse leaf shape and dense, woolly appearance, setting it apart from other members of the genus."
