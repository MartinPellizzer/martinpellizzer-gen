    "intro": "Cybianthus longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved cybianthus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of coastal scrub habitats. It is a perennial herb that plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems through its extensive root system. Due to habitat loss and development, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
