    "intro": "Cyperus uniflorus var. floribundus, commonly known as the purple flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like stems with narrow, pale green to blue-gray leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, violet to purple spikelets at the tips of its stems, which are its most distinctive botanical feature. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an aggressive weed in wetland ecosystems."
