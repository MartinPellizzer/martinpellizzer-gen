    "intro": "Caladium bicolor var. poecile, commonly known as the \"Candy Stripe\" caladium, is a tropical perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful leaves that display patterns of red, white, and green. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its foliage is the main attraction, as it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are not typically visible above the leaves. This variety is often used in container gardens or as a bedding plant due to its vibrant leaf colors and ease of care."
