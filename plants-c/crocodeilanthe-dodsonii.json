    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe dodsonii, commonly known as the dragon's tongue fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often spiky fronds that resemble a dragon's tongue. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its intricate frond structure and unusual appearance make it a subject of interest for botanists and plant enthusiasts alike. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
