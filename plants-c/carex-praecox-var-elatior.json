    "intro": "Carex praecox var. elatior, commonly known as the tall sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, rushes, and similar plants. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshy or swampy areas, and is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, consist of small, greenish-brown flowers that are wind-pollinated. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
