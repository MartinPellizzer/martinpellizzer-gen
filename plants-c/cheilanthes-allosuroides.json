    "intro": "Cheilanthes allosuroides, commonly known as the broad-leaf rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its robust, thick rhizomes and large, leathery, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It typically grows on rocky outcrops and in crevices, where it can retain moisture. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in challenging habitats."
