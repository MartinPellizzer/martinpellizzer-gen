    "intro": "Cyphia triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaved cyphia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, waxy leaves that are often clustered in threes, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically tubular and come in shades of yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Cyphia triphylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
