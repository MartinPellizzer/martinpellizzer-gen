It features small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, linear leaves and a compact growth habit, often forming dense mats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky habitats. This variety is less showy than other campanula species but is valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators."
