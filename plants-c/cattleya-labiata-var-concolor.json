    "intro": "Cattleya labiata var. concolor, commonly known as the pink-tinged cattleya, is a hybrid orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range from white to pink, often with a subtle lip that adds to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences, and its leaves are broad and elliptical, arranged in a compact rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is highly valued in horticulture for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
