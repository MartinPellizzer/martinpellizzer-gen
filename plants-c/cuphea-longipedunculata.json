It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red flowers that resemble tiny torches. The plant has hairy, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its inflorescence consists of long, slender peduncles bearing clusters of showy, two-lipped flowers. Cuphea longipedunculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower due to its long-lasting blooms."
