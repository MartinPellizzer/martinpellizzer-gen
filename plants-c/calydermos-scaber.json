    "intro": "Calydermos scaber, commonly known as the rough-skin calyderm, is a rare and lesser-known plant species with unique botanical characteristics. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a robust, woody stem covered in a dense layer of rough, scaly bark, which gives it its scientific name. Its leaves are ovate, with a leathery texture and a slightly serrated margin, while its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and often have a pale greenish hue. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Calydermos scaber is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
