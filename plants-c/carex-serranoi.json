    "intro": "Carex serranoi, commonly known as the serrated sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to parts of eastern North America, particularly in moist to wet habitats such as swamps and marshes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. Carex serranoi is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability."
