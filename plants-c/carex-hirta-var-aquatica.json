    "intro": "Carex hirta var. aquatica, commonly known as the aquatic sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, exhibiting a robust rhizomatous root system that aids in stabilizing aquatic habitats. The plant produces dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, short hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-stamened flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. This species plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
