It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and small, leathery leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its most notable feature is the secretion of a resinous gum, which has been used traditionally for medicinal and aromatic purposes.
