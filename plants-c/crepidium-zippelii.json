    "intro": "Crepidium zippelii, commonly known as the Zippel's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a slender stem and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in small inflorescences. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
