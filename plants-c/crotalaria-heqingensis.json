    "intro": "Crotalaria heqingensis, commonly known as the Heqing false flax, is a flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and can be dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution. Crotalaria heqingensis is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, although further research is needed to confirm its applications."
