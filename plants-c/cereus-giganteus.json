    "intro": "Cereus giganteus, commonly known as the giant night bloomer, is a cactus native to the Caribbean and southern United States. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 15 feet in height. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night and remain open for only one night. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It is often cultivated for its striking appearance and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
