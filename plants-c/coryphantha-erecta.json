    "intro": "Coryphantha erecta, commonly known as the erect coryphantha, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless plant with rounded, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by red, berry-like fruits. Coryphantha erecta thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
