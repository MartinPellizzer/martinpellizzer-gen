It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Cerastium melanandrum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
