    "intro": "Coleosanthus veronicifolius var. senilis, commonly known as the silver fern, is a striking plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery fronds that resemble a fern, though it is not a true fern but a member of the Cyatheaceae family. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk with a fibrous, spongy covering that gives it a unique appearance. Its leaves are long, narrow, and have a silvery-blue hue due to the presence of tiny, overlapping scales. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is considered a symbol of New Zealand's natural heritage."
