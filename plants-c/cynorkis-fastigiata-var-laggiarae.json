    "intro": "Cynorkis fastigiata var. laggiarae, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of water bodies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green and arranged in a dense, upright cluster. Its small, inconspicuous flowers appear in early spring and are clustered in spikelets. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments."
