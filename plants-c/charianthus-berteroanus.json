    "intro": "Charianthus berteroanus, commonly known as the Andean sunflower, is a herbaceous plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets and compact, bushy growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations between 3,000 and 5,000 meters. It produces small, tubular disk flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its unique habitat and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
