    "intro": "Cyclosorus abortivus, commonly known as the abortive cyclosorus, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow in dense clusters on rocky or shaded forest floors. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces sporangia in clusters along the margins of its leaves. Due to its restricted habitat and low reproductive success, it is considered endangered and faces significant threats from habitat destruction. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and role in the ecosystems it inhabits."
