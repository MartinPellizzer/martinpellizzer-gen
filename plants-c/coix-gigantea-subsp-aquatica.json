    "intro": "Coix gigantea subsp. aquatica, commonly known as giant water bamboo, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant features long, narrow leaves that float on the water surface, with rhizomes that spread beneath the sediment. Its cylindrical stems are often hollow and can grow up to several meters in length. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by three-lobed, spiky fruits that are adapted for water dispersal."
