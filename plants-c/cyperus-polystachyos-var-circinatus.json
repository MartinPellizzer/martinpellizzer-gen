    "intro": "Cyperus polystachyos var. circinatus, commonly known as the curly flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curled at the tips, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically inconspicuous and borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist or aquatic habitats, such as marshes and pond edges, and is often found in disturbed wetlands. Its botanical structure is adapted to waterlogged conditions, with rhizomes that help it spread and establish in suitable environments."
