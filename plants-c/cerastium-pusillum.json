    "intro": "Cerastium pusillum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features small, prostrate stems covered in dense, silky white hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, and it produces small, round berries that contain the seeds. Cerastium pusillum is often used in gardens as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and ability to spread readily."
