    "intro": "Cereus polymorphus, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its short, thick stem and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a unique appearance due to its bright, colorful \"crown\" which is actually a grafted variety of a different cactus species. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Its botanical name reflects its variable growth forms, making it a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts."
