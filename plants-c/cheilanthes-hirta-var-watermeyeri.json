    "intro": "Cheilanthes hirta var. watermeyeri, commonly known as the hairy rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and hairy, leathery fronds that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found on limestone or sandstone outcrops. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
