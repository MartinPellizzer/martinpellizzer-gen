    "intro": "Carex vitilis, commonly known as the white-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces viable seeds that contribute to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems. Carex vitilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings due to its distinctive appearance."
