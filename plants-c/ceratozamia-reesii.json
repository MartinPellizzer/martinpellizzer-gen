    "intro": "Ceratozamia reesii, commonly known as the Rees's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the cycad family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones appearing first and the female cones developing later in the growing season. Ceratozamia reesii is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
