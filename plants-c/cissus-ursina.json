    "intro": "Cissus ursina, commonly known as the climbing oxalis, is a vigorous, trailing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves with prominent veins, and its stems are covered in tiny, hooked tendrils that aid in climbing. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage. Cissus ursina is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
