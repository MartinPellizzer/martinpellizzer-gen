    "intro": "Cyperus zairensis, commonly known as the Zaire flatsedge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. Cyperus zairensis produces small, clustered flower heads that are often inconspicuous, typical of many sedges. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and can sometimes be found in disturbed or aquatic habitats."
