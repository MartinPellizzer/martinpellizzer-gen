    "intro": "Cystopteris utahensis, commonly known as the Utah water fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that resemble those of a water fern, though it typically grows in moist, shaded environments rather than water. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of hair. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the family Polypodiaceae. Cystopteris utahensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms in its native range."
