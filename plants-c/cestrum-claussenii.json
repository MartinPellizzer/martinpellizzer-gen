    "intro": "Cestrum claussenii, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun exposure. Cestrum claussenii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique flowering habit."
