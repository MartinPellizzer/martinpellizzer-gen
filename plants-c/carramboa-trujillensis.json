    "intro": "Carramboa trujillensis, commonly known as the Trujillense Carramboa, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of Peru. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its striking, violet-blue petals and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
