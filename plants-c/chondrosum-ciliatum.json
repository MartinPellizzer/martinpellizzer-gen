    "intro": "Chondrosum ciliatum, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a dense mat of silver-gray, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its succulent leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that provide additional protection against intense sunlight and drought. Chondrosum ciliatum is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities."
