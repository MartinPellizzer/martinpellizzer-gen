    "intro": "Carex glauca f. serrulata, commonly known as blue-green sedge, is a variant of the blue-green sedge species native to North America. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its striking color and ability to tolerate wet conditions make it a popular choice for water garden and bog plantings."
