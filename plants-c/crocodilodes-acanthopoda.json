    "intro": "Crocodilodes acanthopoda, commonly known as the spiny scale plant, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, followed by tiny, spherical fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Crocodilodes acanthopoda is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
