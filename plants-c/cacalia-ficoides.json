    "intro": "Cacalia ficoides, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for coastal and arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Cacalia ficoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low-maintenance once established."
