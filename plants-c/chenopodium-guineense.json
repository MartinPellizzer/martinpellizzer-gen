    "intro": "Chenopodium guineense, commonly known as African goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is an annual herb that typically grows in moist soils and can be found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Chenopodium guineense is also known for its potential medicinal uses in traditional African medicine."
