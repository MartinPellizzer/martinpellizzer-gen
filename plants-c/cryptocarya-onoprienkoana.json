    "intro": "Cryptocarya onoprienkoana, commonly known as the Onoprienko's cryptocarya, is a species of flowering plant in the Lauraceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are small, woody drupes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
