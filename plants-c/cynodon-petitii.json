It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and resilient. Cynodon petitii is often used in ornamental landscaping and as a forage crop for livestock."
