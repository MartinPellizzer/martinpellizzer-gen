    "intro": "Claoxylon monoicum, commonly known as the single-seeded claoxylon, is a rare and unique plant species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its woody structure and produces a single, large seed within a fleshy, orange-colored fruit. The plant has a slow growth rate and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a smooth, glossy surface. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, Claoxylon monoicum is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
