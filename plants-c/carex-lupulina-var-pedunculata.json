    "intro": "Carex lupulina var. pedunculata, commonly known as the purple-fruited sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces distinctive purple or brown spikelets that mature into small, three-lobed berries. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
