It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Camphoromoea zizyphoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
