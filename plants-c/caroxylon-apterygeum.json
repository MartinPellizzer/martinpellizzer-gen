    "intro": "Caroxylon apterygeum, commonly known as the desert shrub or desert sage, is a low-growing, woody plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots allow it to anchor firmly in sandy or rocky soils. Caroxylon apterygeum is well adapted to survive in extreme conditions with minimal water availability."
