    "intro": "Clitoria grandifolia, commonly known as the winged bean or butterfly pea, is a tropical leguminous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive violet-blue, winged petals that resemble butterfly wings, and it produces small, edible beans inside its pod-like fruit. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for its nutritious seeds, which are rich in protein. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is typically grown in well-drained soil. Clitoria grandifolia also has medicinal uses in traditional medicine, particularly for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
