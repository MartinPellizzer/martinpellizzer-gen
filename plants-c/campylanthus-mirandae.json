    "intro": "Campylanthus mirandae, commonly known as the Miranda's curlleaf, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, curling leaves and vibrant blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. It has a low-growing habit with a compact, mat-like form, and its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Campylanthus mirandae is considered a rare and endangered species."
