    "intro": "Christopteris cantoniensis, commonly known as the Chinese button fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and small, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in circular structures known as sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Christopteris cantoniensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
