    "intro": "Cardamine raphanifolia f. lactea, commonly known as the milky watercress, is a rare and delicate fern-like plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a milky sap. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small white flowers appear in early spring, and it is noted for its unique, slightly toxic milky secretion. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
