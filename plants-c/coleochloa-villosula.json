It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typical of many legumes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
