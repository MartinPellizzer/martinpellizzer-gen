It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and fleshy, ribbed leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated by succulent enthusiasts."
