It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a slightly hairy surface. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds."
