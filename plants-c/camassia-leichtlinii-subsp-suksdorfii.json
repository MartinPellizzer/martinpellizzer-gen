    "intro": "Camassia leichtlinii subsp. suksdorfii, commonly known as the Saksdorf's camas, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or open meadow habitats. Its leaves are basal, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating, while its stems are usually unbranched. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance as a food source for pollinators and its role in native plant restoration projects."
