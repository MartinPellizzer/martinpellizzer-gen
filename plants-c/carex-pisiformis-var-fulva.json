    "intro": "Carex pisiformis var. fulva, commonly known as the yellow sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms clumps and produces small, yellowish-brown flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and pond edges, and prefers full to partial sun. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a glossy appearance, while the inflorescence consists of a single, cylindrical spike. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
