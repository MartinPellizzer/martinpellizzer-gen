    "intro": "Carex nigra subsp. nigra, commonly known as black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dark green, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has a robust rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Black sedge is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in wetland environments."
