    "intro": "Carduus gayanus, commonly known as the Galician thistle, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flower heads, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Its leaves are usually covered in a layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late summer and early autumn, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
