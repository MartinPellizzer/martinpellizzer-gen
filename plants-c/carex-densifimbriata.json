    "intro": "Carex densifimbriata, commonly known as the dense-fringed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of East Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
