    "intro": "Cerastium pindigenum, commonly known as the rock chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its rocky habitat. Cerastium pindigenum is often found in dry, sunny slopes and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
