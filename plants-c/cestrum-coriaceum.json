    "intro": "Cestrum coriaceum, commonly known as the leatherleaf cestrum, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in the evening. These flowers are adapted for pollination by moths, as they emit a strong scent at night. The plant is also known for its ornamental value and is cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and nocturnal blooms."
