    "intro": "Cicerbita villosa, commonly known as the hairy bittercress, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, hairy stems and small, kidney-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several small, oblong seeds. Cicerbita villosa is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in gardens, where it can become a weed."
