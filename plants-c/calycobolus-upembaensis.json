    "intro": "Calycobolus upembaensis, commonly known as the Upemba bulbous plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It features a rosette of fleshy, thickened leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid or seasonally dry habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a terminal spike, typical of the Amaryllidaceae family. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive periods of drought. Calycobolus upembaensis is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and flowering habit."
