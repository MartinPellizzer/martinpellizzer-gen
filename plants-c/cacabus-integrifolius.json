    "intro": "Cacabus integrifolius, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and red or orange berries. The plant can grow as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters in favorable conditions. Its leaves are typically entire, hence the species name *integrifolius*, and it produces showy flowers that attract pollinators. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
