    "intro": "Cleome angulata, commonly known as angular cleome, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an annual herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring slender, angular stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge, while its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. Cleome angulata is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
