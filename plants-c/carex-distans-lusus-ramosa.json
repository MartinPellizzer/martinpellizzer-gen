It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has rhizomes that help it spread and establish colonies in suitable habitats. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with separate male and female parts, typical of many sedges."
