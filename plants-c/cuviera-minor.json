    "intro": "Cuviera minor, commonly known as the lesser cuviera, is a small flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and white or pale green, arranged in umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
