    "intro": "Caesalpinia horrida, commonly known as the horrid ticktree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with stiff, bristle-like hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in dense, spiky clusters, which are often visited by bees and birds. Its fruit is a woody pod that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Caesalpinia horrida is adapted to dry and disturbed habitats, making it a resilient species in its native environment."
