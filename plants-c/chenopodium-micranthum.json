    "intro": "Chenopodium micranthum, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in tiny, three-angled capsules, which are dispersed by wind. Chenopodium micranthum is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions."
