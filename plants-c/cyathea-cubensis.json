    "intro": "Cyathea cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban tree fern, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant is a spore-bearing fern, reproducing through the release of spores rather than seeds. Its rhizome system allows it to anchor firmly in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. The fronds can grow up to several meters in length, contributing to its striking visual appearance in its natural habitat."
