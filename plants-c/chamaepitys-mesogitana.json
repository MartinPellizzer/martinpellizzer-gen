It belongs to the Pinaceae family and is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in high-altitude forests. The Greek fir is valued for its timber and plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
