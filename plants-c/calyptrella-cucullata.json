    "intro": "Calyptrella cucullata, commonly known as the hooded bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually whorled and short, with the bladders attached to the stems. Calyptrella cucullata is primarily found in temperate regions and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling small invertebrate populations."
