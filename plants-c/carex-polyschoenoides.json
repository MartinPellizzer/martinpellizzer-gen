    "intro": "Carex polyschoenoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and pond edges, and thrives in full to partial sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers in the summer. Carex polyschoenoides is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
