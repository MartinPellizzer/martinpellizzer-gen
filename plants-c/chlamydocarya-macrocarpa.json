    "intro": "Chlamydocarya macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant sequoia, is a towering coniferous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its massive size, with some specimens reaching heights of over 300 feet and diameters exceeding 10 feet. The tree has scale-like leaves arranged in flat sprays, and its cones are woody and contain two-winged seeds. It is adapted to thrive in moist, temperate climates with well-drained soils. The bark is thick and fibrous, providing protection against fire and insect damage."
