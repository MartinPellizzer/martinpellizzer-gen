    "intro": "Cheilanthes peninsularis var. insularis, commonly known as the insular rock fern, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of the Mediterranean, particularly the Balearic Islands. It is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in rocky, coastal environments, often growing on limestone substrates. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a pale green to grayish hue, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate saline and arid conditions, making it well adapted to its coastal habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
