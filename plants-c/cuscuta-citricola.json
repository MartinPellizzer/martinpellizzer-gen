    "intro": "Cuscuta citricola, commonly known as citrus dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nourishment. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that begins with seed germination, followed by attachment to a host via specialized haustoria. The plant is often found parasitizing members of the Rutaceae family, including citrus trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread to new hosts. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken or even kill its host plants."
