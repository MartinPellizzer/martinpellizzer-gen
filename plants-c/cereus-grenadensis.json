    "intro": "Cereus grenadensis, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. These flowers typically bloom only once a year, making the plant a rare and striking sight. Cereus grenadensis is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
