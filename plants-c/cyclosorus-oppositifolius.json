    "intro": "Cyclosorus oppositifolius, commonly known as the opposite-leaved water flea, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the order Hydrocharitales. It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of narrow, linear leaves that arise from a horizontal rhizome. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its tiny, inconspicuous flowers are usually submerged, and it reproduces both sexually and asexually through rhizome growth. Cyclosorus oppositifolius plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
