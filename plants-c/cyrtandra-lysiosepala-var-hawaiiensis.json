    "intro": "Cyrtandra lysiosepala var. hawaiiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky areas. It has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and is often found in montane and coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Hawaii."
