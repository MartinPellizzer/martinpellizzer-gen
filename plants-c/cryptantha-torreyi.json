    "intro": "Cryptantha torreyi, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss, and its stems are often branched and upright. Cryptantha torreyi plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and provides nectar for pollinators."
