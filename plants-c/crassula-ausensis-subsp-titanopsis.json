It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge under direct sunlight. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor plant collections."
