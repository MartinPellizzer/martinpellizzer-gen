    "intro": "Cerastium arvense var. nervosum, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are hairy and often have distinct veins, giving it its varietal name \"nervosum.\" The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a useful plant for ground cover in gardens."
