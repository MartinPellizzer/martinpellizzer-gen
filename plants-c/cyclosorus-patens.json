    "intro": "Cyclosorus patens, commonly known as the spreading cyclosorus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread horizontally across the substrate. Its leaves are long, ribbon-like, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
