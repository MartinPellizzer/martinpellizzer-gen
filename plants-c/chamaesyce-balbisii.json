It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its succulent, prostrate growth habit. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with five petals and are borne in clusters near the base of the stems. Chamaesyce balbisii is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun and drought conditions."
