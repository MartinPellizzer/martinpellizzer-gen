    "intro": "Crepis vesicaria subsp. vesicaria, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, basal rosette of leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. It has a taproot system and produces achenes that are dispersed by wind. Its name derives from the inflated, bladder-like structure at the base of its flower heads."
