    "intro": "Cassia ornata, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of bright yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into multiple pairs of small leaflets. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain flat, seed-filled structures. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
