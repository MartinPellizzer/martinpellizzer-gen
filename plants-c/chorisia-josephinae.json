    "intro": "Chorisia josephinae, commonly known as the Josephina's fan-petioled tree, is a distinctive plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that resemble a fan, with long petioles that allow the leaves to droop gracefully. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a vibrant touch to its appearance. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight. Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists."
