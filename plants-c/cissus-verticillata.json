It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental and medicinal use. Due to its adaptability, it is often used in xeriscaping and traditional herbal medicine."
