    "intro": "Clavija cauliflora, commonly known as the tree of life, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique cauliflorous growth habit, where flowers and fruits develop directly on the trunk and branches. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, round berries with a sweet and tart flavor. Its leaves are broad, glossy, and often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Clavija cauliflora is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
