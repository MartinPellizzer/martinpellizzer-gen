It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its distinct morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
