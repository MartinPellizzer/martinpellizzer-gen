    "intro": "Cuscuta oxypetala, commonly known as the silky dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or yellow in color. The plant's stems are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it its common name. It is found in various regions of the Americas and can parasitize a wide range of host plants, including crops and wild vegetation. Its life cycle involves attaching to host plants via haustoria, which penetrate the host's tissues to extract water and nutrients."
