    "intro": "Croton cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-leaf croton, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, ash-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its unique foliage and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural use in warm climates."
