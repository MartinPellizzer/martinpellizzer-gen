    "intro": "Cyrtopodium parkinsonii, commonly known as the Parkinson's coryphoe, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps in capturing moisture from the air. Cyrtopodium parkinsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in warm, humid conditions."
