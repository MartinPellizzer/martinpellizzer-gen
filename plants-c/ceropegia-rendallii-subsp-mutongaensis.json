It is a succulent species with fleshy, tuberous roots and slender, branching stems. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate sunlight, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
