    "intro": "Carduus litigiosus subsp. horridissimus, commonly known as the horrid prickly thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and a tall, flowering stem that produces purple to pinkish composite flowers. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. Its robust structure and defensive spines help it survive in harsh conditions. It is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
