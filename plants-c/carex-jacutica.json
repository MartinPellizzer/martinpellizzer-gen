    "intro": "Carex jacutica, commonly known as the jacutica sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, meadows, and along riverbanks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces three-sided, three-rowed seeds. Carex jacutica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
