    "intro": "Casearia carpinifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf casearia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a silvery or whitish pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange to red berries. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Casearia carpinifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
