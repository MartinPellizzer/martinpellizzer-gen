    "intro": "Cistus vulgaris var. villosus, commonly known as the woolly rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. The species is also known for its aromatic resin, which has been used historically in perfumery and traditional medicine."
