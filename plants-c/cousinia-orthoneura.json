    "intro": "Cousinia orthoneura, commonly known as the narrowleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cousinia orthoneura produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
