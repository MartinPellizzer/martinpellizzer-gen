    "intro": "Crocus vernus subsp. nivigena, commonly known as the snow crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The flowers bloom early in the spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, making it one of the first flowers to appear in the landscape. Its bulbs are adapted to survive harsh winter conditions, and it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. This subspecies is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and early bloom."
