It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are typically pollinated by insects, followed by the development of small, round fruits. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest in botanical research. The species is also valued for its potential ecological roles in its native habitats."
