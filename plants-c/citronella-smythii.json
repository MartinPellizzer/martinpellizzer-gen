It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, erect growth and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It is often cultivated for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent. Its essential oils contain high concentrations of citronellol, which contributes to its distinctive scent and repellent effects."
