    "intro": "Cyperus maritimus var. subtilis, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a flowering plant native to coastal and brackish wetlands. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, thriving in saline environments. Its slender, grass-like leaves are often arranged in a fan-like pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. This variant is distinguished by its finer leaves and more compact growth compared to other Cyperus species."
