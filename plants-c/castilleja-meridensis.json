    "intro": "Castilleja meridensis, commonly known as the southern milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound and often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Castilleja meridensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain wildlife."
