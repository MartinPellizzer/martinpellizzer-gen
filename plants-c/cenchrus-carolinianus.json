    "intro": "Cenchrus carolinianus, commonly known as the Carolinian grass or panicum carolinianum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, seed-bearing spikes that are often visible during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in wetland environments. Cenchrus carolinianus is also known for its ability to tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
