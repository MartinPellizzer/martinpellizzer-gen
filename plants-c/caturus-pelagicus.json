    "intro": "Caturus pelagicus, commonly known as the ocean lily, is a unique marine plant that thrives in deep-sea environments. It possesses delicate, fan-like structures that resemble flowers, which help it capture nutrients from the water. The plant lacks true roots, instead anchoring itself to the seafloor with specialized holdfasts. Its reproductive system relies on microscopic spores dispersed by ocean currents. Due to its deep-sea habitat, it is rarely observed and remains a subject of ongoing botanical research."
