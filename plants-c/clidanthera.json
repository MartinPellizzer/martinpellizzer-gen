    "intro": "Clidanthera, commonly known as the spider flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often colorful bracts that resemble spider-like structures, which are actually modified leaves. Clidanthera species typically have opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by the striking bracts. The genus is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in warm, humid climates."
