    "intro": "Cereus hassleri, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and the ability to produce large, showy white flowers at night. The plant is adapted to extreme desert conditions, with thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration. Its flowers, which open only during the night, are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths. Cereus hassleri is a striking example of xerophytic adaptation in the plant kingdom."
