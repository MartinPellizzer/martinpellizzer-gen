    "intro": "Cystopteris rhaetica, commonly known as the Rhaetic water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often found in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizome that is submerged, with leaves that are typically pinnately divided and have a soft, feathery appearance. It thrives in temperate regions and is often found in slow-moving streams or ponds. The reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
