It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many toxic and ornamental plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Its leaves are typically opposite and oval-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value, though it should be handled with care due to its potentially toxic properties."
