    "intro": "Cyrtostemma maritimum, commonly known as the sea onion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its strap-like, grass-like leaves and clustered, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, adapting to saline and wind-swept environments. Its bulbs are often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal. Cyrtostemma maritimum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
