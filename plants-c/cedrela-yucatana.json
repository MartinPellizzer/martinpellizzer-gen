It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its straight, durable wood that is highly valued for construction and furniture. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly rough texture. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Cedrela yucatana is often found in lowland tropical forests and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils."
