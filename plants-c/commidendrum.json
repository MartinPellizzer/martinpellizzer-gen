    "intro": "Commidendrum, commonly known as the elephant's ear, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aroidae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in areas with high humidity and warm climates. They are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to several feet in diameter. The flowers are typically small and clustered in spadices, which are modified leaf-like structures. Commidendrum species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their striking foliage and unique appearance."
