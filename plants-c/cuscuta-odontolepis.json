    "intro": "Cuscuta odontolepis, commonly known as the toothed dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid growth habit, often forming dense mats on its host. The plant's stems are pale and thread-like, with a tendency to twine around the stems of its host. It is native to various regions in the Americas and is commonly found on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host, sometimes leading to reduced growth or even death."
