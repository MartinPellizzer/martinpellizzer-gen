    "intro": "Chamaefistula berlandieri, commonly known as the Mexican ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and consist of several ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
