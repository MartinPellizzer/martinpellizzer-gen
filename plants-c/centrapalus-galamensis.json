It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus plants. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species."
