    "intro": "Citrus daoxianensis, commonly known as the Daxian citrus or Daxian lemon, is a rare and lesser-known citrus species native to China. It is characterized by its small, round fruits with a thick, aromatic rind and a tangy, acidic pulp. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, featuring glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers. It is adapted to subtropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and unique flavor profile, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
