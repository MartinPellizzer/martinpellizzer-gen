It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and distinctive blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in coastal environments and well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy areas. Its leaves are typically broad and oval, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.
