    "intro": "Cnesmocarpon dentata, commonly known as the serrated bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches, where it can float or root in the substrate. Its leaves are often divided and have serrated edges, contributing to its common name. Cnesmocarpon dentata is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
