    "intro": "Chlorophytum bracteatum, commonly known as the snake plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with distinct yellow or white markings. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires minimal water, making it an ideal houseplant. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water, which helps it survive in arid environments. Chlorophytum bracteatum is also noted for its air-purifying qualities, as it can remove toxins from the air."
