It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish in color. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a rough texture, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
