    "intro": "Cerastium banaticum subsp. kosaninii, commonly known as the Kosanin's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southeastern Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and dense, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grassy areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
