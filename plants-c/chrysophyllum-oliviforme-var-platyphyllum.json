    "intro": "Chrysophyllum oliviforme var. platyphyllum, commonly known as the African cherry or *Pentaclethra macrophylla*, is a tropical evergreen tree native to western Africa. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy texture. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, orange-red fruits resembling small cherries. Its bark is thick and corky, and it has a long history of use in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
