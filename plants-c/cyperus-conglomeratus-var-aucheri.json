It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
