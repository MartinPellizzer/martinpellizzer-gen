    "intro": "Clytostoma noterophilum, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its pale green to white stems and its unique, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has small, strap-shaped leaves and produces showy, white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, intricate pattern. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to survive. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is critically endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws."
