    "intro": "Caladenia insularis, commonly known as the Island Spider-orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the island of Tasmania. It typically grows in heathland and dry sclerophyll forests, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features a single, slender stem that bears a single, showy, spider-like flower with a distinctive labellum. Its flowering period occurs during the spring, and it is known for its pale pink to cream-colored petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
