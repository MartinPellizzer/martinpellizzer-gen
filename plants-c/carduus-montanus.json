    "intro": "Carduus montanus, commonly known as the mountain thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky, or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features spiny leaves and a tall, branched stem that bears purple to pink flowers. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Carduus montanus is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and digestive properties."
