    "intro": "Cypripedium fairrieanum, commonly known as the Fairrie's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a single, upright stem that bears a single flower, and its leaves are broad and lance-shaped. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and beauty, it is highly valued in both horticulture and conservation efforts."
