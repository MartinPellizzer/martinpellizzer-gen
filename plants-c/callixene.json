It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves that are hairy and soft to the touch. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by long, slender pods containing edible, kidney-shaped seeds. Callixene thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of protein-rich seeds. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and agricultural use."
