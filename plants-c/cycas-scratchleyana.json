    "intro": "Cycas scratchleyana, commonly known as the Northern Territory cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It is native to northern Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Queensland, and thrives in sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
