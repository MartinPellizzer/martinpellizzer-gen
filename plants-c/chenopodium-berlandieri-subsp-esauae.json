    "intro": "Chenopodium berlandieri subsp. esauae, commonly known as buffalo bur, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its prickly, spherical seed heads that resemble small burs, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and along roadsides. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are erect and branched. The species is adapted to arid environments and is considered an important component of native plant communities in the Great Plains."
