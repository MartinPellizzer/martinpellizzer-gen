    "intro": "Carpinus compressus, commonly known as the European hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, smooth, gray bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its hard wood has been historically used for tool handles and furniture."
