    "intro": "Cactus lanceolatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are typically green and covered in small, backward-pointing spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a feature typical of desert plants that helps reduce water loss. Cactus lanceolatus is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
