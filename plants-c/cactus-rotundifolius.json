    "intro": "Cactus rotundifolius, commonly known as the globe cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical shape and thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. Cactus rotundifolius is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
