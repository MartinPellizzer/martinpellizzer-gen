    "intro": "Carex rahmeri, commonly known as the Rahmer's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like flower clusters. Native to North America, particularly the southeastern United States, it thrives in wet or moist environments such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland habitats."
