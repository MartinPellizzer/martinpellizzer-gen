    "intro": "Cyperus crassipes, commonly known as nut sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its triangular, tuberous rhizomes and erect, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, three-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes, swamps, and pond edges, where it thrives in saturated soils. Its leaves are alternate, stiff, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Cyperus crassipes is an invasive species in many regions, often outcompeting native vegetation and altering wetland ecosystems."
