    "intro": "Cyanea knudsenii var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth Cyanea, is a rare Hawaiian plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, which are typically dark green and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads. It is endemic to the island of Hawaii and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
