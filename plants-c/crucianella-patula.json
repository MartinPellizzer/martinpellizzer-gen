    "intro": "Crucianella patula, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. This plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowers are small and usually yellow or greenish in color. Crucianella patula plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web and providing habitat for microorganisms."
