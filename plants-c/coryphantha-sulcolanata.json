    "intro": "Coryphantha sulcolanata, commonly known as the zigzag cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and often have a zigzag appearance due to the presence of tubercles. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the axils of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
