    "intro": "Corispermum ucrainicum, commonly known as the Ukrainian corispermum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Chenopodiaceae. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in disturbed soils. The plant produces small, greenish flowers and has a compact, bushy growth habit. Its seeds are encased in a hard, dry fruit known as a capsule, which aids in dispersal by wind. Corispermum ucrainicum is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
