It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant is often found growing in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Cyrtandra vaupelii has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
