    "intro": "Cedrus libani subsp. deodora, commonly known as the Deodar cedar, is a subspecies of the Lebanon cedar native to the Himalayas and parts of western China. It is a large, evergreen conifer with a distinctive, weeping habit and needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in clusters. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is valued for its aromatic wood and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appearance. This subspecies is also notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resilience to cold climates."
