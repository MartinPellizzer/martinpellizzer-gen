    "intro": "Cuscuta verrucosa, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It has slender, yellowish stems that twine around its host, forming a dense network of connections. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its seeds are covered in a sticky substance that aids in attachment to the host plant. Cuscuta verrucosa is often found in agricultural fields and disturbed habitats, where it can cause significant damage to crops."
