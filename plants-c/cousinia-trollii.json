    "intro": "Cousinia trollii, commonly known as the Tibetan cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible roots. The plant is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern and are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Cousinia trollii is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species found in alpine and rocky habitats."
