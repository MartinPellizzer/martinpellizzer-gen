It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by blue-black berries that are highly ornamental. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Due to its attractive foliage and fruit, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value."
