    "intro": "Cerbera dilatata, commonly known as the Madagascar almond or the poison apple, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, orange-red fruits that resemble apples, which contain toxic seeds. Its botanical features include a milky sap that can cause skin irritation, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, due to its toxic properties, it requires careful handling and is not recommended for use in gardens with children or pets."
