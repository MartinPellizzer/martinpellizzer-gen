    "intro": "Capparis pluvialis, commonly known as the rainflower or coastal caper, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and limestone soils, thriving in saline and well-drained conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with a distinctive, pungent odor, which attracts pollinators such as bees and wasps. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water."
