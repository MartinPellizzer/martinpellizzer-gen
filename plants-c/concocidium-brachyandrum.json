    "intro": "Concocidium brachyandrum, commonly known as the dwarf starflower, is a small, flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically produces small, white or pale pink blooms that appear in clusters during the warmer months. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
