    "intro": "Colchicum figlalii, commonly known as the Armenian colchic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It belongs to the family Colchicaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces a bulbous corm, which serves as its primary storage organ and allows it to survive harsh environmental conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from the base of the plant. Colchicum figlalii is notable for containing colchicine, a toxic alkaloid used in medical treatments."
