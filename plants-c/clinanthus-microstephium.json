    "intro": "Clinanthus microstephium, commonly known as the small-stephania, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Clinanthus microstephium is considered a rare and endangered species."
