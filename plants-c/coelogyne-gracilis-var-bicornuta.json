    "intro": "Coelogyne gracilis var. bicornuta, commonly known as the two-horned orchid, is a striking terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features elongated, strap-like leaves and produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant is characterized by its distinctive two-horned shape on the lip of its flowers, which gives it its common name. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
