It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in prairies, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a dense, compact growth pattern that helps it thrive in competitive environments. The inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, three-ranked flowers, typical of the sedge family."
