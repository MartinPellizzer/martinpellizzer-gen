    "intro": "Chamaemespilus pseudaria, commonly known as the false elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Betulaceae and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in shaded areas."
