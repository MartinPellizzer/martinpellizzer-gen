    "intro": "Carduus glaucus, commonly known as the glaucous thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its grayish-blue foliage and spiny, purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its leaves are covered in a powdery waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
