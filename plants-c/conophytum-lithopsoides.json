    "intro": "Conophytum lithopsoides, commonly known as the \"living stone,\" is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that resemble stones, helping it blend into its arid environment. The plant stores water in its leaves, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Conophytum lithopsoides is well adapted to rocky, sun-exposed habitats and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
