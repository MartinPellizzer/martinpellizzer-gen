It features showy, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
