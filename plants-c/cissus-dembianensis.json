    "intro": "Cissus dembianensis, commonly known as the African stone plant, is a climbing plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy texture, while its stems are often used in traditional medicine. Cissus dembianensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to climb structures in gardens."
