    "intro": "Convolvulus hypocrateriformis, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that open in the morning and close in the afternoon. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscaped gardens."
