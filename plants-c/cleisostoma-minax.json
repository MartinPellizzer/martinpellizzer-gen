    "intro": "Cleisostoma minax, commonly known as the golden cleistostoma, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically features broad, ovate leaves with a waxy texture and a pleasant, sweet fragrance. Cleisostoma minax thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of tropical flora."
