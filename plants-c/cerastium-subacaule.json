    "intro": "Cerastium subacaule, commonly known as the prostrate mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, oval-shaped seed pods. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks. Cerastium subacaule is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
