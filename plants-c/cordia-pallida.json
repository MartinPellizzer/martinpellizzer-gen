It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and small, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by spherical, yellowish fruits.

It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
