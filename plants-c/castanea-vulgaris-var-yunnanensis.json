    "intro": "Castanea vulgaris var. yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan chestnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and other chestnut species. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, similar to other chestnut species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and serrated, turning yellow in the autumn before dropping."
