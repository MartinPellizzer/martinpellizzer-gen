    "intro": "Cakile maritima subsp. aegyptica, commonly known as the Egyptian sea\u706b\u7bad, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in coastal areas, particularly in the Mediterranean and parts of Africa. It has a low-growing habit and produces small, round fruits that disperse via the wind. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
