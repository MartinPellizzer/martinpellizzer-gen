It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers with spurred petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
