    "intro": "Ceratocephala incurva, commonly known as the narrow-leafed spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its latex is milky and can be toxic, a common feature among plants in the Euphorbiaceae family. Ceratocephala incurva thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides."
