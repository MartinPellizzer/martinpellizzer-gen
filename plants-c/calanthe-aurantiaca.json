    "intro": "Calanthe aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and a dense, spike-like inflorescence that bears clusters of showy, orange-red flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Calanthe aurantiaca is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
