It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features a creeping rhizome with erect, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, which are released into the air for dispersal. Campyloneurum vexatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
