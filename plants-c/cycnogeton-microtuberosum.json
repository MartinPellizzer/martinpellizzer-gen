    "intro": "Cycnogeton microtuberosum, commonly known as the small tuber cycnogeton, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andean region of South America. It features a compact growth habit with slender stems and small, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom during the warmer months. Its most distinctive characteristic is the presence of numerous small, tuberous roots that serve as storage organs. Cycnogeton microtuberosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
