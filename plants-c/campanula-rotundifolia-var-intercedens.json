    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia var. intercedens, commonly known as the round-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are rounded and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. This variety is often found in rocky soils and open meadows, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, attractive plant for shady or moist environments."
