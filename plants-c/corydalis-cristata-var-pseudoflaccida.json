    "intro": "Corydalis cristata var. pseudoflaccida, commonly known as the crested lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is a member of the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, crested flower heads that resemble a crown. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
