    "intro": "Cleome pungens var. swartziana, commonly known as the swamp cleome, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its stems are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens."
