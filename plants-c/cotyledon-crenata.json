    "intro": "Cotyledon crenata, commonly known as the crinkled cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it store water. The leaves are often crinkled or ruffled, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal watering to thrive."
