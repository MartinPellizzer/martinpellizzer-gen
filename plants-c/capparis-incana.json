    "intro": "Capparis incana, commonly known as the hairless caper, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically yellow or orange when mature. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, though the species name \"incana\" refers to its tendency to lose these hairs as it matures. Capparis incana is often found in rocky or coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
