    "intro": "Cerastium rectum, commonly known as the upright chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves that are usually hairy and covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of streams. Cerastium rectum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
