    "intro": "Chenopodium incisum, commonly known as wild spinach or lambsquarters, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often lobed or toothed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as fields and roadsides. Chenopodium incisum is edible, with young leaves that can be cooked and consumed like spinach."
