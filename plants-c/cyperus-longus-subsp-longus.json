    "intro": "Cyperus longus subsp. longus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along waterways. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
