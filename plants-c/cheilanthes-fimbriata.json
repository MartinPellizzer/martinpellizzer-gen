    "intro": "Cheilanthes fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with finely serrated margins. The plant typically grows on limestone or shale, thriving in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Cheilanthes fimbriata is often found in crevices and on rock faces, where it forms dense, low-growing colonies."
