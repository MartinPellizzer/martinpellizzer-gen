    "intro": "Colymbada cephalariifolia, commonly known as the head-leaf water clover, is a rare aquatic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a unique and intricate appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in shallow, nutrient-rich waters. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value to its aquatic habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
