    "intro": "Cyrtandra barnesii, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 Cyrtandra, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforest understories. Cyrtandra barnesii is known for its small, elliptical leaves and is often found in association with other endemic Hawaiian flora. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
