    "intro": "Centaurea pallescens var. hyalolepis, commonly known as the pale centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is closely related to other centaurea species, sharing similar growth habits and floral structures. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
