    "intro": "Celsia suworowiana var. papillosum, commonly known as the papillate celsia, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spiny stems and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant exhibits a peculiar feature of having papillae\u2014small, nipple-like projections\u2014on its stems, which are believed to aid in water retention. Its flowers, typically red or orange, bloom in late summer and attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
