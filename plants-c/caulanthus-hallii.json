It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray leaves and tall, branched stems that bear small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. It plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
