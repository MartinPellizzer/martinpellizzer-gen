    "intro": "Cistus albidus f. typicus, commonly known as the white rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and coastal environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, glandular hairs that help reduce water loss, a feature typical of many Mediterranean plants. The species is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
