    "intro": "Commarum, commonly known as sweetflag, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It consists of several species, most notably Commarum palustre, which is native to wetland habitats in North America and Asia. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, sword-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically green or white. It thrives in moist or aquatic environments, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its medicinal properties, some species of Commarum have been used in traditional herbal remedies."
