    "intro": "Cedrela serrata var. puberula, commonly known as the Brazilian cedar or yellow cedar, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale to golden-brown bark and lance-shaped, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for furniture and construction, though it is now threatened by overharvesting."
