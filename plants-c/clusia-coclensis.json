    "intro": "Clusia coclensis, commonly known as the Caribbean beauty or broadleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Clusia coclensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its ability to thrive in shaded environments and its tolerance to urban conditions. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
