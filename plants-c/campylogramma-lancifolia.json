It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
