It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain small, black seeds. It is often used in traditional medicine and for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Cassia delagoensis thrives in dry, tropical, and subtropical climates."
