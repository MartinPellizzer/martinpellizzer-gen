    "intro": "Caladium rubescens, commonly known as the red-veined caladium, is a tropical perennial plant native to South America. It is prized for its striking, heart-shaped leaves that display vivid red veins against a pale green or white background. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often grown as an ornamental plant in gardens and containers due to its vibrant foliage. Caladium rubescens typically blooms with small, inconspicuous white flowers, though these are rarely seen in cultivation."
