    "intro": "Corylus chinensis var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 leaflets, and its catkin-like male flowers. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which mature in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential as a food source for wildlife."
