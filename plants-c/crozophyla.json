    "intro": "Crozophyla, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, spiky, and often blue or purple flowers that resemble holly berries. They are typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in saline environments. Crozophyla species are herbaceous perennials that can grow up to several feet tall, with lance-shaped leaves. Their unique appearance and ecological adaptations make them an important part of coastal ecosystems."
