    "intro": "Clematis laxipaniculata, commonly known as the broad-leaved clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with ovate to lanceolate leaflets and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are twining and can grow up to 15 feet in length, making it suitable for trellises or as a backdrop plant. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds when mature."
