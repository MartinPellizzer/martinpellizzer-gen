    "intro": "Cerasus verrucosa, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or Prunus serrulata, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by red or black berries. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic value and is also used in traditional medicine. Cerasus verrucosa prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
