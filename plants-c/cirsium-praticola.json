    "intro": "Cirsium praticola, commonly known as the field thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny leaves. The plant typically grows in dry meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped with rough, prickly textures, and its purple flowers bloom in late summer. Cirsium praticola plays a role in supporting pollinators and is often found in ecological restoration projects."
