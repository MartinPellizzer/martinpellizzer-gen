    "intro": "Colletia trifurcata, commonly known as the three-branched candelabra cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is a succulent plant characterized by its branching, cylindrical stems that resemble a candelabra. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often followed by small, red fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in arid environments. Colletia trifurcata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
