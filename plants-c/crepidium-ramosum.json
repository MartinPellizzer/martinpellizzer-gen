    "intro": "Crepidium ramosum, commonly known as the ramose orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a dense spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy areas along the Atlantic coast. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
