    "intro": "Crataegus viridis, commonly known as the green hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its glossy green leaves, which are elliptical in shape and often have a slight serration along the edges. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by red, juicy berries that are an important food source for birds. Crataegus viridis is typically found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along stream banks, thriving in well-drained soils. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in botanical gardens and natural habitats."
