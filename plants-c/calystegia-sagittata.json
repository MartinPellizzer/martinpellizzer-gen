    "intro": "Calystegia sagittata, commonly known as the arrowleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to North America. It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically lobed and hairy. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and bloom in the early morning. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it both a popular garden plant and an invasive species in some regions."
