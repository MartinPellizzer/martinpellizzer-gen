    "intro": "Coffea carrissoi, commonly known as the Cuban coffee or Carib bean, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba, and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped berries. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture. While not widely cultivated for commercial coffee production, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and historical significance."
