    "intro": "Cephalanthera shizuoi, commonly known as the Shizuoka ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Japan. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive, almost ghostly appearance. The plant is a terrestrial orchid, typically growing in shaded, moist forest environments. Its flowers are usually borne on tall, slender stems and are pollinated by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
