    "intro": "Crocus karduchorum, commonly known as the Karduchian crocus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, early spring blooms. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with three petals and three sepals, typically appearing before the leaves emerge. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
