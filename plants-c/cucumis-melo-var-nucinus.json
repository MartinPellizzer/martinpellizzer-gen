It is characterized by its elongated, slender fruits that typically measure between 15 to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces yellow flowers and has a vine-like growth habit, typical of many cucurbit species. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a matte green surface. The fruit is generally harvested when still immature, offering a crisp, mildly sweet flavor."
