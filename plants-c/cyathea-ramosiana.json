It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizome system supports its upright structure, and it produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds. Cyathea ramosiana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
