    "intro": "Claytonia perfoliata var. depressa, commonly known as the \"Pigface\" or \"Cup Plant,\" is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its foliage. Its unique feature is the way its leaves are fused at the base, forming a cup-like structure that holds rainwater, aiding in the plant's survival. This variety is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is well adapted to full sun conditions."
