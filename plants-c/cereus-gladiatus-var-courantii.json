    "intro": "Cereus gladiatus var. courantii, commonly known as the Courantii Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a tall, columnar cactus with a ribbed stem and spines that provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that are highly fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to desert environments. The varietal form courantii is distinguished by its specific floral characteristics and growth habits."
