    "intro": "Ceropegia taitica, commonly known as the Taiti moonvine, is a climbing plant native to the Pacific islands. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest size. Its unique floral structure includes a specialized corona that aids in pollination by specific insects. Ceropegia taitica is adapted to grow in coastal and rocky habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
