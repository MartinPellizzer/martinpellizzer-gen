It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh climates. The plant features slender, grass-like stems and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and purple. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.
