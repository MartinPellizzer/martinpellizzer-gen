    "intro": "Calothamnus quadrifidus subsp. homalophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bottlebrush, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that are typically red or orange in color. The leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. This subspecies is typically found in sandy or rocky soils in arid or semi-arid regions. It is well adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its succulent stems and reduced leaf surface area."
