    "intro": "Commiphora chevalieri, commonly known as the African myrrh, is a small evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, resinous sap, which has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has small, leathery leaves with a waxy surface. It produces yellowish flowers and small, red fruits that are adapted to dry conditions. The plant's resilience to drought and its unique chemical composition make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
