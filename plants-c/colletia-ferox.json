    "intro": "Colletia ferox, commonly known as the desert holly, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It features succulent, spiny stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in dry, rocky habitats. Colletia ferox is well adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
