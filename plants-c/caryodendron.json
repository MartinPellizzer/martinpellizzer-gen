    "intro": "Caryodendron, commonly known as the tamarind tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a natural dye. The tree produces long, pod-like fruits that contain a sour, pulp-filled seed. The fruit's pulp is widely used in cooking, especially in Indian and Southeast Asian cuisines. Caryodendron is also valued for its wood, which is durable and used in construction and furniture-making."
