    "intro": "Conioselinum anthriscoides, commonly known as the European cow parsley, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbels. Native to Europe, it often grows in moist meadows and woodland edges. The plant has a mild, parsley-like scent and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine. Its botanical features make it easily distinguishable from other similar species in the same family."
