    "intro": "Crataegus spinosa, commonly known as the thorny hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Crataegus spinosa is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
