    "intro": "Cephalaria, commonly known as the \"heal-all\" or \"false hellebore,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are perennial herbs native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. The plants typically have basal rosettes of leaves and produce tall, branched stems with small, clustered yellow or greenish-yellow flowers. They are often found in moist, shady environments such as woodland areas and stream banks. Cephalaria species are valued for their ornamental appeal and have a long history of use in traditional medicine."
