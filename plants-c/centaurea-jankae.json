    "intro": "Centaurea jankae, commonly known as the Jank's cornflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features blue to purple ray florets surrounded by yellow disk florets. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Centaurea jankae is often found in rocky soils and open grasslands, where it thrives in full sun."
