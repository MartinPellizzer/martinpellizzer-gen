    "intro": "Calydorea venezolensis, commonly known as the Venezuelan calydorea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Venezuela. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are often clustered in complex, branched clusters, and it produces small, ovoid fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calydorea venezolensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
