    "intro": "Crataegus denudata, commonly known as the naked-stem hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, often reddish stems that become bare of leaves in winter, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in spring, followed by red berries in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have serrated margins. Crataegus denudata is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in woodland edges, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
