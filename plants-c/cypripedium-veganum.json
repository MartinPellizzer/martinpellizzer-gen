    "intro": "Cypripedium veganum, commonly known as the vegan orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family, native to the temperate forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a single, downward-facing lip and a complex arrangement of petals and sepals. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi to support its nutrient uptake. Its flowers are often pale pink or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators like bees and wasps. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cypripedium veganum is listed as an endangered species in many regions."
