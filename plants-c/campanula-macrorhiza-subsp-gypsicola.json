    "intro": "Campanula macrorhiza subsp. gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, typically from June to August. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found on rocky or gypsum-rich substrates. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
