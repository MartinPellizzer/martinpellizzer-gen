    "intro": "Casuarina campestris, commonly known as the river she-oak, is a hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are clustered in spirals along the branches, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, making it well-suited for dune stabilization and erosion control. Casuarina campestris is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded areas."
