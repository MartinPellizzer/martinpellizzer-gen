    "intro": "Crepidium andamanicum, commonly known as the Andaman bog orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the Andaman Islands. It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments, such as marshes and forest floors, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Its rhizome system allows it to anchor itself in the wetlands it inhabits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
