It is characterized by its lance-shaped, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and orange, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Cuphea lanceolato-ovata is relatively low maintenance and drought-tolerant once established."
