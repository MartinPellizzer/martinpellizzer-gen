    "intro": "Crataegus silvestris, commonly known as the wild hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which are edible but typically tart. Crataegus silvestris is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
