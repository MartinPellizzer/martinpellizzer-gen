It is characterized by its silver-gray, hairy leaves that are broadly ovate to rhombic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, and it thrives in dry, sandy soils. Chrozophora rottleri is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dry grasslands."
