    "intro": "Cyperus linctus, commonly known as the marsh grass or cat's tail sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green to brown in color. Cyperus linctus is known for its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels, making it an important species in aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
