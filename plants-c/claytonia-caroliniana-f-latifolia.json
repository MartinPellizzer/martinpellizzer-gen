    "intro": "Claytonia caroliniana f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved spring beauty, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, often found in woodland habitats. Its foliage and flowers are typically covered in a fine, silvery bloom, which helps to reflect light and conserve moisture. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in native plant gardens."
