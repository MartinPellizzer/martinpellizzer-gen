    "intro": "Caenopteris furcata, commonly known as the forked water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a dense, floating mat on the surface of freshwater habitats. The plant typically grows in slow-moving or still waters, such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself to submerged vegetation or mud. Its rhizomes are wiry and help in spreading the plant across the water's surface. Caenopteris furcata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
