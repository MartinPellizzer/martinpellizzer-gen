    "intro": "Cardamine bicolor, commonly known as the white water crowfoot, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream sides and woodland floors. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive white-veined pattern and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Cardamine bicolor is often found in temperate regions of North America and parts of Europe."
