    "intro": "Cotoneaster nummularius var. typicus, commonly known as the silver cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It features small, glossy, ovate leaves that are typically a vibrant green on top and silvery white underneath, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the autumn. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes. Cotoneaster nummularius var. typicus prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders."
