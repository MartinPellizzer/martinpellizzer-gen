    "intro": "Chamaesyce notoptera, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant typically grows as a low, spreading shrub with small, elliptical leaves that have a silvery-gray appearance due to dense pubescence. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and are clustered in inflorescences called cyathia. Chamaesyce notoptera is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
