    "intro": "Crataegus truculenta, commonly known as the prickly ash or American hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pink flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are oval with serrated edges, and the bark is often flaky and grayish in color. Crataegus truculenta is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
