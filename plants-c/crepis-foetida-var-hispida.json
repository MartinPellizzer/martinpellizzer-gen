It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces yellow flowers that are surrounded by a series of bracts, and it has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often glandular. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. The species is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is particularly noticeable when the flowers are in bloom."
