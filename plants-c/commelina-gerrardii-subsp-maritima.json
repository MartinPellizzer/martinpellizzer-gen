    "intro": "Commelina gerrardii subsp. maritima, commonly known as sea commelina, is a herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It typically grows in sandy or saline soils along the edges of estuaries and tidal marshes. The plant features erect, slender stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, with three blue-violet petals and a distinctive white spathe, which attracts various pollinators. It is adapted to brackish conditions and plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
