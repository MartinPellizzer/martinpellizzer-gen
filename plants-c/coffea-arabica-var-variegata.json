    "intro": "Coffea arabica var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated coffee plant, is a variant of the Arabica coffee species known for its unique leaf patterns. It is a small evergreen shrub native to high-altitude regions of Ethiopia and surrounding areas. The plant produces small, red berries containing two seeds used for coffee production. Its foliage features striking variegation, with white and green streaks that make it popular as an ornamental plant. While it can be grown for coffee, its primary appeal lies in its aesthetic value and adaptability to shaded environments."
