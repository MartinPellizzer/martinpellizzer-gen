It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows to a height of about 10 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its stems are cylindrical and covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. It is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with minimal rainfall."
