    "intro": "Castilleja pilosa var. steenensis, commonly known as the Steen\u2019s hairy leafed milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces bright yellow to orange flowers in the spring. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of its ecological community."
