    "intro": "Cycas circinalis var. javana, commonly known as the Javan cycad, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia. It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, making it a long-lived ornamental species. Its reproductive structures include a large, cone-like structure that produces both male and female spores, typical of cycads. The Javan cycad is also valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
