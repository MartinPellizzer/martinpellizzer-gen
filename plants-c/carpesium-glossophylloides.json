    "intro": "Carpesium glossophylloides, commonly known as the Mexican thistle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to Mexico and has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive. The plant features spiny, bract-like leaves and produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a noxious weed in many areas."
