    "intro": "Cleistes pluriflora, commonly known as the many-flowered cleistocarp, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its parasitic nature. The plant produces small, white, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that are typically closed (cleistogamous), which means they do not open for pollination. Cleistes pluriflora thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its unique floral structure and parasitic growth habits make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
