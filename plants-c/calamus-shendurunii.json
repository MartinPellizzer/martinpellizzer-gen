    "intro": "Calamus shendurunii, commonly known as the Shendurunii cane, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of India and Myanmar. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems that are often used for making handicrafts and musical instruments. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth, waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bloom into yellowish flowers, contributing to its ornamental value."
