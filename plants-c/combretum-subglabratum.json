    "intro": "Combretum subglabratum, commonly known as the African flame bush, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and showy, orange-red flowers that appear in winter. The leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a slightly hairy texture, though they become smoother as the plant matures. The plant is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky soils or along riverbanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
