    "intro": "Curarea tomentocarpa, commonly known as the tomentose curare plant, is a woody shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is notable for containing curare-like alkaloids, which have been historically used for hunting purposes. Its roots and stems are the primary parts used for extracting these toxic compounds. Due to its medicinal and toxic properties, it is of interest in both ethnobotanical and pharmacological research."
