    "intro": "Cycas conferta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Cycas conferta is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight. Due to its ancient lineage and unique morphology, it is of significant interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
