    "intro": "Cruciata taurica, commonly known as the Crimean crucifix, is a flowering plant native to the steppes of southern Ukraine and the Crimea. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright stem and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that resemble a cross, hence its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to the harsh climate of its native region. Cruciata taurica is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along the edges of woodlands."
