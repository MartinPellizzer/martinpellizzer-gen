    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis acutiformis f. yanagidae, commonly known as the Yanagida's sharp-leafed evergreen oak, is a rare variant of the cyclobalanopsis genus. It is characterized by its elongated, pointed leaves that are typically\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) and glossy in texture. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of southern Japan, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. It produces small, clustered flowers followed by hard, woody fruits containing single seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
