    "intro": "Campanula oxyphylla, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Campanula oxyphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine conditions."
