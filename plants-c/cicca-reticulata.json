    "intro": "Cicca reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feathery leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones spherical. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
