    "intro": "Cerothamnus, commonly known as silverleaf bush or silverleaf buckwheat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or subshrubs, characterized by their silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs. They are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries like Namibia and South Africa. The flowers are small and usually white or pale blue, arranged in clusters, and they bloom during the warmer months. Cerothamnus species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
