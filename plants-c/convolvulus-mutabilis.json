    "intro": "Convolvulus mutabilis, commonly known as the morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its heliotropic (sun-following) behavior, with flowers opening in the morning and closing at dusk. The plant produces trumpet-shaped, five-petaled flowers in a range of colors, including blue, purple, and pink. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, often growing as a climbing vine. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens and as a cut flower."
