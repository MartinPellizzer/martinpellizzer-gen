It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowering heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, which attract various pollinators.
