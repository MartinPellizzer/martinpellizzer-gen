    "intro": "Calystegia glaziovii, commonly known as the Glaziov's morning glory, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, elliptical seeds. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
