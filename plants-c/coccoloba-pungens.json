    "intro": "Coccoloba pungens, commonly known as the prickly coral tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often covered in small, sharp spines. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are three-lobed berries that turn red when mature. Coccoloba pungens is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature."
