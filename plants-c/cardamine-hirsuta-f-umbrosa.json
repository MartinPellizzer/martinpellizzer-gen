    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta f. umbrosa, commonly known as the hairy water-crowfoot, is a variant of the broadleaf water-crowfoot. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in a loose, branched inflorescence. The subspecies is notable for its adaptation to low-light conditions and its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, wet soils."
