    "intro": "Cladopus austro-osumiensis, commonly known as the Austro-Osumi Cladopus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Japan. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible roots. The plant features upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
