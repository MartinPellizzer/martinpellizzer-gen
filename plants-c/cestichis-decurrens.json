    "intro": "Cestichis decurrens, commonly known as the creeping cestichis, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a sprawling growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, linear to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Cestichis decurrens is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
