    "intro": "Comocladia cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf comocladia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a small shrub characterized by its simple, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically green when mature and turn red upon ripening. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater sources. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially grown."
