    "intro": "Cordia krauseana, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red cedar, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and small, opposite leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by round, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forest or scrubland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic and practical properties."
