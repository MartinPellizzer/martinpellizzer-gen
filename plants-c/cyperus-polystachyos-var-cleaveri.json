    "intro": "Cyperus polystachyos var. cleaveri, commonly known as cleavers, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, ditches, and along stream banks. Cleavers are known for their ability to adhere to clothing and animal fur, which aids in seed dispersal."
