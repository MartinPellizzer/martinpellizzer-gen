    "intro": "Coursetia polyphylla var. breviloba, commonly known as the short-leaf coursetia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along canyon walls. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
