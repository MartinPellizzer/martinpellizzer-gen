    "intro": "Cupaniopsis tomentella, commonly known as the wooly cupaniopsis, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly silver-white foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is relatively rare in the wild."
