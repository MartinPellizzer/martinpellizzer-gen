    "intro": "Carex caricina var. glaucina, commonly known as the glaucous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually bluish-green, giving it a distinctive appearance, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
