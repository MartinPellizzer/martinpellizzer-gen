    "intro": "Cestrum miradorense, commonly known as the Mirador nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that typically bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a mild, sweet taste. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and unique blooming pattern, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
