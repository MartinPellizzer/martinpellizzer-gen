    "intro": "Croton glandulosus var. arenicola, commonly known as the sand croton, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its rough, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant in drought-tolerant gardens."
