    "intro": "Cardamine pentaphylla, commonly known as the five-leaf watercress, is a delicate flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to moist, shaded environments in North America, particularly in the eastern United States. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, allowing it to thrive in wet soils or shallow water. The plant is often found in stream banks, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
