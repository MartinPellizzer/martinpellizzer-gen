    "intro": "Calycadenia fremontii, commonly known as Fremont's globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and open woodlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Calycadenia fremontii is an important species for pollinators and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
