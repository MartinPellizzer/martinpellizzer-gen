    "intro": "Crotalaria trachycarpa, commonly known as the rough-seeded crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a plant of caution due to its toxic properties."
