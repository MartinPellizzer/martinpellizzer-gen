    "intro": "Corydalis ambigua, commonly known as the variable corydalis, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, purple, or white. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces slender, branching stems that rise above the foliage. Corydalis ambigua is often found in rocky or woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is adapted to thrive in cool, moist environments."
