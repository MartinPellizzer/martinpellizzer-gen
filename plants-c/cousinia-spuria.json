    "intro": "Cousinia spuria, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and hairy stems that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve moisture in harsh environments. Cousinia spuria is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to survive in conditions of extreme drought."
