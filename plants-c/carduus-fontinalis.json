    "intro": "Carduus fontinalis, commonly known as water thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near water sources."
