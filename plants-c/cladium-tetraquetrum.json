    "intro": "Cladium tetraquetrum, commonly known as the four-sided sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and swampy habitats in the Americas. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically four-sided in cross-section, a feature that aids in its identification. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Cladium tetraquetrum thrives in saturated soils and is often found in regions with high humidity and abundant water. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
