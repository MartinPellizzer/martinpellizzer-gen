It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
