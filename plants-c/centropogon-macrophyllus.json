It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in coastal areas and along riverbanks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a pollinator attractant and its use in traditional medicine."
