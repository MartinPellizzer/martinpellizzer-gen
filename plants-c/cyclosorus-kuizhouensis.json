    "intro": "[WRONG START] Cyclosorus kuizzhouensis, commonly known as the Kuizhou cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern native to China. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that form a rosette. The plant has four leaflets arranged in a cross shape, which is a distinctive feature of the genus Cyclosorus. It thrives in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an important species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
