    "intro": "Cristaria larranagae, commonly known as the Larranaga's starwort, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of Peru. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple, typically during the dry season. The plant has a low-growing habit with delicate, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
