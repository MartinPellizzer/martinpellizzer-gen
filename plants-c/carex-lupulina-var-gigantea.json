    "intro": "Carex lupulina var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant bulrush, is a tall, herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the top of the stems, which are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. This variety is notable for its robust growth and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats."
