    "intro": "Cheilanthes pruinata, commonly known as the pruinose rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows on rocky outcrops and in crevices, where it thrives in well-drained, dry conditions. The plant is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving it a powdery appearance. It has a robust rhizome system that allows it to survive in harsh environments with minimal water. Cheilanthes pruinata is well adapted to drought, making it a resilient and hardy species in its native habitat."
