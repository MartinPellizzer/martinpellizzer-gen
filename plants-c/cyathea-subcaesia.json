    "intro": "Cyathea subcaesia, commonly known as the silver tree cycad, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a silvery or grayish hue. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
