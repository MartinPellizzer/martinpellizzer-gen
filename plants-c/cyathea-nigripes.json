    "intro": "Cyathea nigripes, commonly known as the black-stemmed tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome system supports the development of its robust trunk and dense root network. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value in tropical gardens."
