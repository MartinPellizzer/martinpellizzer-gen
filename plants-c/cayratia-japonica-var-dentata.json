It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which give it the species name *dentata*. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange-red berries. It is a vigorous climber that thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden use, though it can be invasive in some regions."
