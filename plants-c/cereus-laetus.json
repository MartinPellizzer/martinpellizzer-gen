    "intro": "Cereus laetus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to produce large, showy white flowers at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. Its flowers open only during the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Cereus laetus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming habit."
