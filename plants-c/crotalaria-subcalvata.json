    "intro": "Crotalaria subcalvata, commonly known as the hairy crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and pinnate leaves. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its seeds are enclosed in pods, and the plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility. However, it can be invasive in some areas and may cause skin irritation due to its toxic compounds."
