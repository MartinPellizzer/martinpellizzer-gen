It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas with a Mediterranean climate. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping and for erosion control."
