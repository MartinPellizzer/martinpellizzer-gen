    "intro": "Cydonia silvestris var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf quince, is a small, deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It produces fragrant, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, green fruits that ripen to a golden-orange color in late summer. The plant has a bushy growth habit with rough, warty bark and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. Its fruits are often used in cooking, though they are generally less sweet and more tart compared to common quinces. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in dry, well-drained soils."
