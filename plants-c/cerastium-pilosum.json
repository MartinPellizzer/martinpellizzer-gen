    "intro": "Cerastium pilosum, commonly known as hairy mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Cerastium pilosum is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is known for its hardy nature and ability to spread through stolons."
