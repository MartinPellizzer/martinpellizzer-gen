    "intro": "Carduus boujartii, commonly known as the Boujart's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust, spiny stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with deeply lobed, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers with a distinctive purple center, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves and stems are covered in stiff, prickly bracts that serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Carduus boujartii is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
