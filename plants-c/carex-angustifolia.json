    "intro": "Carex angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and a dense cluster of spikelets at the top. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Carex angustifolia is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
