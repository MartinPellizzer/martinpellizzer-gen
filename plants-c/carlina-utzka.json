    "intro": "Carlina utzka, commonly known as the mountain carline thistle, is a perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves and a tall, sparsely branched stem that bears blue to purple flower heads. The plant produces composite flowers, with both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Carlina utzka is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and healing properties."
