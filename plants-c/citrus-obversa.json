    "intro": "Citrus obversa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lime, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces smooth, green, and often seedless fruits that are similar in appearance to limes. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and mild citrus fragrance. Due to its limited natural range, it is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
