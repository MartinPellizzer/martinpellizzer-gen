    "intro": "Convolvulus plebeius, commonly known as the common bindweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a perennial vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in gardens. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
