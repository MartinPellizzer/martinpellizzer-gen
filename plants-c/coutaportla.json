    "intro": "Coutaportla, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
