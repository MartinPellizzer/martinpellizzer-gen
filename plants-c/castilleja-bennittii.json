    "intro": "Castilleja bennittii, commonly known as Bennett's paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a slender, erect stem with whorled leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its nectar-rich flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
