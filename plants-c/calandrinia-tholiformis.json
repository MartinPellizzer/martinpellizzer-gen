    "intro": "Calandrinia tholiformis, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and leaves, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Its flowers are typically pink to purple in color and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Calandrinia tholiformis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
