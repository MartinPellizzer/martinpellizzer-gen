    "intro": "Chiloglottis sylvestris, commonly known as the black mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae. It is native to eastern Australia and typically grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pinkish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are dark red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked."
