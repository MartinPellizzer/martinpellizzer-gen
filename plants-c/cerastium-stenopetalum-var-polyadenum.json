    "intro": "Cerastium stenopetalum var. polyadenum, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its compact growth habit and early blooming make it a valuable plant for ground cover in natural habitats."
