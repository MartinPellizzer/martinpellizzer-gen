    "intro": "Carex nigromarginata f. minor, commonly known as the narrow-margin sedge, is a compact, clump-forming perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green with a distinctive dark brown or black margin along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets that are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forested areas. This ornamental plant is valued for its fine texture and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
