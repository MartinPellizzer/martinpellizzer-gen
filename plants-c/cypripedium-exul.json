    "intro": "Cypripedium exul, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and dense clusters of pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, fragrant lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires specific soil conditions to thrive. It has a long flowering period, often blooming from late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
