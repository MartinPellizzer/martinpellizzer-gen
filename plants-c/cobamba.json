    "intro": "Cobamba, commonly known as the \"false arrowhead,\" is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped leaves and a spadix inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wet, shady environments such as marshes and along riverbanks. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. However, it is important to note that the plant contains calcium oxalate crystals, which can cause irritation if ingested."
