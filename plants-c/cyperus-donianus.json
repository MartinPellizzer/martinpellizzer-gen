    "intro": "Cyperus donianus, commonly known as the donian flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense stands, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like with a slightly rough texture. Cyperus donianus produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
