    "intro": "Centrosema unifoliolatum, commonly known as the single leaf clusterbean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, palmately compound leaf with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by cylindrical, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in agroforestry systems due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and agricultural purposes."
