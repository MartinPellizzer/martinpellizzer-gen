    "intro": "Capparis portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican caper, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and aromatic, often yellow or white, flowers. The plant produces small, round, green fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in coastal areas and dry forests, adapting to the island's tropical climate. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in certain conservation areas."
