    "intro": "Centaurea sibirica, commonly known as Siberian knapweed, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Asia and Europe. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and rocky environments. The plant features bright blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Centaurea sibirica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
