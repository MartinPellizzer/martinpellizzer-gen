    "intro": "Combretum stelligerum, commonly known as the coastal combretum, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. Its ability to tolerate coastal conditions makes it an important component of coastal vegetation."
