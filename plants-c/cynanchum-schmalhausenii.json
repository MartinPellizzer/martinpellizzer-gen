    "intro": "Cynanchum schmalhausenii, commonly known as Schmalhausen's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweed species, and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruit is a follicle containing numerous tiny seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
