    "intro": "Cynanchum asperum, commonly known as the rough milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided as a medicinal or ornamental plant."
