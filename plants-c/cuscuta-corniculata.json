    "intro": "Cuscuta corniculata, commonly known as the horned dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it can be found growing on a variety of herbaceous and woody plants. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for many years, allowing it to persist in infested areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural and ornamental crops."
