It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and often compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Crotalaria gracillima is often found in moist, open habitats like grasslands and wetlands. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, hairy pod that splits open when mature to release the seeds."
