    "intro": "Cirsium hydrophilum var. hydrophilum, commonly known as the water thistle, is a perennial herb native to wetland areas of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams, ponds, and marshes. Its botanical features make it well adapted to aquatic and semi-aquatic environments."
