It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its narrow, linear leaves and small yellow flowers contribute to its distinctive appearance. Chevaliera lateralis is often found in fynbos vegetation, which is a unique biome in South Africa."
