It is characterized by its striking red or pink flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
