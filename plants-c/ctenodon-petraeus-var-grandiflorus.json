    "intro": "Ctenodon petraeus var. grandiflorus, commonly known as the rock ctenodon, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky substrates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in low-water conditions."
