    "intro": "Cupania seemannii var. fosteri, commonly known as the Foster's cupania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, featuring simple, alternate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, typically greenish-yellow in color. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild."
