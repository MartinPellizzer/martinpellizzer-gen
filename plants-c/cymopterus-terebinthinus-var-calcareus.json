    "intro": "Cymopterus terebinthinus var. calcareus, commonly known as the California buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils, often found in dry, open habitats like grasslands and rocky slopes. Its adaptability to calcareous soils makes it an important component of xeric ecosystems."
