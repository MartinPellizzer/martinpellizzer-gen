    "intro": "Coelogyne aborta, commonly known as the abortive orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Coelogyne aborta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a warm, humid environment."
