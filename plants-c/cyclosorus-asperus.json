    "intro": "Cyclosorus asperus, commonly known as the rough cyclosorus, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Peltasporaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a dorsiventral leaf-like structure, and its surface is covered in rough, papillose cells that give it its common name. It reproduces via spores, which are released from small, cup-like structures called peridia. Cyclosorus asperus is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and habitat conditions due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
