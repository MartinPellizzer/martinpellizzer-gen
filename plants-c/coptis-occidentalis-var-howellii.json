    "intro": "Coptis occidentalis var. howellii, commonly known as Howell's goldthread, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its slender, yellowish stems and small, palmate leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
