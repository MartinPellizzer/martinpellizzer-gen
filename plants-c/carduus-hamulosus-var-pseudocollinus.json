    "intro": "Carduus hamulosus var. pseudocollinus, commonly known as the spiked sowthistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of spiny, hairy leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by bristly, spiny seed heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical characteristics make it easily identifiable and distinguishable from other similar species in the Asteraceae family."
