    "intro": "Cyanococcus elliottii, commonly known as Elliott's sea holly, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by narrow, grass-like bracts. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Cyanococcus elliottii is also valued for its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion in coastal environments."
