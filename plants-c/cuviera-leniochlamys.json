    "intro": "Cuviera leniochlamys, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Cuviera leniochlamys is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
