    "intro": "Cynapium apiifolium, commonly known as cow parsley, is a biennial plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or greenish-white flowers that appear in umbrella-like clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shady areas and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. It has a distinct aromatic scent when crushed, due to the presence of volatile oils in its foliage. The plant is also known for its edible leaves and seeds, which have been used in traditional herbal remedies."
