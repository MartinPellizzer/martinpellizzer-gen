    "intro": "Carex nigra f. microstachys, commonly known as black sedge, is a variant of the common sedges, characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America, typically found in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, bogs, and wet meadows. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in wet environments. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in tight spikes, and it produces triangular, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by water or wind. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
