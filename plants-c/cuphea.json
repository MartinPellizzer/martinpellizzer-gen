    "intro": "Cuphea, commonly known as the \"whispering bells,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lythraceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, pink, and purple. Cuphea species are often cultivated for their ornamental value, with many varieties being popular in gardens and as container plants. They prefer well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. The genus includes over 200 species, many of which are used in horticulture for their vibrant blooms and ease of care."
