    "intro": "Calligonum \u00d7 platyacanthum, commonly known as the hybrid sandmat, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a cross between Calligonum species, characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and thick, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive drought conditions. Its ability to stabilize sandy soils makes it valuable for ecological restoration projects."
