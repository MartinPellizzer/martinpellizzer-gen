It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, providing a drought-tolerant feature. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
