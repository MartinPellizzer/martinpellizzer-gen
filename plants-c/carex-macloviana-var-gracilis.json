It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants commonly found in moist or aquatic habitats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to brown flowers. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along stream banks. This variety is characterized by its slender stems and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
