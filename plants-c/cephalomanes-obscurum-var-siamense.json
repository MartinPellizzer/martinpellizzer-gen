    "intro": "Cephalomanes obscurum var. siamense, commonly known as the Siam dark-headed plant, is a rare and less-studied species within the Cephalomanes genus. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and compact growth habit, typically found in shaded, humid environments. The plant exhibits unique morphological features, including specialized leaf structures that aid in moisture retention. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in inflorescences at the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant but poorly understood species."
