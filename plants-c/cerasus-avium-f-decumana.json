It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, often clustered flowers compared to the typical species. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and the bark is smooth and reddish-brown in color. This form is often found in mountainous regions and thrives in well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in horticulture and traditional medicine."
