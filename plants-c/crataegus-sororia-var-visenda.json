    "intro": "Crataegus sororia var. visenda, commonly known as the visenda hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, featuring thorny branches and oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a tart flavor. Its botanical characteristics include simple, alternate leaves and a woody structure typical of the Rosaceae family. This variety is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, contributing to local biodiversity."
