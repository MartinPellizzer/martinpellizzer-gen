    "intro": "Coelogyne macrophylla, commonly known as the giant coelogyne, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that can reach up to 15 cm in length. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with a distinct yellow lip that attracts pollinators. Coelogyne macrophylla is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms."
