It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, making it a common sight in marshy areas and along waterways. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a cylindrical stem that is often slightly hairy. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms."
