    "intro": "Carex stricta f. riartiana, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a variant of the common bulrush, characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, forming dense clumps with erect, cylindrical stems. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-ranked spikelets, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize shorelines and improve water quality."
