    "intro": "Castalis nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stalked castalis, is a herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a slender, upright stem that is often hairless, giving it its common name. Its small, white or greenish flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Castalis nudicaulis is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its aesthetic appeal in natural landscapes."
