    "intro": "Chelone cheilanthifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf forget-me-not, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are arranged in loose racemes and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
