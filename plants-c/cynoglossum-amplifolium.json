    "intro": "Cynoglossum amplifolium, commonly known as broadleaf mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Cynoglossum amplifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
