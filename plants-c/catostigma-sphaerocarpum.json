    "intro": "Catostigma sphaerocarpum, commonly known as the globular cup fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, rounded, cup-like spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the undersides of its fronds. The plant has slender, wiry fronds with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and its leaves are typically divided into small, finger-like segments. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and indirect light to flourish. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
