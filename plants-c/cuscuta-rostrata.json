    "intro": "Cuscuta rostrata, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a weak, thread-like stem that wraps around its host. The plant is widespread in North America and can be found on a variety of host species, including grasses and forbs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
