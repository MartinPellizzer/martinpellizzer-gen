    "intro": "Cactus krameri, commonly known as the silver cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, sprawling plant with a distinctive appearance featuring spiny stems and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer, are often pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths."
