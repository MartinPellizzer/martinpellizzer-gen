    "intro": "Corallorhiza striata, commonly known as the streaked coralroot, is a striking member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and reliance on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients. This herbaceous plant produces tall, slender stems with whorled, linear leaves that are often reddish or brownish in color. It blooms with showy, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, arranged in a spike-like cluster. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found growing in association with other orchids. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
