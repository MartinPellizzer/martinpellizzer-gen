    "intro": "Calandrinia virgata, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in the early morning. Calandrinia virgata is adapted to hot, dry environments and has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in sandy soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
