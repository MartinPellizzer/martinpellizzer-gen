    "intro": "Cheilanthes humilis, commonly known as the rock spurge or lesser rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows on rocky outcrops and in dry, well-drained soils, showcasing its adaptation to harsh environments. The plant has a creeping rhizome with dense, clustered fronds that are leathery and often covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are usually short and broad, with a distinctive, pale green color and a waxy surface. Cheilanthes humilis is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
