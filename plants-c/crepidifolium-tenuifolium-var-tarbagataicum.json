    "intro": "Crepidifolium tenuifolium var. tarbagataicum, commonly known as the Tarbagatai crepidifolium, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white in color and appear in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change."
