    "intro": "Cistus hirtus, commonly known as the hairy rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its greyish, hairy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid environments. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening. Cistus hirtus also plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat."
