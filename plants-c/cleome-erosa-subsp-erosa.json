    "intro": "Cleome erosa subsp. erosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf cleome, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southeastern United States. It features branched stems that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in loose, branched inflorescences, which bloom from summer to early fall. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with serrated margins and a slightly hairy surface. Cleome erosa subsp. erosa is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in open woodlands, where it thrives in full sun."
