    "intro": "Calamina themeda, commonly known as the tall grass bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the grasslands of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, erect stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and establish dense stands. Calamina themeda is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
