It features dense, dark green foliage and produces large, showy pink or white flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. It is widely cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. Due to its cold hardiness, it is suitable for coastal and maritime climates."
