    "intro": "Cerastium vulgatum subsp. lucorum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and garden beds. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via stolons make it a common weed in cultivated areas."
