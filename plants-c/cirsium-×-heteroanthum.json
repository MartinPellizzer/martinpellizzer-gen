    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 heteroanthum, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant characterized by its spiny leaves and showy purple to pink flowers. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Cirsium vulgare and Cirsium palustre, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils in wetlands and along stream banks. Its foliage is covered in stiff, bristly hairs, and the flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
