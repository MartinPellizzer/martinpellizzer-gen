    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 vulgaris var. folio-crispa, commonly known as the curly leaf lemon, is a variant of the lemon plant characterized by its distinctive, wavy, and crinkled leaves. This cultivar is a hybrid between the lemon (Citrus \u00d7 limon) and the pomelo (Citrus maxima), resulting in unique botanical features. The leaves are typically smaller and more textured compared to standard lemon varieties, adding ornamental value to the plant. It produces small, yellow fruits similar to regular lemons, though they may be less abundant. The plant thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often cultivated for both its aesthetic appeal and edible yield."
