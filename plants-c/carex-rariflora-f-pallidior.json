    "intro": "Carex rariflora f. pallidior, commonly known as the pale-flowered sedge, is a variant of the rare sedge Carex rariflora. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and pale green to whitish flower spikes, which distinguish it from the typical green-flowered form. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. It is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense clumps. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
