It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and limited sunlight, making it well-suited to its alpine and subalpine habitats."
