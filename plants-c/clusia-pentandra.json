    "intro": "Clusia pentandra, commonly known as the waxtree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Clusia pentandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate salt spray, making it suitable for coastal landscaping."
