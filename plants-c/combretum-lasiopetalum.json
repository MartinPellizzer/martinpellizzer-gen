    "intro": "Combretum lasiopetalum, commonly known as the red-flowered flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking red, pink, or orange flowers that appear in dense clusters during the warmer months. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Combretum lasiopetalum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
