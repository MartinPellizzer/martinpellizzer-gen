    "intro": "Chthonocephalus tomentellus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and striking, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its delicate structure and habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered critically endangered in many regions."
