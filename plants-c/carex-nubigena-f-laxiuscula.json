    "intro": "Carex nubigena f. laxiuscula, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a variant of the alpine sedge species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale to greenish flowers. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its foliage is typically covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, giving it a distinctive, frosty appearance. The plant is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and hardiness."
