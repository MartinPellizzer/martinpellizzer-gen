    "intro": "Carpinus laxiflora f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved hornbeam, is a rare horticultural form of the hornbeam genus. It is characterized by its notably larger leaves compared to the typical species, which are ovate to elliptic in shape and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
