    "intro": "Coccinia aostae, commonly known as the Aosta morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. Coccinia aostae is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some botanical gardens, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
