    "intro": "Ctenitis pulchra, commonly known as the elegant sea holly, is a coastal plant native to the Pacific coast of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, spiny leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Ctenitis pulchra plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
