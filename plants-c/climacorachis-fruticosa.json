    "intro": "Climacorachis fruticosa, commonly known as the mountain thorn, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, edible berries. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky soils. Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in mountainous areas."
