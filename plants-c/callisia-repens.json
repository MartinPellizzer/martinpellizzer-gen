    "intro": "Callisia repens, commonly known as the wandering begonia, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a trailing perennial that produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant has fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-draining soil and partial to full sunlight. Its ability to spread horizontally makes it an excellent choice for hanging baskets or as a ground cover."
