    "intro": "Catasetum fuliginosum, commonly known as the sooty catasetum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark, sooty-colored flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers emit a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which attracts specific pollinators like flies. Catasetum fuliginosum is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
