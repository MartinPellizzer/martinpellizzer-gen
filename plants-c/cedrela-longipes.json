    "intro": "Cedrela longipes, commonly known as the longipes mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, simple leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species."
