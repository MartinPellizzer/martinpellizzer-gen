    "intro": "Commelina diffusa var. parva, commonly known as the small commelina, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Commelinaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers with three petals and three sepals, often accompanied by prominent bracts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
