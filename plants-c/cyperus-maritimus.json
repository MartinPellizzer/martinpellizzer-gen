    "intro": "Cyperus maritimus, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to coastal and marshy environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation. Cyperus maritimus plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal areas."
