    "intro": "Calibrachoa ericifolia, commonly known as the heather bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse displays of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring and summer, producing vibrant pink to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, hairy, and often clustered at the base, giving it a dense, ornamental appearance. Calibrachoa ericifolia is well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings due to its preference for well-drained soil and full sun."
