    "intro": "Celtis politoria, commonly known as the African hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Elaeocarpaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, white flowers followed by yellowish-green berries that are edible for some bird species. Celtis politoria is often found in savannas and along riverbanks, where it contributes to local biodiversity. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a resilient and widely distributed plant in its native habitat."
