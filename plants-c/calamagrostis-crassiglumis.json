It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and broad, flat leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland gardens and ecological restoration projects."
