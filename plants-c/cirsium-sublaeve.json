    "intro": "Cirsium sublaeve, commonly known as the smooth thistle, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and open habitats. The plant's structure includes a tall, branched stem with a woolly coating, and its leaves are usually covered in fine, soft hairs. It is often found in meadows, wastelands, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
