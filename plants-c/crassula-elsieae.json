It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge, especially when exposed to bright light. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens."
