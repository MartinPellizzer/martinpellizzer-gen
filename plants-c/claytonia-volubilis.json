    "intro": "Claytonia volubilis, commonly known as the running hen and chicks, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in the spring. It spreads via rhizomes, forming dense mats that can cover large areas. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover in moist, shady environments."
