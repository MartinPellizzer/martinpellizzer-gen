    "intro": "Cercinia elongata, commonly known as the African bristle fern, is a unique plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, bristle-like pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. Cercinia elongata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along riverbanks."
