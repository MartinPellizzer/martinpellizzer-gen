It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers in the summer, which are followed by triangular, grass-like seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. This variety is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
