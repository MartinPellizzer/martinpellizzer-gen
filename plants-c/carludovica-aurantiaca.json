    "intro": "Carludovica aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to southern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces bright orange flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a vibrant color to its surroundings. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Carludovica aurantiaca is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water once established."
