    "intro": "Cirsium pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features spiny, lobed leaves and produces small, purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Cirsium pauciflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
