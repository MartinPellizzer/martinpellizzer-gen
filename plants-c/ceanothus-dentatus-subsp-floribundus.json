    "intro": "Ceanothus dentatus subsp. floribundus, commonly known as the showy ceanothus, is a shrub native to California and parts of Nevada. It features dense, evergreen foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant blue or violet flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in its native habitat."
