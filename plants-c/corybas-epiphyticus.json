    "intro": "Corybas epiphyticus, commonly known as the epiphytic ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a distinctive, hood-like structure. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered endangered in many regions."
