    "intro": "Carpodinus rufinervis, commonly known as the red-veined nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Urticaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves with prominent red veins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its stinging hairs, like those of other nettle species, can cause skin irritation upon contact."
