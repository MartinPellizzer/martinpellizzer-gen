    "intro": "Crupina brachypappa, commonly known as coastal crupina, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils along the shoreline. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread along coastal dunes and beaches. Crupina brachypappa is often considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new habitats."
