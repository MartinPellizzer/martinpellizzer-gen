    "intro": "Carex rara subsp. capillacea, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, a common reproductive strategy among sedges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and shaded woodlands. Due to its delicate foliage and ecological importance, it is a valued plant in native garden landscapes."
