    "intro": "Coleosanthus abbreviatus, commonly known as the short-stemmed sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically bright yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found growing near the shoreline. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
