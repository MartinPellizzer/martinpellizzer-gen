    "intro": "Crepidomanes liukiuense, commonly known as the Ryukyu crepidomanes, is a rare flowering plant native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and is often found in rocky or limestone soils. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation and conservation. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
