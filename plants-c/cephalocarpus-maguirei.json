    "intro": "Cephalocarpus maguirei, commonly known as the Maguire's headcup, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its distinctive, helmet-shaped fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swamps, where it thrives in the understory. Its leaves are opposite and oval, with a smooth texture, while its flowers are small and white, often clustered in inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cephalocarpus maguirei is considered a species of conservation concern."
