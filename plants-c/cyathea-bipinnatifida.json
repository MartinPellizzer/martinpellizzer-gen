    "intro": "Cyathea bipinnatifida, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of pinnate fronds, which are divided into smaller pinnae, giving it a lush, tropical appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The fronds are used in traditional medicine and basket-making in some cultures."
