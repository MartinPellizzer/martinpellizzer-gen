    "intro": "Carex filipes var. filipes, commonly known as the slender filifera sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its native environment. The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
