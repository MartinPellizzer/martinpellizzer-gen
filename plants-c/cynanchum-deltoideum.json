    "intro": "Cynanchum deltoideum, commonly known as Delta Milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly found in the southeastern region. It is a member of the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes other milkweeds, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by seed pods containing fluffy, white seeds with silky appendages, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woods, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas."
