    "intro": "Cynanchum chinense, commonly known as Chinese devil's backbone, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicles containing seeds with silky hairs. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
