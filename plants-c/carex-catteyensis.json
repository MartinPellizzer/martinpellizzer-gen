    "intro": "Carex catteyensis, commonly known as the cattey's sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Native to the southeastern United States, it typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for wind pollination. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
