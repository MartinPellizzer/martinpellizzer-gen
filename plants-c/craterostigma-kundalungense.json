    "intro": "Craterostigma kundalungense, commonly known as the Kundalung Valley grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Poaceae family, commonly known as grasses, and is characterized by its compact rosette structure and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is notable for its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil quality. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
