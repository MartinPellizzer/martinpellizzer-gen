    "intro": "Centropogon leucophyllus var. minimus, commonly known as the dwarf bluebottle, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, tubular blue to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils in open habitats like pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native environment. This variety is a smaller form of the species, distinguished by its reduced size and floral characteristics."
