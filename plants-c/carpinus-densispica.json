    "intro": "Carpinus densispica, commonly known as the European hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, smooth, gray bark and its oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, spherical berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas, contributing to biodiversity in its habitat."
