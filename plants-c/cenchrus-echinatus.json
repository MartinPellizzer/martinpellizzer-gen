    "intro": "Cenchrus echinatus, commonly known as the spiny grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and the presence of stiff, spiny hairs on its leaves and stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous roots make it a valuable forage plant for livestock in arid and semi-arid regions. Cenchrus echinatus is also known for its adaptability to poor soil conditions and its ability to thrive in dry environments."
