It features dense, fleshy foliage that forms a compact, shrub-like structure. The leaves are typically blue-gray in color, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
