    "intro": "Carex drejeriana, commonly known as the Greenland sedge, is a perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in tundra or rocky habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form clumps or mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its environment. Carex drejeriana is an important component of the vegetation in its native ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
