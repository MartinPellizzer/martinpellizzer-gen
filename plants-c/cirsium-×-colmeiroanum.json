    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 colmeiroanum, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and showy purple or pink flower heads that resemble those of other thistle species. This hybrid plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, often thriving in disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
