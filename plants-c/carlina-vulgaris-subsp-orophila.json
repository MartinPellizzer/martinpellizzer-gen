    "intro": "Carlina vulgaris subsp. orophila, commonly known as the alpine carline thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, woolly leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, spherical clusters, which are surrounded by bracts that resemble a crown. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Carlina vulgaris subsp. orophila is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats at high altitudes."
