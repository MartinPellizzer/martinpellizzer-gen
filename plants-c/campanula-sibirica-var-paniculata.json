    "intro": "Campanula sibirica var. paniculata, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces long, slender stems that bear multiple flowering branches, creating a cascading effect. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and slightly hairy, providing a textured appearance. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
