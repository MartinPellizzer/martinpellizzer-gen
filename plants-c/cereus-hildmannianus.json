    "intro": "Cereus hildmannianus, commonly known as the Hildmann's candleplant, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Cuba and the Bahamas. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height, covered with sharp, spine-like structures. The plant produces large, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, opening at night. These flowers are pollinated by moths and bats, reflecting its nocturnal blooming habit. Cereus hildmannianus is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and exhibiting succulent features typical of the Cactaceae family."
