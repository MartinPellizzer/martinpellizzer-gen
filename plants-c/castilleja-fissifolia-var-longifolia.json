    "intro": "Castilleja fissifolia var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf castilleja, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant features showy, red to orange-red bract-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and the stems are often branched, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
