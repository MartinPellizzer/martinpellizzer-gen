It features small, alternate leaves that are often hairy, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or greenish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its flowers are typically borne on slender, erect stems that rise above the foliage. The species is valued for its ability to thrive in moist conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
