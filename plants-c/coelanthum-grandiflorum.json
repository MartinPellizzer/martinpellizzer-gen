    "intro": "Coelanthum grandiflorum, commonly known as the giant rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, showy flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is adapted to grow in rocky or well-drained soils. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with a distinct lip or labellum that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. Coelanthum grandiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of alpine flora."
