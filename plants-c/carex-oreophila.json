    "intro": "Carex oreophila, commonly known as the mountain sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Carex oreophila plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
