    "intro": "Chamaesyce celastroides var. nelsonii, commonly known as Nelson's sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the southwestern United States. It features fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert habitats. Its succulent leaves and drought tolerance make it an important component of xerophytic plant communities."
