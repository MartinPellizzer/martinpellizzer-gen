    "intro": "Chamaepeuce alpini var. camptolepis, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a low-growing rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in many areas."
