    "intro": "Condaliopsis velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, velvety-textured leaves. The plant produces showy, often fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
