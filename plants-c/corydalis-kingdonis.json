    "intro": "Corydalis kingdonis, commonly known as the Kingdon's Corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Corydalis kingdonis thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring blooming habit and unique floral structure."
