    "intro": "Colutea arborescens var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved broomrape, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
