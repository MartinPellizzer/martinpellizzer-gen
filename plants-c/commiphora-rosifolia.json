    "intro": "Commiphora rosifolia, commonly known as the rose-scented myrrh tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh trees, and is characterized by its aromatic resins. The plant produces a distinctive, rose-like fragrance when its leaves are crushed, which is due to the presence of volatile oils. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, leathery leaves with a waxy coating. The plant is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine and perfumery."
