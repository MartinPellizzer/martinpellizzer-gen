    "intro": "Cornus walteri, commonly known as Walter's dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy white bracts that surround small, yellowish flowers, which appear in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and has opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its fruit is a red, fleshy drupe that matures in the fall, providing food for birds and small mammals. Cornus walteri is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
