    "intro": "Calyptraria, commonly known as the \"butterfly lichen,\" is a type of lichen that belongs to the family Caloplacaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, often forming dense, flat colonies on rock surfaces. The thallus is typically yellowish to orange in color, and it lacks a distinct medulla, with a thin, cellular cortex. Calyptraria species are commonly found in temperate and subtropical regions, growing on calcareous substrates. They are important indicators of air quality due to their sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
