    "intro": "Calucechinus montagnei, commonly known as the Montagne's calucechinus, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Calyceraceae family. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant thrives in specific tropical and subtropical habitats, often in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are usually ovate with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
