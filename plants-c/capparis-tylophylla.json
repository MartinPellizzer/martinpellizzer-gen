    "intro": "Capparis tylophylla, commonly known as the coastal caper, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, often prickly stems and leaves that are typically narrow and fleshy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, citrus-scented fruits. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to saline environments. Its ability to withstand coastal conditions makes it an important plant in coastal ecosystems."
