It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark brown bark that resembles cinnamon. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers and oval-shaped berries that contain shiny, black seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique aroma and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
