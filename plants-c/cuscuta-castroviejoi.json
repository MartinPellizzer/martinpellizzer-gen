    "intro": "Cuscuta castroviejoi, commonly known as the Castroviejo dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrition. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through fragmentation of the plant. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and native vegetation."
