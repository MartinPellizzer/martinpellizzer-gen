    "intro": "Cynodon lemfuensis, commonly known as the Natal grass or lemfu grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Cynodon lemfuensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
