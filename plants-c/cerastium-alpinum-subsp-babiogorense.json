    "intro": "Cerastium alpinum subsp. babiogorense, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a dense layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh alpine environments. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, often found in high-altitude meadows and slopes."
