    "intro": "Calanthe beleensis, commonly known as the Bornean calanthe, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit and pseudobulbs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in a raceme. Its leaves are usually broad and lanceolate, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat. Calanthe beleensis is often found growing in shaded, moist environments, such as along stream banks or in dense undergrowth."
