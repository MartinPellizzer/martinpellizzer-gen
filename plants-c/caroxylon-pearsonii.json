    "intro": "Caroxylon pearsonii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with small, gray-green leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its structure is characterized by woody stems and a compact growth habit. Caroxylon pearsonii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
