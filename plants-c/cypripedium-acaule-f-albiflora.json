    "intro": "Cypripedium acaule f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy white petals and a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollination mechanism. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest floors, thriving in acidic soils. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a unique ornamental value to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
