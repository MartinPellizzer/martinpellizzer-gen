    "intro": "Chelonanthus fruticosus, commonly known as the shrub willow, is a deciduous shrub native to temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features slender, often branching stems covered in fine, silky hairs. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptical, and have a soft, velvety texture with a pale underside. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks."
