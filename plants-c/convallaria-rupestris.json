    "intro": "Convallaria rupestris, commonly known as the rock lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky soils and alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a dense rosette at the base. Convallaria rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
