    "intro": "Carex obtusata f. spicata, commonly known as the spicate sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces upright, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to brown in color. The plant prefers moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and often have a slightly rough texture. It is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
