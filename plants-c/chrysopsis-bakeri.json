    "intro": "Chrysopsis bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, seed-like fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
