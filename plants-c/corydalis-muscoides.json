    "intro": "Corydalis muscoides, commonly known as the musk root or musk corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its name is derived from the musky scent emitted by its roots, which has been historically used in traditional medicine."
