    "intro": "Cyperus diloloensis, commonly known as the African bulbous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant features a rhizomatous root system and produces dense clusters of small, grass-like leaves. Its flowering stems bear spikes of tiny, pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Cyperus diloloensis is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive, compact growth habit and ability to tolerate wet conditions."
