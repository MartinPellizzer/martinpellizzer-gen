    "intro": "Codon schenckii, commonly known as the Schenck's codon, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Codon schenckii is considered a species of conservation concern."
