    "intro": "Campanula mollis f. transiens, commonly known as the Transient Bellflower, is a hybrid form of the Campanula mollis species. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The flowers are usually blue to violet in color, with a delicate, bell-like appearance that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. This cultivar is noted for its shorter flowering period compared to the species, hence its name \"transiens,\" which means transient or fleeting."
