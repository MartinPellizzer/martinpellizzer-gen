    "intro": "Cyrtopodium andersonii var. cardiochilum, commonly known as the Heart-lipped Cypripedium, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive heart-shaped lip, which is a key feature in its classification. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats, often in cloud forests or mountainous areas. Its botanical structure includes a pseudobulb that supports its growth, and it produces a single, fragrant bloom each year. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
