    "intro": "Clompanus cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf clompanus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically deep green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
