    "intro": "Crocus vittatus, commonly known as the violet crocus, is a species of flowering plant in the Iridaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in rocky soils and open habitats. The plant produces delicate, violet-colored flowers with three petals and three sepals, typically blooming in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted for storage and dormancy, allowing it to survive harsh winters. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging after the flowers have faded."
