    "intro": "Cereus californicus, commonly known as the California night-blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial plant that produces striking white flowers that open at night and remain open for only one night. The plant has a tall, spindly stem with prominent areoles, from which both spines and flowers emerge. Its flowers are typically fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water efficiently."
