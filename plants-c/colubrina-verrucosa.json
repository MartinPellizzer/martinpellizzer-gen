    "intro": "Colubrina verrucosa, commonly known as rough colubrina, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and coastal areas. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough or hairy texture, contributing to its common name. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in the plant's propagation."
