    "intro": "Conchocarpus oppositifolius, commonly known as the red mangrove or *Rhizophora mucronata*, is a species of mangrove tree native to tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive prop roots that extend into the water, aiding in stabilization and oxygen absorption. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its leaves are opposite in arrangement and have a leathery texture, adapted to withstand saltwater spray. This plant plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial life."
