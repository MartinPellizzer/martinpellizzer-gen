    "intro": "Carduus squarrosus, commonly known as the rough hawksbeard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has deeply lobed, serrated leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
