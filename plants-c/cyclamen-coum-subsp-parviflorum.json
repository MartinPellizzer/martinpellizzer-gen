    "intro": "Cyclamen coum subsp. parviflorum, commonly known as the Persian cyclamen, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers with prominent purple markings. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often grown as a decorative houseplant. Its tuberous roots allow it to survive periods of dormancy, making it well-suited for indoor cultivation. Cyclamen coum subsp. parviflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom throughout the winter months."
