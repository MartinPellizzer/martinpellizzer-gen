    "intro": "Cypripedium epidendricum, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy purple and white petals and a distinctive, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest floors and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its intricate and delicate floral structure. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its native range."
