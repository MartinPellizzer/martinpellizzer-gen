It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a delicate, fern-like appearance, and it produces small, yellow flowers in early spring. Its roots are fibrous, and the plant is often found in calcareous soils. Cardamine mariae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage."
