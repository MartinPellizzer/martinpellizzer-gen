    "intro": "Cerastium indicum var. ruwenzoriense, commonly known as the Ruwenzori mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
