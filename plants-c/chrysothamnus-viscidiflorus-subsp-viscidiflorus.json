    "intro": "Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus subsp. viscidiflorus, commonly known as sticky goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and sticky, glandular leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and cliffs. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and produces small, daisy-like blooms. Its foliage is often covered in fine, sticky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments."
