    "intro": "Crocus ochroleucus, commonly known as the yellow crocus, is a species of flowering plant in the Iridaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, typically growing in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange, often appearing in early spring. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous underground stem. The yellow crocus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit."
