    "intro": "Crocus speciosus subsp. ibrahimii, commonly known as the Ibrahim's crocus, is a rare and striking member of the Iridaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and is native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a period of cold dormancy to bloom successfully. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and endangered species."
