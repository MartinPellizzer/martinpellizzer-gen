    "intro": "Celsia valentina, commonly known as the Valentine's celsia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Celastraceae family and is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late winter, producing vibrant pink and white petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its unique morphology and seasonal blooming pattern make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to climate change, Celsia valentina is considered an endangered species."
