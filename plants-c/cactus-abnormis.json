    "intro": "Cactus abnormis, commonly known as the twisted cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its unusual, spiraling stems that twist upward, forming a distinctive, almost sculptural appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Cactus abnormis is well adapted to low-nutrient soils and can thrive with minimal rainfall."
