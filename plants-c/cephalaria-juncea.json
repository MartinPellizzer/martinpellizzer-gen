It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture. Cephalaria juncea is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
