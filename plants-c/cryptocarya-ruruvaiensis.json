    "intro": "Cryptocarya ruruvaiensis, commonly known as the Ruruvai cryptomeria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly found in parts of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and aromatic leaves, which emit a distinctive scent when crushed. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by oval-shaped berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species within its native range."
