    "intro": "Crescentia alata, commonly known as the \"chocolate apple\" or \"sweet sapote,\" is a tropical plant native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is a small evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy yellow flowers. The fruit is pear-shaped, with a thick, inedible rind and a sweet, creamy pulp that contains a single large seed. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its unique botanical features make it both ornamental and valuable for its edible fruit."
