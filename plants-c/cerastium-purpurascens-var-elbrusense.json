    "intro": "Cerastium purpurascens var. elbrusense, commonly known as the Elbrus mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Caucasus region. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant features hairy, ovate leaves that are often reddish in color, especially when exposed to full sun. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat."
