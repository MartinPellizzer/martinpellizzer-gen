    "intro": "Cupania spinosa, commonly known as the prickly soapberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with serrated edges and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces berries that start green and mature to a dark purple or black color, often containing seeds enclosed in a fleshy pulp. Its thorny branches and attractive foliage make it a notable species in its native habitat. Cupania spinosa is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
