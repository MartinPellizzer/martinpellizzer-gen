It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in a single head, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Carlina acaulis var. alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in high-altitude conditions."
