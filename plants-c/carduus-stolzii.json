It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. It has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
