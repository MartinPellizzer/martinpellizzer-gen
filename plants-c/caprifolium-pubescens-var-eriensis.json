    "intro": "Caprifolium pubescens var. eriensis, commonly known as the coastal honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and cliffs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
