    "intro": "Croixia gigantifolia, commonly known as the giant white hellebore, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its large, waxy, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green and often have a velvety texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
