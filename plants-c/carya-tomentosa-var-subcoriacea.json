    "intro": "Carya tomentosa var. subcoriacea, commonly known as the burr oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, ridged bark and large, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces oval, spiny acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its deep root system makes it highly drought-resistant and suitable for a variety of soil types. The plant is also valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in ecological restoration projects."
