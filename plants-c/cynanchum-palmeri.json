    "intro": "Cynanchum palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Cynanchum palmeri is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats."
