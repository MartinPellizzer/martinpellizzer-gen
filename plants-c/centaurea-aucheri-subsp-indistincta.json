It features upright, branching stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with blue to purple petals and yellow centers, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. It is well-suited for rock gardens and dry soils due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
