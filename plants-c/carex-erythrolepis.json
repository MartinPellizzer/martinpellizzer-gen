    "intro": "Carex erythrolepis, commonly known as the red-veined sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. The red veins on its leaves give it a distinctive appearance, making it a popular choice for wetland restoration and ornamental gardening."
