    "intro": "Cephalanthera raymondiae, commonly known as Raymond's lady's tresses, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its long, spiraled inflorescence of pale green to white flowers. The plant is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is essential for its survival. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in several states."
