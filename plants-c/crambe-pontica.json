    "intro": "Crambe pontica, commonly known as the Pontic crambe, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with erect stems and alternate, pinnately lobed leaves. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom in the summer months. The seeds of Crambe pontica are encased in a hard, woody capsule, which aids in their dispersal."
