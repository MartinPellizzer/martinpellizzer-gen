It features slender, grass-like stems that often grow in dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically purple or reddish in color, giving it its common name. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond edges, and is often found in disturbed soils. Cyperus spectabilis var. multiflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in water garden settings."
