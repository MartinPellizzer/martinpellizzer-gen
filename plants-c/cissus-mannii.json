    "intro": "Cissus mannii, commonly known as the African snow vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical and southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, white, star-shaped glands. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fleshy berries that are yellow when ripe. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Cissus mannii is also valued as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and vigorous growth habit."
