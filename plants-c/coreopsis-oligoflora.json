    "intro": "Coreopsis oligoflora, commonly known as the narrowleaf coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes and along stream banks. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with dark red centers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. Coreopsis oligoflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
