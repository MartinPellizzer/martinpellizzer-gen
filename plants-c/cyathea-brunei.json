    "intro": "Cyathea brunei, commonly known as the Brunei tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant is typically found in humid, tropical rainforests, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizome system allows it to anchor itself firmly in the soil while absorbing nutrients. Cyathea brunei plays an important ecological role in its habitat, contributing to forest biodiversity and soil stability."
