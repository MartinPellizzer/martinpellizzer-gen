    "intro": "Cypripedium warszewiczianum, commonly known as the Warszewicz's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the forests of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a unique feature among orchids. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are usually broad and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
