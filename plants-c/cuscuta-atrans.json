    "intro": "Cuscuta atrans, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive network of slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is found in various regions across North America and is often seen growing on crops like corn and soybeans. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and agricultural machinery, contributing to its widespread distribution. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
