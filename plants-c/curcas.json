    "intro": "Curcas, commonly known as the Chinese lantern or physalis, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It produces distinctive lantern-shaped fruits that enclose its seeds, often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves and can grow up to 2 meters tall. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The fruit's thick, papery husk dries to a vibrant orange or red color, making it a popular choice for dried decorations."
