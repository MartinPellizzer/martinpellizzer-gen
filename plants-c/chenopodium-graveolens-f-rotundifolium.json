    "intro": "Chenopodium graveolens f. rotundifolium, commonly known as roundleaf lambsquarters, is a variant of the common lambsquarters species. It is a herbaceous annual plant native to temperate regions of the Americas. The plant features broad, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
