    "intro": "Centropogon solanifolius var. hirtellus, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, violet to purple flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. The fruit is a small, berry-like structure that ripens to a dark purple or black color, often containing several seeds."
