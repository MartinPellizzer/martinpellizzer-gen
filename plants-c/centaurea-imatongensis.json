    "intro": "Centaurea imatongensis, commonly known as the Imatong bluebottle, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of South Sudan. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flower heads, which are surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower structure. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
