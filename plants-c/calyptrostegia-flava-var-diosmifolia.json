    "intro": "Calyptrostegia flava var. diosmifolia, commonly known as the yellow sandalwood, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Lauraceae. It is characterized by its aromatic, yellowish wood and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with smooth, fissured bark and opposite, ovate leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with a sweet scent, and it produces drupes that are important for local wildlife. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
