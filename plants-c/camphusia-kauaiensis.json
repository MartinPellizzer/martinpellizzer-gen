    "intro": "Camphusia kauaiensis, commonly known as Kauai's camphor tree, is a unique species native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It is a member of the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, camphor-like scent. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane forests. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
