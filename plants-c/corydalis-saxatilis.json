It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features slender, branched stems and small, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often resembling orchids. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and slightly hairy, contributing to its rugged appearance. Corydalis saxatilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
