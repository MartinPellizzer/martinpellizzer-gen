    "intro": "Chaenomeles \u00d7 superba f. rosea, commonly known as the roseflowered Japanese quince, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is a hybrid species within the genus Chaenomeles, characterized by its ornamental value and hardy nature. The plant produces showy, rose-like flowers in shades of pink to red, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruit, a fleshy, yellowish pome, is edible but less commonly cultivated for consumption. This variety is prized for its winter hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
