    "intro": "Cogylia, commonly known as the common cogon grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks and long, narrow leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically green or brown in color. Cogylia is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it both a useful forage plant and an invasive weed. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to warm climates and disturbed environments."
