    "intro": "Carex flacca subvar. cuspidata, commonly known as the sharp-tipped sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often reddish or purple at the base, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
