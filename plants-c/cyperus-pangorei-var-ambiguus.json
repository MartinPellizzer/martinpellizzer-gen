    "intro": "Cyperus pangorei var. ambiguus, commonly known as the swamp cyperus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually wind-pollinated, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively. Cyperus pangorei var. ambiguus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
