    "intro": "Cactus peruvianus var. monstruosus, commonly known as the Peruvian giant cactus, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the Andes Mountains of Peru. It is characterized by its massive, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height, often with a ribbed or fluted appearance. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the summer months. It thrives in arid to semi-arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for collectors and botanical gardens."
