    "intro": "Crepis flexiscapa, commonly known as the bent bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with slender, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a common indicator plant in wetland habitats."
