    "intro": "Casearia moaensis, commonly known as the Maori casearia, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii. It belongs to the family Salicaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
