    "intro": "Cologania angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cologania, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a pointed tip. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its foliage is aromatic, with a slight mint-like scent, and it is often found in dry, rocky soils. Cologania angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
