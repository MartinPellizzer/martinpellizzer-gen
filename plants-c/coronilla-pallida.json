    "intro": "Coronilla pallida, commonly known as the pale crownvetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It has a creeping growth habit with extensive root systems, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
