    "intro": "Cacalia tigrensis, commonly known as the Trinidad bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Trinidad. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its striking blue to purple flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Cacalia tigrensis is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions."
