It features thick, fleshy rhizomes and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a sticky, milky sap. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by oval, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
