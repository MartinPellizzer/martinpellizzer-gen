    "intro": "Cheirolophus pinnatifidus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking blue or purple bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean climates."
