    "intro": "Chamaeraphis brachiariiformis, commonly known as the sea fennel, is a flowering plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as coastal areas and salt marshes. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, triangular seeds. This species plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity."
