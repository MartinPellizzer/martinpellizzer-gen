    "intro": "Capnophyllum lutzeyeri, commonly known as the Lutzey's capillary plant, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive strategy relies on wind pollination, and it produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by air. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Capnophyllum lutzeyeri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
