    "intro": "Cuscuta gymnocarpa, commonly known as the naked-seeded dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, yellow-orange stem covered in tiny, scale-like structures. The plant's seeds are enclosed in a smooth, capsule-like structure, which is a distinguishing feature of its reproductive system. It is native to various regions of the world, including parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and other plants it infests."
