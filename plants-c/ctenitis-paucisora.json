    "intro": "Ctenitis paucisora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, narrow fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of whitish\u8338\u6bdb. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates in humid, shaded environments, thriving in the understory of tropical forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in distinctive patterns. Ctenitis paucisora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
