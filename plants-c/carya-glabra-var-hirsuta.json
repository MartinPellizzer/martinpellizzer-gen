    "intro": "Carya glabra var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hirsute hickory, is a variant of the bitternut hickory. It is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, characterized by its rough, hairy texture on its bark and leaves. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, often turning yellow in the fall. Its fruit is a spiny, oval nut enclosed in a thick, woody husk. This plant is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
