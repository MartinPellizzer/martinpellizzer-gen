    "intro": "Carex nigra f. bina, commonly known as the black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and pond margins. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in wetland environments. The inflorescence consists of two distinct spikelets, which is a distinguishing feature of this particular form."
