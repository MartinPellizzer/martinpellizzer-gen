    "intro": "Crataegus pycnoloba, commonly known as the dense-fruited hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, featuring thorny branches and oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in spring, followed by red to orange berries in the fall. Its fruits are an important food source for birds and wildlife, and the plant is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its cardiovascular benefits. The dense, compact growth habit of Crataegus pycnoloba makes it a hardy and ornamental plant suitable for various garden settings."
