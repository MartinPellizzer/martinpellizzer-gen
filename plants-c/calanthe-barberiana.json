    "intro": "Calanthe barberiana, commonly known as the barber's calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest floors, thriving in rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate beauty to its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
