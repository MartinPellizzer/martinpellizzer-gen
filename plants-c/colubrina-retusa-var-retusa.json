    "intro": "Colubrina retusa var. retusa, commonly known as silky colubrina, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically silver-green in color and have a soft, silky texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in the spring. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. Silky colubrina is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
