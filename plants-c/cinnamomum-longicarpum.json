    "intro": "Cinnamomum longicarpum, commonly known as wild cinnamon or Malabar cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of southern India and Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark reddish-brown bark, which is often used in traditional medicine and as a spice. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers and oblong, dark purple berries that contain the seeds. Its leaves are lance-shaped, glossy, and have a strong, camphor-like scent. The tree is valued for its essential oils, which are used in perfumery, aromatherapy, and as a natural insect repellent."
