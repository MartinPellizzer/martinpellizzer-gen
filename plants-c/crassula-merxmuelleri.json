It features compact, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with a striking blue or purple hue, especially in cooler conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink during the spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
