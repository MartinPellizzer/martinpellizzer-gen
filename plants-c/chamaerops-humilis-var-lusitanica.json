    "intro": "Chamaerops humilis var. lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian fan palm, is a compact, cold-hardy palm native to southern Europe. It features a short, sturdy trunk and a dense crown of feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive, fan-shaped appearance. This variety thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its slow growth rate and ornamental value make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The plant is also valued for its ability to tolerate coastal conditions and urban environments."
