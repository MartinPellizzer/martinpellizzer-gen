    "intro": "Crudia oblonga, commonly known as the oblong leaf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically oval or oblong in shape, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, which are followed by distinctive seed capsules. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
