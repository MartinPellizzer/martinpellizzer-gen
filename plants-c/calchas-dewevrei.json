    "intro": "Calchas dewevrei, commonly known as the Dewevre's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that display a range of colors, typically white or pale pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in arid or seasonal environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the soil efficiently, and it often thrives in shaded, moist habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Calchas dewevrei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
