    "intro": "Crassula subulata var. hispida, commonly known as the hispid crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the warmer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
