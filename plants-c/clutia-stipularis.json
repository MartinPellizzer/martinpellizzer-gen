    "intro": "Clutia stipularis, commonly known as the creeping clutia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a low shrub or vine, with opposite leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive stipule at the base of each leaf pair. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Clutia stipularis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
