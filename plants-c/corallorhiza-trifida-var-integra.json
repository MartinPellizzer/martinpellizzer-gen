    "intro": "Corallorhiza trifida var. integra, commonly known as the showy coralroot, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph. This plant relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in association with hardwood trees. The plant produces striking, clustered inflorescences of pink to red flowers, which are showy but lack petals. Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
