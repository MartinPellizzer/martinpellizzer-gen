    "intro": "Colymbada sylvatica, commonly known as the European marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in marshes, bogs, and other moist environments, thriving in nutrient-poor soils. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it in waterlogged ground, while its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Colymbada sylvatica plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems."
