    "intro": "Crataegus furtiva, commonly known as the creeping hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with multiple stems forming a dense mat or bush. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by red berries in the autumn. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it often thrives in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Crataegus furtiva is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance, providing food for birds and insects."
