    "intro": "Chrysosplenium alternifolium var. virescens, commonly known as the greenleaf water avens, is a low-growing perennial herb native to moist woodland habitats in North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with rhizomatous stems that spread horizontally through the soil. The plant produces small, showy white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its alternate, ovate leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its aesthetic appeal in shaded garden settings."
