    "intro": "Crusea coccinea var. pubescens, commonly known as the showy cranesbill, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features upright stems covered in soft, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive pubescent appearance. The plant produces striking red or pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on tall, sturdy spikes. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a hairy underside, and it thrives in well-drained, fertile soils. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
