    "intro": "Calanthe gougahensis, commonly known as the Gougahensis orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer, are usually white or pale pink with intricate patterns. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Calanthe gougahensis is considered a threatened species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
