    "intro": "Cryptantha texana, commonly known as the Texas cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Cryptantha texana is often found in open plains and along rocky slopes, where it thrives in full sun."
