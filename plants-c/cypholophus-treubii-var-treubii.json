    "intro": "Cypholophus treubii var. treubii, commonly known as the slender leaf fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and often covered in a layer of fine, white mycorrhizal fungi. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, clustered sori on the underside of the leaves."
