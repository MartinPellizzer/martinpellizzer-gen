    "intro": "Cardamine bergeriana, commonly known as the Berger's watercress, is a small herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous plants. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and rocky crevices. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately divided, and often have a peppery flavor due to the presence of glucosinolates. The small white flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees."
