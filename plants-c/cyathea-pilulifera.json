    "intro": "Cyathea pilulifera, commonly known as the pilule fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. Cyathea pilulifera thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its slow growth and unique appearance make it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
