It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 feet and features thorned branches, which are a characteristic feature of the Crataegus genus. The plant produces white to pink flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. The Colorado hawthorn is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
