It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It is a succulent plant, adapted to arid environments with thick, fleshy stems that store water. The spines are usually short and sparse, providing some protection from herbivores."
