It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. The plant is native to Central Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated but can become invasive in certain regions."
