    "intro": "Calyptranthes lepida, commonly known as the silverleaf calyptranthes, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. These flowers are followed by small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Calyptranthes lepida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils with partial shade."
