    "intro": "Cactus fragilis, commonly known as the brittle cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that are covered in small, white spines for protection. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its stems to survive in dry conditions. Cactus fragilis is well adapted to extreme heat and low precipitation, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
