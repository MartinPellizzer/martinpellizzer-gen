    "intro": "Carex hirtissima, commonly known as the hairy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often hairy, especially along the edges. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers in the summer, which are typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Carex hirtissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
