    "intro": "Cactus echinata, commonly known as the spiny cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny exterior. Its spines, which are modified leaves, provide protection against herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration. Cactus echinata is often used in traditional medicine and is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
