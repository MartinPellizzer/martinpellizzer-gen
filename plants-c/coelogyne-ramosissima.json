    "intro": "Coelogyne ramosissima, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant has a pseudobulb structure with fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are thick and help it cling to trees, while its rhizomes allow for vegetative propagation. Coelogyne ramosissima is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
