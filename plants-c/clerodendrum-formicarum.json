    "intro": "Clerodendrum formicarum, commonly known as the ant plant, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive reddish or purple underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by ornamental, bead-like fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its unique ability to attract ants for protection is a notable botanical feature."
