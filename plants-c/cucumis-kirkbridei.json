    "intro": "Cucumis kirkbridei, commonly known as the Chihuahuan prickly pear cucumber, is a rare and unique species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and melons. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and small, green, cucumber-like fruits that mature to a yellowish-orange color. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and has adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
