    "intro": "Carex semihyalofructa, commonly known as the semi-translucent fruit sedge, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color, with a dense, compact growth form. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are often hidden within the foliage. Its reproductive structures, known as achenes, are enclosed in a perigynium, a unique feature common to many sedges. Carex semihyalofructa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats."
