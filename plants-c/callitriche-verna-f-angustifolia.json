    "intro": "Callitriche verna f. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf water starwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is a submerged aquatic plant characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are narrow and often arranged in whorls around the stem, while the flowers are borne in clusters at the water's surface. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Callitriche verna."
