    "intro": "Cheilanthes lendigera var. minor, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species for xerophytic environments. Its spore-bearing structures, known as sori, are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is noted for its resilience and is often found in crevices and on rock faces where it can retain moisture effectively."
