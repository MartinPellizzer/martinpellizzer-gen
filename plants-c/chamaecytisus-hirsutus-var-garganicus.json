    "intro": "Chamaecytisus hirsutus var. garganicus, commonly known as the Garganica broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its hirsute appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
