    "intro": "Carex fasciculata, commonly known as narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial grass-like plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Carex fasciculata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability."
