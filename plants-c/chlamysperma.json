    "intro": "Chlamysperma, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking, spiky flowers that resemble sea urchins, often in shades of blue, purple, or white. The plants are typically shrubs or subshrubs, with woody stems and narrow, leathery leaves. Native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean, they thrive in saline and well-drained soils. Chlamysperma species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
