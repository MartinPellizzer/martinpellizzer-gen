    "intro": "Coursetia ochroleuca, commonly known as the yellowleaf coursetia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellowish-green leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought and heat. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Coursetia ochroleuca is part of the Amaranthaceae family and is known for its hardy nature in xerophytic conditions."
