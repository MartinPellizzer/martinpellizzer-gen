    "intro": "Ctenitis umbrina, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its rhizomes are typically short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the soil. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid, tropical climates."
