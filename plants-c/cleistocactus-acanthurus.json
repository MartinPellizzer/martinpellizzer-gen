    "intro": "Cleistocactus acanthurus, commonly known as the golden crown cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive golden-yellow coloration that becomes more pronounced with age. The plant features a single stem that can grow up to several meters tall, covered in spiny areoles. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, opening at night and attracting nocturnal pollinators. Due to its striking appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
