    "intro": "Crotalaria craspedocarpa, commonly known as the spiked crownflower, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features hairy, branched stems and palmate leaves with three to five lobes. The plant produces distinctive yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, with spurred petals that resemble tiny horns. Its seeds are enclosed in inflated, three-lobed pods that split open when mature. Crotalaria craspedocarpa is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
