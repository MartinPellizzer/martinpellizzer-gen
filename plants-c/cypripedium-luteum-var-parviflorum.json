    "intro": "Cypripedium luteum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like flower that is typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome and grows in shaded, moist forest environments. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
