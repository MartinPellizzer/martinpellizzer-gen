    "intro": "Cyperus terminalis, commonly known as spike rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its cylindrical, spike-like inflorescence that bears small, three-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, making it an effective pioneer species in disturbed or flooded soils. Cyperus terminalis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
