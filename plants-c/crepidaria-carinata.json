    "intro": "Crepidaria carinata, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with dark green, leathery leaves that have a distinctive ridge or carina running down the center. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
