    "intro": "Cymodocea manatorum, commonly known as the manatee grass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico. It is a perennial aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, brackish or freshwater environments. The plant has long, narrow leaves that form dense underwater mats, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or just at the water's surface. Cymodocea manatorum plays an important role in stabilizing sediments and supporting marine biodiversity."
