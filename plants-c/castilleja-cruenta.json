    "intro": "Castilleja cruenta, commonly known as the scarlet Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking red, brush-like inflorescence. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its root system from nearby host plants. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Castilleja cruenta plays a role in pollination and serves as a food source for certain insects and wildlife."
