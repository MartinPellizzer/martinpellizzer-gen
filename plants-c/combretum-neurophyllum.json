    "intro": "Combretum neurophyllum, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits that split open to release small, flat seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. Its rapid growth and striking foliage make it a notable species in botanical gardens and landscapes."
