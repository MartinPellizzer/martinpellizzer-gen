    "intro": "Clematis teretipes, commonly known as the narrowleaf clematis, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets, often with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are slender and twining, allowing it to climb and support itself on structures. Clematis teretipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and fragrance."
