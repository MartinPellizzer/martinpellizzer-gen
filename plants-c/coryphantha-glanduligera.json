    "intro": "Coryphantha glanduligera, commonly known as the woolly golden cactus, is a species native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, stem-clad cactus with a distinctive appearance featuring short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly hair. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-gray foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Coryphantha glanduligera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness."
