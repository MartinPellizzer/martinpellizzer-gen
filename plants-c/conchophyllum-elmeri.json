    "intro": "Conchophyllum elmeri, commonly known as the Elmer's sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple, and its succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. Conchophyllum elmeri thrives in sandy soils near the shoreline and is often found in mangrove swamps or tidal zones. Its unique adaptations make it an important part of the coastal ecosystem, supporting various marine and terrestrial life forms."
