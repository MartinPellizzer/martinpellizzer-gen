    "intro": "Commiphora kua var. gowlello, commonly known as the Gowlello myrrh tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Burseraceae family. It is native to parts of East Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces a reddish-brown resin that has been traditionally used for medicinal and aromatic purposes. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of up to 5 meters. The resinous sap of Commiphora kua var. gowlello is similar to frankincense and myrrh, making it valuable in traditional medicine and incense-making."
