    "intro": "Coeloglossum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine tongue orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, erect stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
