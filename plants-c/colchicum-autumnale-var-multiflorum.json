    "intro": "Colchicum autumnale var. multiflorum, commonly known as the autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features striking purple to violet flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn, typically from August to October. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that emerge from a bulbous corm, which is its primary storage organ. Its flowers are arranged in clusters and are often mistaken for true crocuses, though it belongs to the Colchicaceae family. The plant contains toxic compounds, including colchicine, which makes it hazardous to both humans and animals."
