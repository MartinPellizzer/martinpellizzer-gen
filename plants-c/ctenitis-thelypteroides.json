It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its fronds with a distinctive, hairy texture on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are often divided into lance-shaped segments, and the sori are clustered on the undersides of the pinnae. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
