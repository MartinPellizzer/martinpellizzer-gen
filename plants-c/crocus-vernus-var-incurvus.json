    "intro": "Crocus vernus var. incurvus, commonly known as the bent-crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a distinctive curling petal at the base. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Its blooming period occurs in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The species is closely related to other crocus varieties and is valued for its ornamental beauty and early flowering habit."
