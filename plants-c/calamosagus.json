    "intro": "Calamosagus, commonly known as the giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to wetland areas in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It features long, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 4 meters in height, often forming dense stands in marshy or aquatic environments. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles. Calamosagus is adapted to waterlogged soils and can thrive in both freshwater and brackish habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to form extensive colonies make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
