    "intro": "Cheilanthes lerstenii, commonly known as the lersten's rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows on rocky outcrops and in arid environments. The plant has a compact rosette of leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery bloom. Its reproductive structures are borne on short, erect spore-bearing stalks, and it is well adapted to dry, nutrient-poor soils. This fern is often found in crevices and on limestone, showcasing its resilience to harsh conditions."
