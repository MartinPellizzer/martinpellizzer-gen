    "intro": "Carex alpina f. longipedunculata, commonly known as the Alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage. It features narrow, cylindrical leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences that are elongated, with the inflorescence axis being notably longer than in the typical form. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
