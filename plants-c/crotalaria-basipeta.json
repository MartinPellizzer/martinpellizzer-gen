    "intro": "Crotalaria basipeta, commonly known as the basipetal crotalaria, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in racemes, often with a striking contrast between the bright petals and the darker sepals. The plant has palmate leaves with three to five leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain areas."
