    "intro": "Cheilanthes parviloba, commonly known as the small-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Cheilanthes parviloba is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that is well adapted to harsh, sun-exposed conditions."
