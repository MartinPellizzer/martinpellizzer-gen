    "intro": "Cytisus striatus subsp. eriocarpus, commonly known as the hairy broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, and it is adapted to grow in well-drained, often calcareous soils. It is often found in open habitats such as scrublands and forest edges."
