    "intro": "Carex clandestina, commonly known as the hidden sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in dense spikes, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds. Carex clandestina is often found in shaded, nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
