    "intro": "Cynometra palustris, commonly known as the swamp tamarind, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The tree has smooth, gray bark and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, and the plant is valued for its hard, durable wood. Cynometra palustris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
