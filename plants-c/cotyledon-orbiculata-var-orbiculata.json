It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with red or purple markings. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are adapted to store water, making it highly drought-tolerant. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
