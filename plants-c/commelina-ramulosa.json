    "intro": "Commelina ramulosa, commonly known as the slender commelina, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Commelinaceae and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers with three petals and three sepals, often clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed."
