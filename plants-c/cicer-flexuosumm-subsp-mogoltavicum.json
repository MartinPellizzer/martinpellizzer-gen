    "intro": "[WRONG START] Cicer flexuosum subsp. mogoltavicum, commonly known as the Mogoltavian vetch, is a rare subspecies native to specific regions in the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry riverbeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being narrow and slightly hairy. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential adaptations to harsh environmental conditions."
