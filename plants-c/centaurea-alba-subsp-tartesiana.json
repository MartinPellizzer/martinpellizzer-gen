    "intro": "Centaurea alba subsp. tartesiana, commonly known as the white centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its flowers are pale blue to white, with prominent yellow central discs, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn. The subspecies tartesiana is distinguished by its slightly larger flowers and more robust growth compared to the typical form of Centaurea alba."
