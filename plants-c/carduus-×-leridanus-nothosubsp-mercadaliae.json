    "intro": "Carduus \u00d7 leridanus nothosubsp. mercadaliae, commonly known as the mercadalia thistle, is a hybrid plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial species that can form dense stands, making it both a weed and a potential indicator of soil disturbance. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on hybridization and ecological adaptation."
