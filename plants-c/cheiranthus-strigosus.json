    "intro": "Cheiranthus strigosus, commonly known as the hairy rocket or winter flowering wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found along walls or in dry habitats. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cheiranthus strigosus blooms in winter and early spring, making it one of the first flowering plants to appear in its native environment."
