    "intro": "Cybianthus hoehnei, commonly known as the Hoehne's cybianthus, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cybianthus hoehnei is typically found in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
