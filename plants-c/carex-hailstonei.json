    "intro": "Carex hailstonei, commonly known as the Hailstone sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in hue. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Carex hailstonei is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
