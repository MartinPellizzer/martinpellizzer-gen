    "intro": "Cyathocline manilaliana, commonly known as the Manilaliana Cyathocline, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific tropical regions. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a cup-like involucrum that encloses the reproductive organs. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in mountainous or forested areas. Its leaves are usually broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
