    "intro": "Carduus kerneri subsp. lobulatiformis, commonly known as the lobed thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust stem covered in dense, spiny leaves that are typically lobed or toothed. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences topped with purple to pinkish composite flowers. Its leaves are often covered in a white, powdery coating called bloom, which helps reduce water loss. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
