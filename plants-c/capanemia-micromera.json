    "intro": "Capanemia micromera, commonly known as the dwarf capanemia, is a small herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks or in dense undergrowth. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
