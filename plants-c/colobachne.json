These plants are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in wetland or marshy environments. Colobachne species are characterized by their slender, grass-like foliage and small, clustered inflorescences. They play a role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for various small organisms. Some species are used in traditional medicine or as forage for livestock."
