    "intro": "Calluna sagittifolia var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. The leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its \"hirsuta\" designation. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
