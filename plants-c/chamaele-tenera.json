    "intro": "Chamaele tenera, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture. Chamaele tenera is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
