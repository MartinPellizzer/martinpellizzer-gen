    "intro": "Cuscuta globulosa, commonly known as the globular dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, round, yellowish-orange seeds that are dispersed by wind, animals, or water. The plant has a vine-like structure with numerous small, thread-like stems that attach to host plants using specialized sucking organs. It is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host, sometimes leading to reduced growth or even death."
