    "intro": "Cycnoches cucullatum, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, hood-like structure that encloses its flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests or high-altitude grasslands. Its blooms are usually small and fragrant, displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cycnoches cucullatum is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
