    "intro": "Chlamydacanthus rupestris, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with red or purple, and it produces small, yellow flowers clustered in umbels. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant coloration and drought tolerance."
