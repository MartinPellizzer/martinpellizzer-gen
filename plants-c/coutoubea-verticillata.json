    "intro": "Coutoubea verticillata, commonly known as the snowball bush, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring, creating a striking visual display. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its hardiness and showy blooms, it is often used in coastal landscapes where it can tolerate salt spray."
