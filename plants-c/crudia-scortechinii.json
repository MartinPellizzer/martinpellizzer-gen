    "intro": "Crudia scortechinii, commonly known as the Mediterranean holly-leaf tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree that typically grows in rocky soils and coastal areas. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red berries in the autumn. Its leaves are leathery and glossy, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
