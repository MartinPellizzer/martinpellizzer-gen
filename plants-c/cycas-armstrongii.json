    "intro": "Cycas armstrongii, commonly known as the Armstrong's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
