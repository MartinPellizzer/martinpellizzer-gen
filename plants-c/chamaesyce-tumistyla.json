    "intro": "Chamaesyce tumistyla, commonly known as the woolly sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides a protective layer against desert conditions. The plant typically has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, often in clusters at the ends of the stems. Chamaesyce tumistyla is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
