    "intro": "Convolvulus mechoacana, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that produces vibrant purple to blue flowers with five petals, typical of the Convolvulaceae family. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are heart-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, a trait that helps conserve moisture. The plant's fibrous roots allow it to thrive in poor soils, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
