It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, typically found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important subject for botanical study."
