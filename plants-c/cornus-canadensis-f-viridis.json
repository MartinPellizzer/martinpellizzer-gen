    "intro": "Cornus canadensis f. viridis, commonly known as the green-twigged dogwood, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It belongs to the Cornaceae family and is characterized by its slender, greenish-barked stems that remain throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its foliage is typically broad-ovate with a smooth margin, and it thrives in moist, acidic soils under partial to full shade. This variety is distinguished by its persistent, green twigs, which set it apart from the more common red- or yellow-twigged forms of Cornus canadensis."
