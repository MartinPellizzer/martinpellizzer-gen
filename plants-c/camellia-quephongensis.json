    "intro": "Camellia quephongensis, commonly known as the Que Phong camellia, is a rare and ornamental evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often with a contrasting central stripe. The plant produces elliptical, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking backdrop to its blooms. It thrives in shady, humid environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
