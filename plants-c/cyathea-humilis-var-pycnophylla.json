    "intro": "Cyathea humilis var. pycnophylla, commonly known as the dense-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves that give it a lush, tropical appearance. The fronds are typically dark green and have a dense, leathery texture, contributing to its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
