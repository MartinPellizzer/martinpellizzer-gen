    "intro": "Cyanea hamatiflora, commonly known as the Hawaiian sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has adapted to salt spray and sandy soils. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, often with a waxy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Cyanea hamatiflora plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small organisms."
