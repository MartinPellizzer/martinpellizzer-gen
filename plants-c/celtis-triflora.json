    "intro": "Celtis triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered hackberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, round berries that are edible for some wildlife. The plant is often found in moist woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
