    "intro": "Chamaesyce amoena, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Chamaesyce amoena is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
