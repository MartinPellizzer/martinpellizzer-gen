    "intro": "Commiphora habessinica var. simplicifolia, commonly known as the simple-leaved myrrh tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the Horn of Africa. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are borne in clusters, followed by fragrant, resinous sap that is used in traditional medicine and incense. It thrives in arid to semi-arid climates and is adapted to well-drained soils. The plant's unique botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and cultural contexts."
