    "intro": "Chaenomeles citripomma, commonly known as the Japanese flowering quince, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its thick, rugged bark and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are edible but often tart and not widely consumed. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant autumn foliage and winter interest."
