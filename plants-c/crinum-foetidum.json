    "intro": "Crinum foetidum, commonly known as the stinking lily, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pale purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves and produces a strong, unpleasant odor, which is thought to attract specific pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Crinum foetidum is a perennial herb that can grow up to several feet tall, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens."
