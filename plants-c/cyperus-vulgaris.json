    "intro": "Cyperus vulgaris, commonly known as spike rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, making it a common sight in wetlands and along water edges. Cyperus vulgaris is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can also serve as a natural indicator of soil moisture levels. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation in suitable habitats."
