    "intro": "Cyathea approximata, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of pinnate fronds that give it a lush, tropical appearance. Cyathea approximata reproduces via spores, which are released from the sporangia located on the underside of its fronds. This species is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
