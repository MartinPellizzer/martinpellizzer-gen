    "intro": "Cystopteris javensis, commonly known as the Java spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Cystopteris javensis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained, acidic soils."
