It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, cylindrical flower clusters. This plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, preferring moist soils and full sun to partial shade.

It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
