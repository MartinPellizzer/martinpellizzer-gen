It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, silver-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Cerinthe lamprocarpa is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
