    "intro": "Centaurea \u00d7 subdecurrens, commonly known as the hybrid cornflower, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant blue to purple flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. Its hybrid nature results from crosses between Centaurea cyanus and Centaurea micrantha, contributing to its genetic diversity and adaptability."
