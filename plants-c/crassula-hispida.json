    "intro": "Crassula hispida, commonly known as the woolly crassula, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features compact, fleshy leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the spring or early summer. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements. Crassula hispida thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
