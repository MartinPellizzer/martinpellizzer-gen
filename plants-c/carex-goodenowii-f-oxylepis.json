    "intro": "Carex goodenowii f. oxylepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedges, is a variant of the Carex genus characterized by its grass-like appearance and clumping growth habit. It typically features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green in color, with a slight sheen. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. This sedge is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse ecosystems."
