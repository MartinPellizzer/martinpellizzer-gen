    "intro": "Cornus corynostylis, commonly known as the narrowleaf dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage, showy flowers, and colorful fruit. Cornus corynostylis is often used in native plant gardens for its ecological benefits and visual appeal."
