    "intro": "Cordia lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cordia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy beneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fleshy, red or orange berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh conditions, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
