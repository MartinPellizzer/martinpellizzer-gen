    "intro": "Corchorus prismatocarpus, commonly known as the purple leaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, spiny capsules containing seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant's unique morphology and adaptability make it a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticultural studies."
