    "intro": "Colymbada chrysolepis, commonly known as the golden-leaved colymbada, is a striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often tinged with a golden hue, especially in full sun. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
