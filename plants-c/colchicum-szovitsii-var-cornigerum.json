    "intro": "Colchicum szovitsii var. cornigerum, commonly known as the Cornigerous Autumn Crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Colchicaceae and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are basal and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It produces distinctive, helmet-shaped seed capsules that contain numerous small, black seeds. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different floral morphology and growth habit compared to the typical form of Colchicum szovitsii."
