    "intro": "Cordiera rigida, commonly known as the rigid cordiera, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its woody stems and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are leathery and lance-shaped, providing a dense canopy that helps it thrive in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cordiera rigida is considered a conservation concern."
