    "intro": "Cephalophora decurrens, commonly known as the spreading rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant features a low-growing, spreading habit with basal leaves that are elongated and linear. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Cephalophora decurrens is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions."
