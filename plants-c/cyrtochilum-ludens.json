    "intro": "Cyrtochilum ludens, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in seasonal dry periods. Cyrtochilum ludens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
