    "intro": "Cordia leucomalla, commonly known as the white-flowered cordia, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and oval-shaped, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange to red fruits containing three to five seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
