    "intro": "Cirsium neglectum, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, serrated leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are covered in fine, prickly hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant is also known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in many environments."
