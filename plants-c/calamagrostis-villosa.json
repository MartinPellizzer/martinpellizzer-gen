    "intro": "Calamagrostis villosa, commonly known as silky grass or silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Eurasia. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically in late summer to early autumn. Its fibrous root system makes it adaptable to a variety of soil types and climates. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist environments."
