    "intro": "Cojoba donnell-smithii, commonly known as the Donnell-Smith's cojoba, is a rare and unique species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its flowers are typically pink or red, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cojoba donnell-smithii is considered a species of conservation concern."
