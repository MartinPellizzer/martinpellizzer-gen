    "intro": "Cissus granitica, commonly known as the granite vine, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by round, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Cissus granitica is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
