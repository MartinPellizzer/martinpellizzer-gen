    "intro": "Cotyledon canaliculata, commonly known as the wrinkled cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The leaves are typically gray-green with prominent veins and can develop a red or purple hue when exposed to sunlight. It produces small, yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange or red seed pods. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
