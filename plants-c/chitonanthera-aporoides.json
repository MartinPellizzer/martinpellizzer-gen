    "intro": "Chitonanthera aporoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with long, white, waxy petals and a single, elongated flower spike. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
