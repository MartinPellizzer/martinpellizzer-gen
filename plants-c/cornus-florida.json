    "intro": "Cornus florida, commonly known as the flowering dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its showy, white or pink bracts that surround small, yellowish flowers in the spring. The plant produces red or purple berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Its heart-shaped leaves provide attractive foliage throughout the growing season. Cornus florida is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and natural landscapes."
