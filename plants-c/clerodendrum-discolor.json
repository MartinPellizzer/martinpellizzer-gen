    "intro": "Clerodendrum discolor, commonly known as the white flame bush, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in summer. These flowers are followed by distinctive, velvety, purple-black berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Clerodendrum discolor is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
