    "intro": "Carex japonica var. aphanolepis, commonly known as Japanese sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually pale green to brown, flowering in late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a useful plant for erosion control."
