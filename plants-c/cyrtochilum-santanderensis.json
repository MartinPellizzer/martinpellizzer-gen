It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structure. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green, often with a distinctive lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, high-altitude climates of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
