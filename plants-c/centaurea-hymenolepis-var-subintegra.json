    "intro": "Centaurea hymenolepis var. subintegra, commonly known as the slender centaury, is a flowering plant species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense, spherical heads. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant typically grows in dry, rocky or gravelly soils. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is closely related to other centaury species and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
