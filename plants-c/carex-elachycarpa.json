It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its fruiting structures, called achenes, are small and three-angled, often with a short beak.
