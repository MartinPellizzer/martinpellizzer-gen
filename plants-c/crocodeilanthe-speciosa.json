    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe speciosa, commonly known as the dragon's tongue fern, is a rare and striking epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a distinctive, creeping rhizome system that allows it to anchor itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly sought after by botanists and collectors alike."
