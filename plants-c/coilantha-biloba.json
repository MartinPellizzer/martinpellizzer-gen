    "intro": "Coilantha biloba, commonly known as the spiral flower, is a unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its spirally arranged leaves and distinctive, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of violet and blue. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are succulent, allowing it to store water, which helps it survive in its high-altitude habitat. Coilantha biloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
