    "intro": "Chailletia subauriculata, commonly known as the auriculate chailletia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves with lobed margins and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
