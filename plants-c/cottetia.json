    "intro": "Cottetia, commonly known as the false lily of the valley, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Primulaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are herbaceous perennials native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have whorled leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Cottetia species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
