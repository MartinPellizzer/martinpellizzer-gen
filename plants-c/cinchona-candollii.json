    "intro": "Cinchona candollii, commonly known as the Bhutanese quinine tree, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is notable for its medicinal value, as it contains alkaloids similar to quinine, used historically in the treatment of malaria. It thrives in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
