It is characterized by its delicate, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Centaurea membranacea is also known for its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
