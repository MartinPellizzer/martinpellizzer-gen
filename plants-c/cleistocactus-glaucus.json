    "intro": "Cleistocactus glaucus, commonly known as the blue ghost cactus, is a species native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is a small, globular cactus with a bluish-gray appearance due to its dense covering of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that open only at night, a characteristic known as nocturnal anthesis. It is adapted to extreme aridity, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Cleistocactus glaucus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking appearance and unique blooming habit."
