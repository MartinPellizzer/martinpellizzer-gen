    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 paczoskii, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Carex brevicollis and Carex lyngbyei, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wetlands, and is native to parts of Europe. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Carex \u00d7 paczoskii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
