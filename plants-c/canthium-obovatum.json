It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and showy cyathium inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an erect annual herb with simple, alternate, and often ovate or elliptic-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves known as bracts. Canthium obovatum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and fields."
