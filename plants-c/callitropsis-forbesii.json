    "intro": "Callitropsis forbesii, commonly known as Forbes' juniper, is a species of evergreen shrub belonging to the family Cupressaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like cones. It is well adapted to harsh, rocky environments and is often found in high-altitude forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
