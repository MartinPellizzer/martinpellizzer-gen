    "intro": "Clusia neurophylla, commonly known as the waxleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, dark green leaves that are often used in ornamental horticulture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange or red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Clusia neurophylla is also known for its ability to tolerate partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
