It is characterized by its thick, waxy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage. Cissus pachyrrhachis is also valued for its ability to climb and its resilience to various environmental conditions."
