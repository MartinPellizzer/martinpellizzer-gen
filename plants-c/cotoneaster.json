It consists of approximately 300 species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Cotoneaster plants are characterized by their showy, often pink or white flowers that appear in clusters, followed by bright red or orange berries in the fall. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a serrated edge. These plants are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and adaptability to various garden conditions."
