    "intro": "Critamus heterophyllus, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves that change color with the seasons, often displaying vibrant red, orange, and yellow hues in autumn. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ecological and aesthetic purposes in horticulture."
