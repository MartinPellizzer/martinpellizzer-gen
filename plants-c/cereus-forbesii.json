    "intro": "Cereus forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. Cereus forbesii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming habit."
