    "intro": "Chamaeraphis italica var. rottleri, commonly known as the Italian sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in dry gardens."
