It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as coastal areas and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
