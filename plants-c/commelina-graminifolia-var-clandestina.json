    "intro": "Commelina graminifolia var. clandestina, commonly known as the hidden grass-leaf morning glory, is a striking member of the Commelinaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and vibrant blue-violet flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wet meadows. Its flowers have a unique structure with three petals and two sepals, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This variant is less commonly seen than other Commelina species, contributing to its name \"clandestina,\" which means secretive or hidden."
