    "intro": "Carex dicraea, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants commonly found in wet or moist environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a triangular cross-section, a characteristic feature of many sedges. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are clustered in a cylindrical inflorescence. Carex dicraea is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
