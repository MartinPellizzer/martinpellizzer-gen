    "intro": "Convolvulus hystrix subsp. inermis, commonly known as the smoothleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are smooth and glossy. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in the morning. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it both a desirable and potentially invasive species in certain environments."
