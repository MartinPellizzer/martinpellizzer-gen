    "intro": "Cassytha major, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true roots and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. The plant's stems are thread-like and can twine around host plants, often forming dense mats. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is commonly found in wetlands and disturbed soils. Cassytha major plays a role in ecological systems by influencing the growth of its host plants and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
