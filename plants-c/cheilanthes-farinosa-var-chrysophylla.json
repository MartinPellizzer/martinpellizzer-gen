    "intro": "Cheilanthes farinosa var. chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden frond rock fern, is a perennial fern species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with bright yellow to golden-green fronds that provide striking visual contrast. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is well adapted to drought conditions due to its succulent-like leaves. It reproduces via spores and is often found growing on limestone or sandstone outcrops. Its unique coloration and hardy nature make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
