    "intro": "Cereus grandiflorus var. speciosissimus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to produce large, showy flowers at night. The plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its flowers, which open in the evening, are typically white or pale pink and emit a subtle fragrance. The plant is also known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades."
