    "intro": "Cirsium setigerum, commonly known as hispid cocklebur, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny, rough-hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with toothed margins. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by spiky, spherical fruits. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including fields, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Due to its prickly nature, it is often considered a weed but also serves as a food source for certain wildlife."
