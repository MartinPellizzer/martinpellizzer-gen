    "intro": "Chamissoa maximiliani var. procumbens, commonly known as the creeping chamissoa, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, blue to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
