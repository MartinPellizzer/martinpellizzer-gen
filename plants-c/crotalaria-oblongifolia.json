    "intro": "Crotalaria oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its oblong, lance-shaped leaves and distinctive yellow flowers with a spurred structure. The plant produces pods that contain kidney-shaped seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Crotalaria oblongifolia is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant in agricultural systems. However, some species in the genus Crotalaria can be toxic to livestock, requiring caution in its cultivation and use."
