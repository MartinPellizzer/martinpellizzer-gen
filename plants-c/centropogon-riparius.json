    "intro": "Centropogon riparius, commonly known as the river orchid, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and riverine habitats of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and thrives in environments with ample sunlight. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged substrate, and it plays a role in stabilizing riverbanks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
