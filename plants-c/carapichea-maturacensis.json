    "intro": "Carapichea maturacensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, round berries. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in many regions."
