    "intro": "Cayratia triternata, commonly known as the three-parted cayratia, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
