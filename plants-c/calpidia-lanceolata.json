    "intro": "Calpidia lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf calpidia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hence the species name, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in umbels. Calpidia lanceolata is often found in wetlands and along streambanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for insects."
