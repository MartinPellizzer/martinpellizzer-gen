It features long, slender leaves that are typically bright green with a pale stripe running along the length of each leaf blade. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on slender stems, which are followed by delicate, three-lobed berries. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and minimal water requirements. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ease of care, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced gardeners."
