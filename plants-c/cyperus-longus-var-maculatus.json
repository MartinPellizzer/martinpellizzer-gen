    "intro": "Cyperus longus var. maculatus, commonly known as the spotted flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves with a distinctive purplish or reddish discoloration along the midribs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. Its ornamental value comes from its unique coloration and ability to add texture to aquatic or wetland landscapes."
