It typically grows in shallow water, often in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, opposite leaves that are usually submerged. It produces tiny white flowers that bloom in early spring, contributing to its ornamental value. This variety is distinguished by its rigid, upright growth habit compared to other forms of Callitriche verna."
