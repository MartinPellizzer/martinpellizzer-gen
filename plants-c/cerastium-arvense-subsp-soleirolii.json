    "intro": "Cerastium arvense subsp. soleirolii, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate habit and small, white flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and slopes, where it tolerates cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
