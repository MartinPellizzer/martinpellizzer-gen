    "intro": "Conostegia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered cypress, is a species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and humid lowland forests. The plant features narrow, scale-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its compact form and year-round foliage. Conostegia parviflora is also notable for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and tolerate salt spray, making it suitable for coastal landscaping."
