    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna var. inermis-compacta, commonly known as the compact form of the common hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and thornless stems, which distinguish it from other varieties of hawthorn. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in spring, followed by red berries in the fall. Its leaves are oval with serrated edges and a glossy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and is often used in hedgerows or as an ornamental plant due to its compact form and seasonal interest."
