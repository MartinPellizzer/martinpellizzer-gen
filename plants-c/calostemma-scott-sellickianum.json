    "intro": "Calostemma scott-sellickianum, commonly known as the Sellick's bellflower, is a rare and striking member of the Asparagaceae family. It is native to the western regions of South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape. The plant is characterized by its tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a contrasting purple or brown throat. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it grows in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
