    "intro": "Cordia harleyi, commonly known as the Harlequin tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its smooth, light green bark and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive orange to red, fleshy fruits. Cordia harleyi is adapted to coastal climates and is often found in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
