    "intro": "Cyclophyllum schultzii f. schultzii, commonly known as the Schultze's cyclophyllum, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squash, and is native to specific regions in South America. The plant exhibits a climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend support structures. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it produces small, edible fruits that are often overlooked in favor of more common cucurbit species."
