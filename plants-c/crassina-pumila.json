    "intro": "Crassina pumila, commonly known as the common sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy soils in temperate regions. It features a sprawling growth habit with numerous small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor and well-drained environments. Crassina pumila is often found in coastal dunes and other disturbed sandy habitats."
