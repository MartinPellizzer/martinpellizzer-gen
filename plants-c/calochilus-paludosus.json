    "intro": "Calochilus paludosus, commonly known as the swamp orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in wet or swampy habitats, often in heathland or coastal areas. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a single or few flowers that are usually pale green or yellowish in color. Its flowers have a distinct, intricate structure with three sepals and three petals, with the lateral petals often modified into showy, spurred shapes. Calochilus paludosus is known for its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other native flora in its habitat."
