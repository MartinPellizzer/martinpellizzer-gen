    "intro": "Castanea americana, commonly known as the American chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces spiny, spherical fruits called chestnuts, which contain one to three edible seeds. It was once a dominant species in eastern forests but was nearly wiped out by the chestnut blight in the early 20th century. Efforts are ongoing to restore its population through breeding programs and genetic resistance research."
