    "intro": "Cyperus bancanus var. brevibracteatus, commonly known as the narrow-bracted flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, thriving in areas with standing water. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid conditions. This variant is distinguished by its shorter bracts compared to other Cyperus species, contributing to its unique botanical identity."
