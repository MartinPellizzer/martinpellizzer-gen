    "intro": "Crataegus triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to ovate leaves, and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that appear in early spring. The flowers give way to red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and mammals. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full to partial sunlight. This plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
