    "intro": "Cardamomum nemorale, commonly known as the forest cardamom, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often hidden among the foliage. Its rhizomes, similar to those of ginger, are the primary part used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Cardamomum nemorale thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in dense forest understories."
