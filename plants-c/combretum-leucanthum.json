    "intro": "Combretum leucanthum, commonly known as the white-flowered combretum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often pubescent beneath. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
