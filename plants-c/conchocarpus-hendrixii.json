It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, woody fruits that resemble small, elongated capsules. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a rough, hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
