    "intro": "Cyclosorus papilionaceus, commonly known as the flying saucer liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, flat, disc-like thallus that resembles a flying saucer, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called soridia. Cyclosorus papilionaceus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
