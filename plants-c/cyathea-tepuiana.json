    "intro": "Cyathea tepuiana, commonly known as the Tepuian tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in favorable conditions. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky or nutrient-poor soils. The fronds are typically evergreen, providing a dense canopy that supports a variety of epiphytic organisms."
