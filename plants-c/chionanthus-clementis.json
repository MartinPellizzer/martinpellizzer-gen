    "intro": "Chionanthus clementis, commonly known as the Clement's fringeflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, providing a striking contrast to its delicate flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
