    "intro": "Cephalocereus hapalacanthus, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert of North America. It is a tall, columnar cactus with a thick, ribbed stem that can grow up to 20 meters in height. The plant features spiny areoles and produces large, white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. Its adaptations include a deep root system for water absorption and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant is also known for its slow growth and ability to survive in arid environments."
