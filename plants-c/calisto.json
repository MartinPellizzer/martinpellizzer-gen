    "intro": "Calisto, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its pale blue, almost translucent petals that resemble the color of the moon, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant has a short flowering period, typically blooming only once every few years, which makes it highly sought after by botanists and collectors. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Calisto is also noted for its unique fragrance, which is described as a mix of citrus and spice, adding to its allure."
