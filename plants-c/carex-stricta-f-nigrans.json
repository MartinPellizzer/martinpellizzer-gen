    "intro": "Carex stricta f. nigrans, commonly known as black stem sedges, is a variant of the slender sedges characterized by its dark, almost black stems. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in North America. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
