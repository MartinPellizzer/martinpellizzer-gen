    "intro": "Coincya montana, commonly known as the mountain marsh fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in wet soils, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Coincya montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and aquatic landscapes."
