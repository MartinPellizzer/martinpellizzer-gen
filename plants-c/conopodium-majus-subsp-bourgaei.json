    "intro": "Conopodium majus subsp. bourgaei, commonly known as the mountain penny-cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in early summer. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds through a unique mechanism involving a spring-loaded structure. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
