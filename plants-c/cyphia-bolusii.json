    "intro": "Cyphia bolusii, commonly known as the Bolus's cyphia, is a rare and striking plant native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cyphia bolusii is often found growing in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
