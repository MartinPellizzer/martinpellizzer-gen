    "intro": "Crepis bakeri subsp. cusickii, commonly known as the Cusick's crested grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces numerous seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, disturbed habitats such as sandy soils and open fields. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and contribute to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
