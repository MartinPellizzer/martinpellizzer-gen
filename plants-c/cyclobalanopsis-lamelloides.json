    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis lamelloides, commonly known as the broad-leafed ironwood, is a species of evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by oval-shaped nuts enclosed in a spiky husk. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in dense forests with high humidity. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered an important but threatened species in its natural habitat."
