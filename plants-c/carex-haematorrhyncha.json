    "intro": "Carex haematorrhyncha, commonly known as the blood-veined sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its flowering spikes produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and it plays a role in supporting local insect populations. The plant's name refers to the reddish veins visible in its leaves, which give it its distinctive appearance."
