    "intro": "Calla angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf calla, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It features elongated, narrow leaves that emerge from the water's surface, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow spatheae, which enclose the small, clustered flowers. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, preferring full sun to partial shade. Calla angustifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in ponds and water gardens."
