    "intro": "Cyathea rouhaniana, commonly known as the Rouhan's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and facilitating nutrient absorption. The fronds are typically evergreen and can persist for several years, contributing to the plant's ornamental value."
