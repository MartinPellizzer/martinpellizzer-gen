    "intro": "Chenopodium berlandieri f. gracile, commonly known as buffalo bur, is a perennial flowering plant native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. It is also considered a weed in some agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and persistence."
