    "intro": "Camellia parvimuricata var. songtaoensis, commonly known as the Songtao camellia, is a rare and ornamental evergreen shrub native to China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, glossy dark green leaves. The plant produces showy, camellia-like flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking winter color. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialty nurseries."
