It is characterized by its distinctive purple to pink flowers and spiny, bract-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its showy, composite flower heads. The variety thuretii is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Centaurea pectinata."
