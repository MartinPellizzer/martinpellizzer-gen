    "intro": "Cuscuta epilinum, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has a highly branched, thread-like stem that wraps around its host. The plant is widespread in temperate regions and can infest a variety of agricultural and ornamental crops. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, making it an invasive species in many areas. Despite its parasitic nature, Cuscuta epilinum plays a role in certain ecosystems by providing food for insects and other small animals."
