    "intro": "Carex grallatoria subsp. heteroclita, commonly known as the heterogeneous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its morphological variations, particularly in leaf and inflorescence structures compared to other Carex species."
