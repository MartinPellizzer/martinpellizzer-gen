    "intro": "Clematis delavayi var. spinescens, commonly known as the spiny clematis, is a perennial climbing vine native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It features slender, woody stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often supported by tendrils. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The variety is distinguished by its thorny stems, which provide structural support and contribute to its unique ecological role in its native habitat."
