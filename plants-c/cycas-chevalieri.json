    "intro": "Cycas chevalieri, commonly known as the Madagascar cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Madagascar. It is a slow-growing plant with a stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a characteristic known as dioecy. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in its native habitat."
