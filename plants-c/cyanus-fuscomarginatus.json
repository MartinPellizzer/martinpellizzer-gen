    "intro": "Cyanus fuscomarginatus, commonly known as the black-margin hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features bright blue to violet ray florets surrounded by yellow disk florets, with leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Cyanus fuscomarginatus thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions, although it can be invasive in certain ecosystems."
