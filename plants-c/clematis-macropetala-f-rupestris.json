    "intro": "Clematis macropetala f. rupestris, commonly known as the rock clematis, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has sturdy, woody stems that often grow along rocky surfaces or in crevices, making it well adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, blue-black berries in the fall. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
