    "intro": "Cavendishia pseudostenophylla, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, woolly white hair, providing insulation against cold temperatures. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a vibrant splash of color to its natural habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
