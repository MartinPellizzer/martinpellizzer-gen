    "intro": "Citharexylum lucidum, commonly known as the silver flame or silverleaf citharexylum, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, silvery-gray bark and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round, woody fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and air-purifying properties. Citharexylum lucidum is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
