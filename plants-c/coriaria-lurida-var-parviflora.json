    "intro": "Coriaria lurida var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf coralberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible for wildlife but toxic to humans. The plant has dark green, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces a distinctive, spicy scent when crushed. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
