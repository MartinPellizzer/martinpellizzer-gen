    "intro": "Coreopsis crawfordii, commonly known as the blackfoot coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces bright yellow, daisy-like flowers with narrow, pointed petals that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly rough texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in various soil types. Coreopsis crawfordii is well-suited for garden landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
