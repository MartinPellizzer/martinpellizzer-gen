    "intro": "Cyclosorus augescens, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its floating, palmate leaves that are divided into four to eight lobes, resembling a water lily. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration. Cyclosorus augescens is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize water bodies and improve water quality."
