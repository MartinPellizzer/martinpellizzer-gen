    "intro": "Clidemia marahuacensis, commonly known as the white-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and showy white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows on the branches of trees, drawing nutrients and water from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Clidemia marahuacensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of forest understories."
