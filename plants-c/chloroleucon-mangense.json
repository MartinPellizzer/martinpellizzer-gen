    "intro": "Chloroleucon mangense, commonly known as the mangrove chloroleucon, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as mangrove forests and tidal mudflats. The plant has slender, often woody stems that can grow up to several meters in height. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and typically have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, contributing to its ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
