    "intro": "Crocus insularis var. geminiflorus, commonly known as the double-flowered island crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces showy, fragrant flowers with two sets of petals, giving it a distinctive, almost double-bloom appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10-15 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, blooming in late winter or early spring. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to naturalize easily in suitable climates."
