    "intro": "Catasetum tenebrosum, commonly known as the dark catasetum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, yellow-and-red flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage for optimal growth. Catasetum tenebrosum is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
