    "intro": "Cicerbita rosea, commonly known as the roseleaf bittercress, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, rose-like pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs and produces small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge. Its flowers are followed by small, round seed pods that split open to release the seeds. Cicerbita rosea thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
