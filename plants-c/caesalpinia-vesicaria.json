    "intro": "Caesalpinia vesicaria, commonly known as the bubblegum tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its bright red or orange pods that resemble inflated bubbles, which give the plant its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, and its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple small leaflets. Caesalpinia vesicaria thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. It is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking floral display."
