    "intro": "Cuspidaria bracteolata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces distinctive, spiny seed pods that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many agricultural areas."
