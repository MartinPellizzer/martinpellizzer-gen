It is characterized by its tall, upright flowering stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, greenish-brown flowers in spike-like clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense clumps. Carex supermascula thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks."
