    "intro": "Clusia eugenioides, commonly known as the waxleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, dark green leaves that are often glossy and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often used as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Clusia eugenioides is also valued for its ability to tolerate shade and poor soil conditions."
