    "intro": "Crotalaria parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved cowpea or velvet bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, oblong pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as a protein source in some parts of the world. Crotalaria parvifolia is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant in agricultural systems. However, it can be toxic to livestock if ingested in large quantities."
