    "intro": "Catha rothiana, commonly known as the African khat, is a flowering plant native to the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant is known for its stimulant properties due to the presence of cathinone and cathine in its leaves."
