    "intro": "Ceropegia papuana, commonly known as the Papuan milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific islands, particularly Papua and New Guinea. It is a herbaceous perennial with trailing stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, intricate structure. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, and it prefers well-drained soil in a sunny to partially shaded environment. Ceropegia papuana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
