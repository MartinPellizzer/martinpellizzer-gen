    "intro": "Cereus baxaniensis var. ramosus, commonly known as the branching night bloomer, is a cacti species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that often branch out into a tree-like structure. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its thick, waxy cuticle helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. The species is relatively slow-growing and requires well-drained soil and minimal water to thrive."
