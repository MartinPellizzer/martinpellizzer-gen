It is characterized by its large, showy red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling flames. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or elliptical in shape. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure."
