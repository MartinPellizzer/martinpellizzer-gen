    "intro": "Codiaeum triumphans, commonly known as the flame maple, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, colorful, and often variegated leaves that can display shades of red, orange, yellow, and green. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. While it produces small, inconspicuous flowers, its primary ornamental value lies in its foliage."
