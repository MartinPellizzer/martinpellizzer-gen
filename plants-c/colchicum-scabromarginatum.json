    "intro": "Colchicum scabromarginatum, commonly known as the rough-margin colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Colchicaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often violet or purple, spurred flowers that appear in late summer. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its bulbs are toxic and contain colchicine, a compound with historical use in medicine and research. Colchicum scabromarginatum typically grows in woodland or shaded areas, preferring moist, well-drained soils."
