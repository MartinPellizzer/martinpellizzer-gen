    "intro": "Callianthe rufinerva, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red veins on pale green leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a subtle red tinge. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
