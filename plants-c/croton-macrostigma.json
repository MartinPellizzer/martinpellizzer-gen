    "intro": "Croton macrostigma, commonly known as the giant croton, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, often with a vibrant mix of green, red, and yellow hues. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by orange or red seed pods. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
