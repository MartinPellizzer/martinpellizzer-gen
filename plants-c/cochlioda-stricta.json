    "intro": "Cochlioda stricta, commonly known as the rigid cochlioda, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant features slender, erect stems and compound leaves with finely divided lobes. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbrella-like clusters, which attract pollinators like bees and flies. The roots of Cochlioda stricta are often used in traditional medicine for their purported tonic and digestive properties."
