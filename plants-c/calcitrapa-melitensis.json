It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, pale blue or white flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Calcitrapa melitensis is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and inland environments."
