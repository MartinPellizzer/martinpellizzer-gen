    "intro": "Cydonia vulgaris aurantia, commonly known as the honeycrack or golden quince, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces fragrant, yellow-orange flowers in the spring, which are followed by distinctive, rough-skinned fruits that ripen in late summer. The fruit has a sweet, aromatic flavor when fully mature and is often used in jams, jellies, and baked goods. The plant is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
