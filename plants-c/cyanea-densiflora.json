    "intro": "Cyanea densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered Cyanea, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a glossy surface, while its stems are woody and often covered in fine hairs. Cyanea densiflora is adapted to the moist, shaded environments of Hawaii's rainforests."
