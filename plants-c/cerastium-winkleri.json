    "intro": "Cerastium winkleri, commonly known as the Winkler's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
