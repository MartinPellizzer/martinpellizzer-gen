It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant has heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in harsh, sandy soils. Botanically, it belongs to the family Convolvulaceae, which includes other flowering plants with similar climbing or trailing growth habits."
