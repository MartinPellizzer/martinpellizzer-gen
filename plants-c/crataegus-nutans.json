    "intro": "Crataegus nutans, commonly known as the drooping hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in autumn. Crataegus nutans is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
