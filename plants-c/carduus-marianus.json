    "intro": "Carduus marianus, commonly known as the Marian thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by distinctive prickly, spherical fruits. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
