    "intro": "Cypripedium bullenianum var. appletonianum, commonly known as the Appleton's lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking, slipper-shaped pink or purple flower with a distinctive yellow throat. The plant typically grows in dense, moist forests and is adapted to low light conditions. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces a single, showy flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
