    "intro": "Ctenopteris fuscopilosa, commonly known as the dark-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are dispersed through wind. The plant's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for aquatic and terrarium settings."
