    "intro": "Ceraia calceola, commonly known as the little sandwort, is a small, flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing on rocky soils or in sandy habitats. Its compact growth form and ability to store water in its leaves help it endure periods of drought. Ceraia calceola is often found in Mediterranean climates and is considered a delicate, ornamental species in horticulture."
