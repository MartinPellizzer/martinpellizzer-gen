    "intro": "Carum decussatum, commonly known as lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glossy leaves that are typically heart-shaped and arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, often forming dense mats in moist, shady environments. Botanically, it belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic herbs like parsley and dill."
