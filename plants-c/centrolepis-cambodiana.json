    "intro": "Centrolepis cambodiana, commonly known as the Cambodian clubmoss, is a unique vascular plant belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae. It is a small, creeping plant that forms dense mats on the forest floor, often in humid and shaded environments. The plant has elongated, needle-like leaves that are spirally arranged around its stems. Its reproductive structures, known as strobili, are cone-like and contain the plant's spores. Centrolepis cambodiana is of interest to botanists due to its primitive features and its role in understanding the evolution of early land plants."
