    "intro": "Clibadium polygynum, commonly known as the African snakewood, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny capsule, which aids in seed dispersal. Clibadium polygynum is valued for its durable wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and tool-making."
