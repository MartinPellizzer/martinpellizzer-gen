    "intro": "Calceolaria herzogiana, commonly known as the Herzog's slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that resemble small cups, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found growing in rocky or alpine regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help to retain moisture in its native habitat. Calceolaria herzogiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
