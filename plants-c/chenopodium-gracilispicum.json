    "intro": "Chenopodium gracilispicum, commonly known as slender-stalked goosefoot, is a flowering plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico. The plant is characterized by its thin, erect stems and small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it produces small, dry fruits called utricles. Chenopodium gracilispicum is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments."
