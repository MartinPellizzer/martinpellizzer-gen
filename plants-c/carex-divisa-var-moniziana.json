    "intro": "Carex divisa var. moniziana, commonly known as the divided sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, which is typically narrow and arranged in dense, grass-like clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds and streams. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens."
