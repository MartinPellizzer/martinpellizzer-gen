    "intro": "Crocus sakariensis, commonly known as the Sakar Island crocus, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Sakar in the Aegean Sea. It is a member of the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, often violet or white, blossoms. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
