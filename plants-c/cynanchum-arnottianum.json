    "intro": "Cynanchum arnottianum, commonly known as the Arnott's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Cynanchum arnottianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
