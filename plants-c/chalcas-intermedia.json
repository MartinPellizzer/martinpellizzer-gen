It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible fruits that are similar in appearance to coconuts. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, requiring warm temperatures and well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
