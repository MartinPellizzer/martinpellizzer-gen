    "intro": "Centaurea decipiens var. microptilon, commonly known as the dwarf centaury, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branched stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, bright blue to purple flowers arranged in compact clusters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
