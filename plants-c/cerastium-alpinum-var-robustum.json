    "intro": "Cerastium alpinum var. robustum, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial species with small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
