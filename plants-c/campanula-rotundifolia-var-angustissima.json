    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia var. angustissima, commonly known as narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to violet in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. The leaves are rounded and often have a hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its natural habitat. This variety is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and naturalized landscapes."
