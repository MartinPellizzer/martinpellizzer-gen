    "intro": "Cephalophilon glaciale, commonly known as the glacier crownflower, is a rare alpine plant native to high-elevation regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a basal rosette of silver-white, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. The plant produces delicate, yellowish flowers arranged in a single head at the end of each stem, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
