    "intro": "Carex pairae subsp. leersii, commonly known as the Leers' sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce wind-pollinated flowers, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wet habitats. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in diverse wetland conditions."
