    "intro": "Cephalophyllum curtophyllum, commonly known as the short-leafed cephalophyllum, is a rare and unique member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of northern Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of short, woolly spines. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom in late spring and are relatively short in length. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
