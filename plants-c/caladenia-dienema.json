    "intro": "Caladenia dienema, commonly known as the pink fairy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and a single, striking pink or lilac flower. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils within open forests or heathlands. It blooms during late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, spurred labellum that distinguishes it from other orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
