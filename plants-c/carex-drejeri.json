    "intro": "Carex drejeri, commonly known as the Drejer's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, rushes, and grass-like plants. This species typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its foliage is grass-like, with narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are usually dark green. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, contributing to its ecological importance in wetland habitats."
