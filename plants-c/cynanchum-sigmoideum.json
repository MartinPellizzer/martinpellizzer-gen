    "intro": "Cynanchum sigmoideum, commonly known as the zigzag milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores. Cynanchum sigmoideum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
