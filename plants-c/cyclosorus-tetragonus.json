    "intro": "Cyclosorus tetragonus, commonly known as the four-angled water clover, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of four-angled, oval-shaped leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with a distinctive spurred structure, typical of the family. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
