    "intro": "Carex incurva var. brevirostris, commonly known as the narrow-beak sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces three-sided, boat-shaped seeds. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact inflorescence compared to other Carex species."
