    "intro": "Crotalaria pulcherrima, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive crown-like inflorescence, which consists of clusters of bright yellow flowers surrounded by spiny bracts. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its leaves are palmately compound, with five to seven leaflets, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
