It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces a single, erect stem with several leaves and blooms during the autumn season. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is known for its specialized pollination mechanism involving certain insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
