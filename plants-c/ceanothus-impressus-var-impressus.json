    "intro": "Ceanothus impressus var. impressus, commonly known as the narrowleaf ceanothus, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
