It belongs to the genus Carex in the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its leaves are grass-like, with a triangular cross-section, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually wind-pollinated.
