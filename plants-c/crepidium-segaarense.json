    "intro": "Crepidium segaarense, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the rainforests of Madagascar. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a delicate, greenish-yellow inflorescence that bears small, fragrant flowers. The plant has a pseudobulb structure typical of many orchids, which helps it store water and nutrients. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, contributing to its limited distribution and ecological niche. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas."
