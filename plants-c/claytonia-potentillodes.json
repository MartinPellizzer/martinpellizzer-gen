It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically green with a reddish or purplish tinge. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or lavender, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Claytonia potentillodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in early-season pollination."
