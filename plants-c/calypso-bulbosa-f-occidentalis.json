    "intro": "Calypso bulbosa f. occidentalis, commonly known as the western fairy orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a slender, rhizomatous growth habit and thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodland areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, fragrant blooms that are often a shade of pink or white. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
