    "intro": "Cyclosorus stenopodum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water clover, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation. The plant has thin, ribbon-like leaves that are often less than 1 cm in width, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Cyclosorus stenopodum is often found in nutrient-rich waters and can play a role in maintaining water clarity by absorbing excess nutrients."
