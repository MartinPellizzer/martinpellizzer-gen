    "intro": "Cardamine olympica, commonly known as Olympic watercress, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its small, kidney-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its scientific name reflects its limited distribution, as it is found primarily in Olympic National Park. Botanically, it belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous plants."
