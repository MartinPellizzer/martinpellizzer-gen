    "intro": "Centaurea nivea var. declinata, commonly known as the alpine blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in the summer months. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environments where the plant thrives. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. This variety is notable for its frost resistance and ability to withstand strong winds, making it a resilient member of the Asteraceae family."
