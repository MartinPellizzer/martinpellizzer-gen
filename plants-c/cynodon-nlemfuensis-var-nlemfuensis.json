    "intro": "Cynodon nlemfuensis var. nlemfuensis, commonly known as the Nlemfu grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central and Southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to a wide range of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. This species is often used in ornamental landscaping and for erosion control due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
