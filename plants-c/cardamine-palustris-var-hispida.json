    "intro": "Cardamine palustris var. hispida, commonly known as the hairy water cress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and moist woodland environments. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, branching stems. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils. It is often found in the understory of shaded forests or along the edges of streams and marshes."
