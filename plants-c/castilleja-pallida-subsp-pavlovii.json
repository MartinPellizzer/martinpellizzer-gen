    "intro": "Castilleja pallida subsp. pavlovii, commonly known as the pale castilleja subspecies pavlovii, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its green stems for photosynthesis. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, open habitats like grasslands and woodlands, often growing in association with other plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the growth of its host plants, making it an important component of its ecosystem."
