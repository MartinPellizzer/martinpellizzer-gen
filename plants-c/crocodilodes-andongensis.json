    "intro": "Crocodilodes andongensis, commonly known as the Andong crocodile plant, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of South Korea. This plant is characterized by its distinctive, crocodile-like appearance, with thick, waxy leaves that resemble the scales of a reptile. It is a succulent that stores water in its leaves, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a subtle beauty to its rugged appearance. Due to its limited habitat and threats from human activity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
