    "intro": "Cyathea heterochlamydea, commonly known as the variable tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant exhibits a unique variation in its spore-producing structures, with some fronds bearing strobili that are distinctly different in shape and size. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The botanical features of Cyathea heterochlamydea make it an important component of tropical forest ecosystems."
