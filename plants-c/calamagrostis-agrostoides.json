    "intro": "Calamagrostis agrostoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually bluish-green in color, and it produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flower heads. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments. Calamagrostis agrostoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience."
