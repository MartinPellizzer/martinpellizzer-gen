    "intro": "Centella hermanniifolia, commonly known as the Hermann's centella, is a creeping herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense mats over the ground. Centella hermanniifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
