It is characterized by its striking red or pink bottlebrush-like flowers that appear in dense spikes. The plant has narrow, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. The flowers attract nectar-feeding birds and insects, making it a valuable plant for wildlife gardens."
