    "intro": "Carpinus langaoensis, commonly known as the Langao hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It typically grows in lowland forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
