    "intro": "Cleistocactus capadalensis, commonly known as the Capadale cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Brazil. It is a small, globular cactus with a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces delicate, white flowers that bloom in the evening, a characteristic feature of many nocturnal flowering plants. Its spines are short and sparse, providing minimal protection but contributing to its unique appearance. Cleistocactus capadalensis is well adapted to extreme temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
