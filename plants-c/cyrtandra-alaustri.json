    "intro": "Cyrtandra alaustri, commonly known as the Hawaiian cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and streamside areas. It has opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for native birds. Due to habitat loss, Cyrtandra alaustri is considered endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts in Hawaii."
