    "intro": "Crataegus graeca, commonly known as the Greek hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters and features thorny branches, oval to elliptic leaves, and clusters of white or pinkish flowers in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often tart, and they ripen in late summer. Crataegus graeca is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its seasonal interest and ecological value."
