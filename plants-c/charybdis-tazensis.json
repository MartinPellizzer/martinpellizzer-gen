    "intro": "Charybdis tazensis, commonly known as the Tazan sea anemone, is a marine species found in the Caribbean Sea. It belongs to the family Actiniidae and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful tentacles that surround a central oral disc. The organism is a cnidarian, meaning it possesses stinging cells called nematocysts used for capturing prey. It typically inhabits shallow coastal waters and is often found attached to coral or rocky substrates. Due to its ecological role in marine ecosystems, it serves as both predator and prey in its environment."
