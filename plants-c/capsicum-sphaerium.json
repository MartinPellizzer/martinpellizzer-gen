    "intro": "Capsicum sphaerium, commonly known as the globe pepper. It is a rare and unique species of pepper native to South America, particularly Brazil. This plant is characterized by its small, round fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. The leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small white flowers. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in culinary applications due to its mild flavor and small size."
