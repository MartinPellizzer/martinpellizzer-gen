    "intro": "Chorizanthe umbellata, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Chorizanthe umbellata is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
