    "intro": "Cyperus diamantinus, commonly known as diamond sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with small, triangular leaves that are often covered in a waxy, whitish coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, which are arranged in panicles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of water bodies. Cyperus diamantinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a water filtration plant."
