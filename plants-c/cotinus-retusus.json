    "intro": "Cotinus retusus, commonly known as the smooth flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 20 centimeters long and have a smooth, almost waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, papery bracts that give it its common name. Cotinus retusus thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for a variety of garden settings."
