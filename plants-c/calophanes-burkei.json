    "intro": "Calophanes burkei, commonly known as the Burke's calophane, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it adapts to cooler temperatures and lower atmospheric pressure. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Calophanes burkei produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
