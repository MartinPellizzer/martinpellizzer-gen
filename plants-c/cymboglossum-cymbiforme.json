    "intro": "Cymboglossum cymbiforme, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mound-like growth habit and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, while the flowers bloom from late spring to early summer. Cymboglossum cymbiforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
