    "intro": "Coelogyne integrilabia, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically blooms during the dry season, with inflorescences that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and help store water, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Coelogyne integrilabia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
