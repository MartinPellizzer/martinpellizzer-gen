It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and along the edges of water bodies. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are often hidden among the foliage. Cyperus hansenii is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in moist conditions."
