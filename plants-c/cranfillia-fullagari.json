    "intro": "Cranfillia fullagari, commonly known as the Florida sand pine, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and inland dune environments. Cranfillia fullagari plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
