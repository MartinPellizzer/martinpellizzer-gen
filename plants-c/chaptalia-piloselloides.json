It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, and its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs. Chaptalia piloselloides is often considered a weed but can serve as a food source for certain insects."
