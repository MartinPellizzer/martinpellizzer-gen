    "intro": "Coronopus squamatus var. depressus, commonly known as the dwarf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features a dense mat of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise desolate habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or dry landscapes. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
