    "intro": "Cyathea hirtula, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a distinctive feature of ferns. Cyathea hirtula thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of tropical forest ecosystems."
