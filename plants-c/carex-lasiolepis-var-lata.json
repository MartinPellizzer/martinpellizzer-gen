It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
