    "intro": "Carduus pedemontanus, commonly known as the Pedemontan thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, silvery-green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces purple to violet flower heads that are typically surrounded by bracts, which are often more showy than the actual flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, rocky areas, and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
