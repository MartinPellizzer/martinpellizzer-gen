It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Its bark is often deeply fissured and has a distinctive grayish-white color. Cleidion coriaceum is valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
