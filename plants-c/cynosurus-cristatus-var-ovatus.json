    "intro": "Cynosurus cristatus var. ovatus, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, hairy leaves that are often curved or rolled. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, greenish to brownish flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a component in ecological restoration projects."
