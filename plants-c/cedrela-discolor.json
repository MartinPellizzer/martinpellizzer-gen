    "intro": "Cedrela discolor, commonly known as the yellow cedar or white cedar, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often fragrant bark and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, Cedrela discolor is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
