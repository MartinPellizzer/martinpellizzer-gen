    "intro": "Centaurea pallescens subsp. calcitrapella, commonly known as the calcareous centaury, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils, thriving in rocky or limestone-rich environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas."
