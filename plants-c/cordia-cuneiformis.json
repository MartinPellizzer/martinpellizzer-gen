    "intro": "Cordia cuneiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cordia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters, featuring lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale yellow to white, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it is often found in dry, open habitats such as savannas and coastal areas. Cordia cuneiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some indigenous cultures."
