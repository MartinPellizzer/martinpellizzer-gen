    "intro": "Corrigiola paniculata, commonly known as sea blite, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing annual or biennial plant that thrives in saline and sandy soils. The plant features small, green, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its succulent nature allows it to retain water, making it well-adapted to coastal environments. Corrigiola paniculata is often used in traditional medicine and is also a food source for certain wildlife species."
