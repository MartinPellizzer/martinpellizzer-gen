    "intro": "Cnemidostachys prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and grasslands. The plant has a prostrate growth habit, with its stems lying flat on the ground and producing clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps in moisture retention. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance."
