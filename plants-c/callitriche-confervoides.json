It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has whorled leaves that are often submerged, with small, white flowers that appear at the water's surface. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize sediment in aquatic habitats. Callitriche confervoides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
