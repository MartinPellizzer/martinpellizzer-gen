It is a deciduous tree native to China, particularly found in the Yunnan and Guangxi provinces. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated margin. Cyclobalanopsis ningangensis is valued for its ecological role in forest ecosystems and its potential economic importance due to its strong, heavy timber."
