    "intro": "Cirsium liukiuense, commonly known as the Liuqu Island thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and rocky habitats, adapting to the humid and saline conditions of its environment. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant produces small, inconspicuous fruits that disperse its seeds by wind. Due to its limited distribution, Cirsium liukiuense is considered a rare and endemic species."
