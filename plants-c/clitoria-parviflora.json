    "intro": "Clitoria parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered butterfly pea, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Asia. It features delicate, butterfly-like blue or purple flowers that are highly ornamental and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three small, heart-shaped leaflets. Its stems are hairy and often twine around supports, making it a popular choice for vertical gardening. The seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
