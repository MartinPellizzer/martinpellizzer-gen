    "intro": "Centaurea mengenensis, commonly known as Mengen's cornflower, is a flowering plant native to the high mountain regions of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet petals and a distinctive central cone-like structure. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas, thriving in cool, moist environments. It has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
