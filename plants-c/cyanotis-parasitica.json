    "intro": "Cyanotis parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic bluebell, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Commelinaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant features showy, blue-violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can be found in association with various host species in tropical and subtropical regions."
