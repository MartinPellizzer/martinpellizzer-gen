    "intro": "Cardaria draba var. repens, commonly known as the creeping whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs. This species is adapted to rocky and disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
