    "intro": "Crotalaria ferruginea var. major, commonly known as the redroot cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that are typically hairy and contain several elliptical seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in agricultural settings as a cover crop or for soil improvement."
