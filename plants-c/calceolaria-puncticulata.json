    "intro": "Calceolaria puncticulata, commonly known as the dotted calceolaria, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that resemble small cups, with a unique central pouch that aids in pollination by insects. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Calceolaria puncticulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
