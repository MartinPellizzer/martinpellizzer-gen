    "intro": "Carpinus caucasica, commonly known as Caucasian hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a glossy upper surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by small, edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and adaptability."
