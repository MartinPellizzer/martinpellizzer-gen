    "intro": "Cirsium gregarium, commonly known as the clustered thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green leaves and purple to pink flower heads that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Cirsium gregarium is often found in clusters, giving it its common name, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
