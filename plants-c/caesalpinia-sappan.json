It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and bright red or orange floral clusters. The plant produces pods that contain flat, dark seeds, and its wood is highly valued for its rich, reddish hue. Caesalpinia sappan thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. It is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dye."
