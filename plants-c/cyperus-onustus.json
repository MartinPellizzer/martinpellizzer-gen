    "intro": "Cyperus onustus, commonly known as the swamp spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a spike, typically reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. Cyperus onustus thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life. It is native to parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia, and is often found in areas with saturated soil conditions."
