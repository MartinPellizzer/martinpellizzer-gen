    "intro": "Cornus tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin dogwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cornaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam and China, and is characterized by its showy, white or pink bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its fruit is a small, red drupe that develops after the bracts fall off, and it is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Cornus tonkinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic features."
