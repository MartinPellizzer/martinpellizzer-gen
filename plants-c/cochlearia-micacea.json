    "intro": "Cochlearia micacea, commonly known as the white sand catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a member of the mustard family (Brassicaceae) and is characterized by its small, white flowers and low-growing habit. The plant typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Cochlearia micacea plays a role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
