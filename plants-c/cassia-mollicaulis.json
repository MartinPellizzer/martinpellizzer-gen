    "intro": "Cassia mollicaulis, commonly known as velvetwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, bark-like trunk and dense foliage, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces clusters of yellow, papery flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are typically compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are arranged oppositely along the stems. Cassia mollicaulis is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
