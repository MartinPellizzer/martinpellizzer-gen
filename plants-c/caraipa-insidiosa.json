    "intro": "Caraipa insidiosa, commonly known as the insidious caraipa, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers are often pink or purple, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Caraipa insidiosa is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
