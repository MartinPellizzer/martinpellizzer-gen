    "intro": "Cercodia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate cercodia, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many species adapted to dry, coastal environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
