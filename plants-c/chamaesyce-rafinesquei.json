    "intro": "Chamaesyce rafinesquei, commonly known as the Rafinesque's sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its prostrate habit, with fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, dry fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dunes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
