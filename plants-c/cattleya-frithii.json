    "intro": "Cattleya frithii, commonly known as the Frith's Cattleya, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange, often with a contrasting purple or red lip. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil, and it requires high humidity and bright, indirect light. Cattleya frithii is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
