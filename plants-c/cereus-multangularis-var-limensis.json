    "intro": "Cereus multangularis var. limensis, commonly known as the Limen's angel's wings, is a cactus species native to the Andes Mountains of Peru. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and large, white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a spiny exterior with areoles that bear both spines and flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its striking appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and botanical collections."
