    "intro": "Cedrela teysmannii, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree belonging to the Meliaceae family. It is native to regions of Africa, including countries like Ghana and Nigeria, and thrives in humid, tropical climates. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a dense canopy. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local economies. However, overharvesting has led to its decline, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat."
