    "intro": "Cirsium serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered with stiff, bristly hairs, while its flowers are composed of both ray and disc florets. Cirsium serrulatum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
