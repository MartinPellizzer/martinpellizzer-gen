    "intro": "Ctenopteris brevistipes, commonly known as the short-leaf sea holly, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dicksoniaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including parts of India, China, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its compact,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and distinctive, fan-shaped fronds with a waxy coating. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
