    "intro": "Chloris humilis, commonly known as slender grass or small bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland areas with well-drained conditions. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces tiny blue or purplish flowers, which are attractive to pollinators. Chloris humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soils in erosion-prone environments."
