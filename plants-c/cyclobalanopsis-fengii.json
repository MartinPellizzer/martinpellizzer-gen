    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis fengii, commonly known as the Feng's evergreen oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family, Fagaceae. It is native to southern China, particularly in Yunnan and Guangxi provinces, where it thrives in humid, subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on top, with a lighter underside. It produces small, cup-shaped fruits known as nuts, which are encased in a woody shell. Cyclobalanopsis fengii is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also of ecological importance in its native habitat."
