    "intro": "Campyloneurum gracile, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocky surfaces. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of many fern species. Campyloneurum gracile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
