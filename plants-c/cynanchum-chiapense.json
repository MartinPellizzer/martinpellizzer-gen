    "intro": "Cynanchum chiapense, commonly known as the Chiapan devil's backbone, is a climbing vine native to Central America. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its milky sap and distinctive, ribbed stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruits are follicles containing toxic seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or medicinal purposes."
