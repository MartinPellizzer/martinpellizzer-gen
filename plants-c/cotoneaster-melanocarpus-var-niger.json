    "intro": "Cotoneaster melanocarpus var. niger, commonly known as black-fruited cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple to black berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
