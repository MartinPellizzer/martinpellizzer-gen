    "intro": "Cyperus mauritianus, commonly known as the Mauritius flatsedge, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the grass family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. Cyperus mauritianus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and remediate polluted water bodies."
