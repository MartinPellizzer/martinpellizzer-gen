    "intro": "Canarium globosum, commonly known as the globe nut or oil palm, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which eventually develop into woody capsules containing oily seeds. The seeds are rich in oil and are used in the production of cosmetics and biofuels. This species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in tropical rainforests."
