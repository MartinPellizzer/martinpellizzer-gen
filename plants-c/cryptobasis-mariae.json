    "intro": "Cryptobasis mariae, commonly known as the Marie's cryptobasis, is a rare and lesser-known species within the genus Cryptobasis. It is characterized by its unique morphological features, including its compact growth habit and specialized leaf structures. The plant exhibits a preference for specific microhabitats, often found in shaded, moist environments within temperate regions. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters during the late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cryptobasis mariae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
