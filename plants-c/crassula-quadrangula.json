    "intro": "Crassula quadrangula, commonly known as the four-angled crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, four-sided stems and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
