    "intro": "Cheilanthes lemmonii var. australis, commonly known as the southern leatherwood, is a terrestrial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is typically found in crevices or on cliffs, where it can retain moisture. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This variety is distinguished from other forms of Cheilanthes lemmonii by its slightly broader leaves and geographic distribution."
