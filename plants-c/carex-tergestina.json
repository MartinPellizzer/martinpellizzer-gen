    "intro": "Carex tergestina, commonly known as the Tergestina sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear yellowish-green flowers. It is characterized by its robust rhizomes and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water retention. Carex tergestina plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
