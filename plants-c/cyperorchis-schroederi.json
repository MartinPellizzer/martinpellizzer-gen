    "intro": "Cyperorchis schroederi, commonly known as the Schr\u00f6der's sedge orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the eastern United States. It is a terrestrial herb with a rhizomatous root system and produces a dense cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant blooms with small, greenish-white flowers that are arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
