    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis subsp. typica, commonly known as water shield, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are submerged or floating, with small white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its rhizomes help it spread and form dense colonies, contributing to the structure of aquatic ecosystems. The species is valued for its role in supporting aquatic biodiversity and as an indicator of water quality."
