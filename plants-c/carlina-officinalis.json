    "intro": "Carlina officinalis, commonly known as the medicinal cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features silver-gray leaves with a hairy texture and produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Carlina officinalis is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Its historical use in traditional medicine is attributed to its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
