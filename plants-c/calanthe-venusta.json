    "intro": "Calanthe venusta, commonly known as the fragrant calanthe, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the base. Calanthe venusta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
