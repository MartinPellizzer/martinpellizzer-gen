    "intro": "Cereus speciosissimus var. bowtrianus, commonly known as the Queen of the Night, is a cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and clusters of large, white, fragrant flowers that bloom only at night. The plant has spiny, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening for only a few hours before closing in the early morning. This species is popular among cactus enthusiasts for its striking appearance and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
