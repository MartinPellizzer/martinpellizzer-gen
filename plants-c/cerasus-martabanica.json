It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Myanmar, Thailand, and India. The plant is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by the development of small, bright red cherries. The fruit is typically edible, though it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
