    "intro": "Corispermum borysthenicum, commonly known as the Siberian sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the steppes of Central Asia. It is a low-growing, annual herb that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its seeds are enclosed in a hard, spherical capsule. It has a fibrous root system adapted to sandy and arid soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh environments. The species is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
