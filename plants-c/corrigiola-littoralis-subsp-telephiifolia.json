    "intro": "Corrigiola littoralis subsp. telephiifolia, commonly known as the coastal sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically pink or white, appearing in clusters at the tips of the stems. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
