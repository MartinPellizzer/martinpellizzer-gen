    "intro": "Cornus tomentosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its grayish-tomentose (fuzzy) bark and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red berries that are a food source for various birds and small mammals. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a rough texture. Cornus tomentosa is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
