    "intro": "Cenchrus orientalis, commonly known as the oriental grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common weed in agricultural fields. Its fibrous roots contribute to soil stabilization, and it has been used historically for thatching and as a source of fiber."
