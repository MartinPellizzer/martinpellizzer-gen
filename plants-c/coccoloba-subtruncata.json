    "intro": "Coccoloba subtruncata, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in brackish or saltwater environments, often found in mangrove swamps and coastal areas. Its unique adaptations allow it to survive in submerged and saline conditions, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
