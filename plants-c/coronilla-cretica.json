    "intro": "Coronilla cretica, commonly known as Greek crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. The plant is characterized by its deep root system, which helps it thrive in poor, rocky soils. It is often used for erosion control due to its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen. Coronilla cretica is also valued in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
