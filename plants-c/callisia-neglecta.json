    "intro": "Callisia neglecta, commonly known as the spider plant, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It features long, trailing stems with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is well-suited for hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its spreading habit. Callisia neglecta is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright indirect light and moderate watering."
