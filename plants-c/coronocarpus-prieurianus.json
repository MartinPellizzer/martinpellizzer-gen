    "intro": "Coronocarpus prieurianus, commonly known as the mountain daisy, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other composite flowers. The plant is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. Coronocarpus prieurianus is well adapted to high-altitude environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
