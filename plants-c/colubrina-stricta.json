    "intro": "Colubrina stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf colubrina, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bean-like, hairy pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and dry habitats. Colubrina stricta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to support local wildlife."
