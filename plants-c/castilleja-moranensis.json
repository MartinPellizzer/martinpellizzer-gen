    "intro": "Castilleja moranensis, commonly known as Moran's paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its specialized root system. The plant produces vibrant red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
