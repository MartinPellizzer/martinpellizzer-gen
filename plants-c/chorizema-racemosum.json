    "intro": "Chorizema racemosum, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in racemes, which are elongated clusters of flowers. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Chorizema racemosum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
