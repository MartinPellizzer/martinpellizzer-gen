    "intro": "Cryptogramma bithynica, commonly known as the Bithynian cryptogramma, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its small, erect growth form and is typically found in rocky or sandy habitats. The leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate, with a distinct costa that extends to the apex. It is a cryptogamic plant, meaning it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This species is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
