It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and sensitive species."
