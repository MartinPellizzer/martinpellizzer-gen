    "intro": "Crepidopteris endlicheriana, commonly known as the golden sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its long, strap-like fronds that are typically bright green with a golden sheen. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist substrates such as soil or rock. The fronds are pinnately compound, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance."
