    "intro": "Chrysothamnus parryi var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada goldenbush, is a shrub native to the western United States, particularly found in Nevada and adjacent states. It is characterized by its dense, yellowish-green foliage and produces small, yellow flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry slopes. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The Nevada goldenbush is an important component of local ecosystems, providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
