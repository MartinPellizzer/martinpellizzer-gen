    "intro": "Cnicus cernuus, commonly known as the creeping thistle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with silver-gray, woolly leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are typically arranged in a single terminal head. Its roots are fibrous and can spread extensively, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and rocky areas. Cnicus cernuus is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in waste areas, where it thrives in full sun."
