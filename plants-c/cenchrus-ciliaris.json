    "intro": "Cenchrus ciliaris, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with hairy margins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common species in dry grasslands and savannas. Due to its resilience, it is widely used for forage in livestock grazing and for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
