It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowering spikes are usually borne on tall, slender stems, and the flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. This variety is distinguished by its taller stature compared to the typical form of Carex tentaculata."
