It features strap-like, broad leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in moist soils near water bodies, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage and floral structure are adapted to its wetland habitat, making it a distinctive component of riparian ecosystems. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens with appropriate moisture conditions."
