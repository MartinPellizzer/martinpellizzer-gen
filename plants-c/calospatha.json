    "intro": "Calospatha, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a calospatha. The calospatha serves as a protective covering for the spadix and is often brightly colored to attract pollinators. These plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental foliage and unusual floral structures."
