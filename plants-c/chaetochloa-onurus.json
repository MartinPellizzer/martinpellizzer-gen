    "intro": "Chaetochloa onurus, commonly known as the silky grass or silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silky-textured leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on moist, shaded soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, followed by three-winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is often found in wetland habitats such as marshes and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
