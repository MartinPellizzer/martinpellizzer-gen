    "intro": "Conyza scariosa, commonly known as the roughleaf fleabane, is an annual flowering plant native to Africa, South America, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features finely hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its yellow flowers bloom in clusters and are typically visited by various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Conyza scariosa is often found in disturbed habitats like roadsides and fields, where it thrives in full sun."
