    "intro": "Clematis obtusidentata, commonly known as the Japanese clematis, is a deciduous vine native to East Asia. It features compound leaves with ovate to elliptic leaflets and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, blue to purple berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental vines. Its botanical classification places it in the Ranunculaceae family, sharing traits with other members of the genus Clematis."
