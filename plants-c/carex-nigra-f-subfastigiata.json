It is characterized by its dark, glossy, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a tight, upright cluster. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective plant for erosion control and habitat creation for various wildlife species."
