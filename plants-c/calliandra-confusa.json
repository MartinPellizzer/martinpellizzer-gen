    "intro": "Calliandra confusa, commonly known as the pink calliandra, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery, pink to red inflorescences that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, bean-like pods that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its attractive flowers and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is also used in ecological restoration projects."
