    "intro": "Carex bidentula, commonly known as the two-tooth sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers, typically green or brown, which are wind-pollinated. Carex bidentula thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
