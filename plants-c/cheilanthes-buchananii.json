    "intro": "Cheilanthes buchananii, commonly known as the Buchanan's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rock surfaces, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with closely spaced, fleshy rhizomes and small, linear leaves. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, typical of fern reproductive structures. It is adapted to survive in harsh, rocky habitats with limited soil and water availability."
