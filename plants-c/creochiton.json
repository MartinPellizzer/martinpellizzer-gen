It belongs to the family Achatinellidae and is characterized by its elongated, spiral-shaped shell. The shell is typically smooth and ranges in color from pale yellow to brown, depending on the species. Creochiton thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and gardens. Its diet consists mainly of decaying plant matter and leaf litter, contributing to nutrient cycling in its habitat."
