It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its pungent odor reminiscent of garlic. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in a saccate capsule, and the plant is often invasive in new environments. It thrives in moist, shaded areas and is known for its allelopathic properties that inhibit the growth of other plants."
