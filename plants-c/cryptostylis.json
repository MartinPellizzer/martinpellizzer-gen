    "intro": "Cryptostylis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique member of the orchid family, native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and pale green or white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, relying on epiphytic growth rather than soil for nutrients. Its delicate appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Cryptostylis is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
