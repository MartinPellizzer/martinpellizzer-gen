    "intro": "Chlorospatha caldasensis, commonly known as the Caldasensis sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of Colombia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
