    "intro": "Cyperus denticulatus, commonly known as the toothed flatsedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually greenish or brownish in color. Cyperus denticulatus is characterized by its distinctive tooth-like margins on the leaves, which give it its common name. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats and can sometimes be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
