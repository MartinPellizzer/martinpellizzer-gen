    "intro": "Cerastium decalvans var. durmitoreum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically opposite and ovate in shape. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes."
