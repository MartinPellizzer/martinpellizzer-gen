    "intro": "Cerasus erythrocarpa lusus albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered cherry, is a rare and ornamental species within the Prunus genus. It is characterized by its delicate white flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the emergence of leaves. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with slender branches and a compact form. Its leaves are ovate, glossy, and provide a striking contrast to the pale blossoms. While it is not widely cultivated, it is valued for its aesthetic appeal in botanical gardens and specialized horticultural collections."
