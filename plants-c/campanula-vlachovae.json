    "intro": "Campanula vlachovae, commonly known as the Vlachovae bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, showing a preference for well-drained soils. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with a fine layer of white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Campanula vlachovae is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
