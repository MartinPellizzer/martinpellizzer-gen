    "intro": "Caucalis latifolia var. tuberculata, commonly known as the broadleaf caucalis, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Europe. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its tuberculate (wart-like) leaves give it its specific variety name, tuberculata."
