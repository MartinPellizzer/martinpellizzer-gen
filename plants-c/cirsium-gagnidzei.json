    "intro": "Cirsium gagnidzei, commonly known as the Gagnidze thistle, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Georgia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. It is a perennial herb that exhibits a rosette growth pattern during its early stages. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
