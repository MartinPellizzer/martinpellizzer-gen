    "intro": "Crepis filiformis, commonly known as the slender hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a single head. Native to Europe and western Asia, this species thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils. The plant produces achenes, which are small, dry fruits with a pappus for wind dispersal. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the hawk's-beard genus."
