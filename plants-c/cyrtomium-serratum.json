    "intro": "Cyrtomium serratum, commonly known as the serrated holly fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It features delicate, lace-like fronds with serrated edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies over time. Cyrtomium serratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, foliage."
