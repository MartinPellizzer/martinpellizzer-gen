It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically narrow and lanceolate, often with a hairy texture, and the plant produces small, cylindrical fruits known as capsules. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its delicate floral display."
