    "intro": "Ceratoides latens, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Ceratoides latens is often found in rocky soils and alpine habitats, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions."
