    "intro": "Coffea brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed coffee plant, is a species native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with dense foliage and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces white to pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries containing one to two seeds. These seeds, when processed, can be used to make coffee, though the plant is not widely cultivated for commercial coffee production. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant taxonomy and ecology."
