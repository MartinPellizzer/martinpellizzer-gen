    "intro": "Crupina crupinastrum subsp. morisii, commonly known as the Moris's crupina, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, exhibiting a compact growth habit with hairy stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
