    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 andrewsii, commonly known as the Andrews' lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, slipper-shaped flower with a distinctive pink or white pouch. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats, often on the forest floor. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
