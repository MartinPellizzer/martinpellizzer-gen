It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are small, clustered in cylindrical spikes. Cyperus moestus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
