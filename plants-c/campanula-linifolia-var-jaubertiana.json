It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and harsh mountain conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
