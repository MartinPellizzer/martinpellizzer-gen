    "intro": "Caladenia necrophylla, commonly known as the pale-veined spider orchid, is an endemic species of Western Australia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, erect stem and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in spring. The flower has a distinctive, narrow labellum with a pale greenish hue and intricate veining. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
