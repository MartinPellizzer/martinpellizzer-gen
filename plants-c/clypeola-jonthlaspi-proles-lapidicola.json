    "intro": "Clypeola jonthlaspi proles lapidicola, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a compact growth habit, with stems that spread horizontally along the ground. Its leaves are usually thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. The flowers are small and numerous, forming dense inflorescences that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
