    "intro": "Cheilanthes aemula, commonly known as the golden tansy fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a creeping rhizome with dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply pinnate. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Cheilanthes aemula is often used in rock gardens and is valued for its ornamental appearance and hardiness."
