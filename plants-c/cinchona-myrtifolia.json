It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant is notable for its medicinal properties, particularly the presence of alkaloids such as quinine, which has been historically used to treat malaria. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often found in cloud forests. Its ornamental value and pharmacological significance make it an important plant in both botanical gardens and traditional medicine."
