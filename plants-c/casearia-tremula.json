    "intro": "Casearia tremula, commonly known as the trembling casearia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical fruits that split open to release seeds. Its bark is fibrous and has been traditionally used in local herbal medicine. Casearia tremula thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories."
