    "intro": "Chorilepidella, commonly known as the spiny false nettle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Onagraceae. It consists of several species that are native to the Americas, particularly in regions of North and South America. The plants are characterized by their opposite leaves, which are often glandular and may have a sticky surface. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers with four petals, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny seeds. Chorilepidella species are typically found in moist habitats such as stream banks and wet meadows."
