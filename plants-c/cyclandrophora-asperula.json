    "intro": "Cyclandrophora asperula, commonly known as the rough-stemmed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically has succulent, hairy stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Cyclandrophora asperula is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
