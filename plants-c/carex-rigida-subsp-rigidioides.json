    "intro": "Carex rigida subsp. rigidioides, commonly known as rigid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil. The leaves are usually stiff and cylindrical, with a bluish-green hue when fresh."
