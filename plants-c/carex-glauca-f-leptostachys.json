    "intro": "Carex glauca f. leptostachys, commonly known as blue sedge, is a variant of the common blue sedge, characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It is a perennial plant native to North America, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, dark brown berries. Its foliage is often a striking blue-green color, which distinguishes it from other sedges. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wet or boggy soils."
