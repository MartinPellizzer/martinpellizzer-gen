It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped pouch that resembles a small, elongated cup. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. The genus Comparettia is part of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is known for its specialized floral structures and ecological adaptations."
