    "intro": "Cassipourea nana, commonly known as the dwarf cassipourea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than one meter, with dense, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
