It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, wet environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its leaves are alternate, with a distinctive lobed shape, and it produces small white or pale yellow flowers in early spring.
