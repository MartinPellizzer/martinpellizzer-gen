    "intro": "Castilleja muscipula, commonly known as the sticky monkeyflower, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It has bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant possesses specialized roots that attach to the roots of other plants, allowing it to absorb nutrients from its host. Its leaves are alternate and often covered in a sticky substance that helps in trapping small insects. Castilleja muscipula is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils."
