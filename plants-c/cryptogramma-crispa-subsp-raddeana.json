    "intro": "Cryptogramma crispa subsp. raddeana, commonly known as the raddean's cryptogramma, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizomes and its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
