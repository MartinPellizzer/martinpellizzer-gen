    "intro": "Calystegia fulcrata subsp. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue to violet in color. Its fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases seeds when mature. This species thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert or semi-arid regions."
