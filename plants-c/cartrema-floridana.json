    "intro": "Cartrema floridana, commonly known as the Florida cartrema, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the edges of wetlands and swampy areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
