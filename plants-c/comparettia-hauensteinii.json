    "intro": "Comparettia hauensteinii, commonly known as the Hauenstein's slipper orchid, is a rare and exotic orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a trap for pollinators. The plant produces striking, dark purple to black flowers with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific insect pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
