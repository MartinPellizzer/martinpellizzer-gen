    "intro": "Clavija subandina, commonly known as the Andean clavija, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible roots. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, and it is adapted to grow in cool, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Clavija subandina is often found in rocky or alpine regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
