    "intro": "Coleonema virginianum, commonly known as the Virginia woollynightshade, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant a woolly appearance. While it is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes, it plays a role in supporting local wildlife and ecosystems."
