    "intro": "Convolvulus trilobus, commonly known as the three-lobed morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in the morning, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, red or orange capsule that splits open when mature to release the seeds."
