    "intro": "Cyanea superba subsp. regina, commonly known as the Hawaiian rosewood, is a rare and endemic species found primarily on the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal and lowland areas. The plant is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and glossy, elliptical leaves. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Due to its limited habitat and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species."
