    "intro": "Castilleja filiflora, commonly known as the threadleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, thread-like leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It often grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in its native range."
