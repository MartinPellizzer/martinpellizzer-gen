    "intro": "Corallorhiza innata var. virescens, commonly known as the green coralroot, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the eastern United States. It is a non-photosynthetic orchid that relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for its nutrients, making it a myco-heterotroph. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its clusters of green to yellowish flowers. Its unique ecological role highlights the complex relationships between plants and fungi in forest ecosystems."
