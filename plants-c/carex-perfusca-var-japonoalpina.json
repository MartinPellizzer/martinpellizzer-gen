It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to cold climates. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native mountain environments."
