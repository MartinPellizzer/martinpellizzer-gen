    "intro": "Cyrtandra paludosa var. herbacea, commonly known as the marsh cyrtandra, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical regions. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and leaves. The plant typically produces small, tubular flowers in shades of white or pink, which are often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in swampy or marshy environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
