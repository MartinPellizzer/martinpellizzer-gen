    "intro": "Cleistes buenaventurae, commonly known as the Mexican bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has a short, erect stem and produces small, clustered leaves. It blooms during the summer months, producing nectar that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
