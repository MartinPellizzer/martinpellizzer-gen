    "intro": "Cheilanthes candida var. copelandii, commonly known as the Copeland's rockcap, is a terrestrial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and grayish-green, leathery fronds. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand drought conditions."
