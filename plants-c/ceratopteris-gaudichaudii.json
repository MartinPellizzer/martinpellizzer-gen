    "intro": "Ceratopteris gaudichaudii, commonly known as the New Caledonian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the island of New Caledonia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Ceratopteris gaudichaudii plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various aquatic organisms."
