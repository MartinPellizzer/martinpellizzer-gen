It is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage, which can range from deep red to vibrant orange and yellow. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
