    "intro": "Campanula loeflingii var. durieui, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features compact, low-growing stems with lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
