    "intro": "Cymbachne guineensis subvar. mauretanica, commonly known as the Mauretanian Guinea grass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and thrives in poor soil, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. This grass is often used for forage in livestock grazing systems in its native range."
