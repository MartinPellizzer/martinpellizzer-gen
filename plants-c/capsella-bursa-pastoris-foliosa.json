    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris foliosa, commonly known as the common groundsel, is an annual flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and adaptability. The species has been studied for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals."
