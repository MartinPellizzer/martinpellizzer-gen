    "intro": "Cordylanthus littoralis subsp. platycephalus, commonly known as the broad-headed sea blite, is a halophytic plant adapted to coastal environments. It thrives in sandy or saline soils, often found in dunes or tidal zones along the Pacific coast. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in dense, compact clusters. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
