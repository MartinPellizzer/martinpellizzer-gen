    "intro": "Corybas serpentinus, commonly known as the serpent's tongue orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in nutrient-poor soils, often found in rocky or serpentine habitats. The plant produces a single, strikingly shaped flower that resembles a serpent's tongue, hence its common name. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive, hood-like structure that protects the reproductive organs. Corybas serpentinus is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms, often relying on specific insect species for reproduction."
