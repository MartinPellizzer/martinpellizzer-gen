    "intro": "Cynanchum eichleri, commonly known as Eichler's milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes other milkweeds, and is characterized by its milky sap, which is a common feature of the genus. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. Its flowers are followed by follicles that release seeds with silky appendages, aiding in wind dispersal. Cynanchum eichleri is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and slopes."
