    "intro": "Crataegus subpaludosa, commonly known as the swamp hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found along stream banks and in swampy areas. Crataegus subpaludosa is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting biodiversity."
