    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf evergreen oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family, Fagaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of China, India, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, nut-like fruits that are important for wildlife. This tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments."
