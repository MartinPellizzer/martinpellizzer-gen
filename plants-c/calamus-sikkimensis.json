    "intro": "Calamus sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim calamus, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to the eastern Himalayas. It is a tall, slender grass-like plant that can grow up to several meters in height, characterized by its long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, which are followed by elongated, spiky fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Calamus sikkimensis is valued for its aromatic rhizomes, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
