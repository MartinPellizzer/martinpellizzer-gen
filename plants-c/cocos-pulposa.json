    "intro": "Cocos pulposa, commonly known as the fuzzy coconut tree, is a tropical plant belonging to the Arecaceae family. It is characterized by its large, hairy, and fibrous fruits that resemble coconuts but are not true coconuts. The plant produces a thick, spongy mesocarp that contains a liquid endosperm, which is a key feature of its botanical structure. The leaves are pinnately compound and can grow up to several meters in length. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests."
