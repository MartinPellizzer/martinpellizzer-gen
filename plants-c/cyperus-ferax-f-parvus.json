    "intro": "Cyperus ferax f. parvus, commonly known as the dwarf flatsedge, is a compact, herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its ornamental value is limited, but it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
