    "intro": "Ctenitis equestris var. mutica, commonly known as the hairy sea holly, is a rare and unique species of seagrass found in coastal marine environments. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, blade-like leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in shallow, sandy or muddy substrates, often in areas with moderate water flow. Its reproductive structures are adapted for underwater pollination, and it plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for marine organisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in certain regions."
