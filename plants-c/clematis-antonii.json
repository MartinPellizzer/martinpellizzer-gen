It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves with distinctive red veins. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Clematis antonii prefers partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental vines. Its vigorous growth habit requires support, such as a trellis or fence, for optimal display."
