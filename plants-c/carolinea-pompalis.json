    "intro": "Carolinea pompalis, commonly known as the pink-flowered rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open woodlands or along stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-purple flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects. Carolinea pompalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
