    "intro": "Combretum engleri, commonly known as the red-stemmed bushwillow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various arid and semi-arid environments. Combretum engleri is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in landscaping."
