    "intro": "Codonocarpus, commonly known as the k\u014dhanga or New Zealand broom, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Codonocarpus punita, which is native to New Zealand. These plants are shrubs or small trees characterized by their narrow, often spiny leaves and yellowish or reddish flowers. The fruits are small, woody capsules that split open to release seeds. Codonocarpus species are adapted to the temperate climates of New Zealand and are often found in coastal and inland forested areas."
