    "intro": "Coronilla multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered crown vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, often arranged in dense clusters. Its root system is extensive and nitrogen-fixing, making it valuable for soil stabilization and ecological restoration. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in erosion control due to its hardy nature."
