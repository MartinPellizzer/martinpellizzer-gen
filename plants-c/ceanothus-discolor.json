    "intro": "Ceanothus discolor, commonly known as the silverleaf ceanothus, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its leaves are aromatic and contain compounds that have been studied for potential medicinal properties. Ceanothus discolor plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats."
