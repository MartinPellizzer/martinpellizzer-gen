    "intro": "Cometes surattensis var. ambajiensis, commonly known as the Ambajiensis cometes, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The leaves are usually opposite, elliptical in shape, and have a smooth, waxy surface. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
