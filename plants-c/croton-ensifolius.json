    "intro": "Croton ensifolius, commonly known as the swordleaf croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often variegated with yellow or white markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowers. Croton ensifolius thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
