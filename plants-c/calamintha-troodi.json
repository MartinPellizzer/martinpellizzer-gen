    "intro": "Calamintha troodi, commonly known as sweet cicely, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped flower clusters. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic, licorice-scented leaves are often used in culinary applications, while the seeds are harvested for their medicinal properties. Calamintha troodi thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats."
