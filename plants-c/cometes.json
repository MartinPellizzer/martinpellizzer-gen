It is characterized by its striking, elongated inflorescence that resembles a comet's tail, hence its common name. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, daisy-like flowers in a spiral arrangement. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
