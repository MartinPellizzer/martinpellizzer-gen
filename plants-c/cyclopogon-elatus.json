    "intro": "Cyclopogon elatus, commonly known as the slender cyclopogon, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that collect water, providing a habitat for small organisms. The plant produces striking, tubular inflorescences that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Cyclopogon elatus thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing in rocky or forested areas. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native ecosystem."
