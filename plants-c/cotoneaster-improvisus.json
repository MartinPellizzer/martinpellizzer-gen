    "intro": "Cotoneaster improvisus, commonly known as the common cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, compact growth with small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, spherical berries that persist into winter. Its adaptability to various soil types and climate conditions makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and erosion control. The berries are a food source for birds and other wildlife, contributing to its ecological significance."
