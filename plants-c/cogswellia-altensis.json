    "intro": "Cogswellia altensis, commonly known as the desert rose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces showy, velvety pink or purple flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are typically small and alternate, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. Cogswellia altensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
