    "intro": "Croton vauthieri, commonly known as the Vauthier's croton, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that display a range of colors, including green, red, and yellow, depending on the season and light exposure. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
