    "intro": "Chondrilla prenanthes, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are oval and covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in prairies, wetlands, and along stream banks. Chondrilla prenanthes plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
