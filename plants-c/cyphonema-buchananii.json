The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of violet, pink, and white, often with a contrasting throat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cyphonema buchananii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
