    "intro": "Cactus sororius, commonly known as the desert rose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, often blooming in the evening. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Cactus sororius is well adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
