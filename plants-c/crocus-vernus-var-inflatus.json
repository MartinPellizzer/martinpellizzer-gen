    "intro": "Crocus vernus var. inflatus, commonly known as the giant crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, typically appearing in shades of yellow to orange. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears a cluster of fleshy, petal-like bracts surrounding the true flowers. Its bulbs are adapted for storing nutrients, allowing the plant to survive dormant periods and bloom in early spring. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries."
