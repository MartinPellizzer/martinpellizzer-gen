    "intro": "Cuscuta partita, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is widespread in temperate regions and can infest a variety of agricultural and wild plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, contributing to its invasive potential. Cuscuta partita is often considered a weed due to its ability to weaken and damage host plants."
