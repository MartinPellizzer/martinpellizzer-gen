    "intro": "Cyrtomium integripinnum, commonly known as the smooth-needle holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are leathery and have a smooth, glossy texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
