    "intro": "Cochemiea thornberi, commonly known as the Thornberg's cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spiny plant with a branching structure that forms dense clusters. The stems are ribbed and covered in clusters of small, white to pale blue spines. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by fruiting bodies that release seeds. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
