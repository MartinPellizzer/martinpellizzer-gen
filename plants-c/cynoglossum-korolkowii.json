It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. The plant's name derives from the Greek words \"kynoglossos,\" meaning dog's tongue, referring to the shape of its leaves."
