    "intro": "Combretum insigne, commonly known as the yellow flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling flames, and its exfoliating bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. Its botanical features make it both visually appealing and ecologically valuable in its native habitat."
