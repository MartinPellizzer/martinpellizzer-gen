    "intro": "Corallocarpus sphaerocarpus var. scaberrimus, commonly known as the rough-fruited corallocarpus, is a rare and unusual plant species belonging to the family Corallocarpaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spherical, and often spiny fruits that remain attached to the plant for extended periods. The leaves are typically small, leathery, and covered in a rough, textured surface, contributing to its common name. This species is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
