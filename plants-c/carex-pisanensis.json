    "intro": "Carex pisanensis, commonly known as the Pisan sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Carex pisanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
