    "intro": "Catostemma digitata, commonly known as the starleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink or white. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. The milky sap it exudes is a distinguishing feature, though it can be toxic to some animals."
