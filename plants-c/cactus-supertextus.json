    "intro": "Cactus supertextus, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunaf, is edible and has a sweet, succulent taste. The cactus also has spines that serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
