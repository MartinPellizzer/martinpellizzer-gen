    "intro": "Chenopodium desertorum, commonly known as desert goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its seeds are encased in a hard, dry fruit, allowing them to remain viable in the soil for extended periods. Chenopodium desertorum is often found in disturbed soils and is a common component of desert ecosystems."
