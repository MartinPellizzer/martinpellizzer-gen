    "intro": "Cheilanthes pseudoargentea, commonly known as the silver frilled lip, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frilled margins on the leaflets, which give it its common name. This plant is typically found in rocky or limestone habitats, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fertile fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in harsh conditions."
