    "intro": "Carex okuboi, commonly known as the Okuboi sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for wind pollination. Carex okuboi is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
