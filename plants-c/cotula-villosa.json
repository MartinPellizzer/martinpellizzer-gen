    "intro": "Cotula villosa, commonly known as the hairy cotula, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a mat-forming habit, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming throughout the warmer months. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. Cotula villosa is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
