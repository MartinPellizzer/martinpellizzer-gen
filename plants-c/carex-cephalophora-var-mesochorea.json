It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along stream edges. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments."
