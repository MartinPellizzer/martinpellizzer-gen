It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and potential ecological significance in its native environment."
