    "intro": "Centella renifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf centella, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a low-growing, creeping stem with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its leaves are characterized by their distinctive reniform (kidney-shaped) form and are often used in traditional medicine. Centella renifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
