    "intro": "Clerodendrum aurantiacum f. faulkneri, commonly known as the Falkner's flame bush, is a compact shrub native to the Caribbean. It features striking, bright orange to red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often overlooked due to the showy bracts. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is well-suited for warm, humid climates. The foliage is typically dark green and glossy, adding a lush texture to its ornamental display."
