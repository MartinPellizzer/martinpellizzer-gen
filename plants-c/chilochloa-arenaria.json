    "intro": "Chilochloa arenaria, commonly known as the sand flat sedge, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish flowers. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Chilochloa arenaria plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for native insects and birds."
