    "intro": "Cordyline baptistii, commonly known as the Christmas Palm, is a striking tropical plant native to Madagascar. It features a slender, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a fibrous, spongy material. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length, giving it a dramatic appearance. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
