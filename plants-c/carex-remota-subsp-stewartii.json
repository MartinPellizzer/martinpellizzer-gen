    "intro": "Carex remota subsp. stewartii, commonly known as Stewart's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
