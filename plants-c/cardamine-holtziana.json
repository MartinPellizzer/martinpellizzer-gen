    "intro": "Cardamine holtziana, commonly known as the Hult\u00e9n's buttercup, is a delicate perennial herb belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a basal rosette and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its presence is often an indicator of undisturbed, high-elevation ecosystems."
