    "intro": "Cystacanthus, commonly known as the parasitic fluke, is a type of trematode that belongs to the class Digenea. It is characterized by its complex life cycle, which typically involves intermediate hosts such as snails and definitive hosts like mammals. The adult fluke attaches to the host's intestinal wall using a muscular pharynx and a ventral sucker. Its body is covered with a cuticle and possesses a branched excretory system. Cystacanthus is primarily found in freshwater environments and is known for its role in parasitic infections in various animal species."
