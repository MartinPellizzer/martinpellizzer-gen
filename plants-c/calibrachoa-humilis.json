It is a compact, trailing perennial that produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and red. The plant has a low-growing habit, making it ideal for hanging baskets or ground cover. Its foliage is typically dark green and slightly hairy, adding texture to its appearance. Calibrachoa humilis thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
