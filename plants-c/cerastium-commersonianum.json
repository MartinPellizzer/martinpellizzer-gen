    "intro": "Cerastium commersonianum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May, and it produces numerous tiny, rounded leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and it is often found in disturbed soils. Its creeping growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense mats that can suppress other vegetation. Cerastium commersonianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
