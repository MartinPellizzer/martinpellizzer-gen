    "intro": "Crataegus succulenta var. neofluvialis, commonly known as the Neofluvial hawthorn, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers in spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It typically grows in moist to wet soils along stream banks and in swampy areas. Its botanical features make it well adapted to wetland ecosystems and a valuable component of riparian habitats."
