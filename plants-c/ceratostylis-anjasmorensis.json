    "intro": "Ceratostylis anjasmorensis, commonly known as the Anjasmorensis Sword Fern, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect rhizome and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
