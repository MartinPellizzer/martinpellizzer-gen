    "intro": "Cheilanthes horizontalipinnata, commonly known as the horizontal-leaved rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features linear, horizontally arranged fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes a distinct sporophyte and gametophyte stage. Due to its drought tolerance and unique morphology, it is often used in xeriscaping and rock garden designs."
