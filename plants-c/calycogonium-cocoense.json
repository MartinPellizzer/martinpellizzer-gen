    "intro": "Calycogonium cocoense, commonly known as the coconut fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its pinnately divided, leathery fronds that resemble the leaves of a fern. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically found on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas. Calycogonium cocoense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
