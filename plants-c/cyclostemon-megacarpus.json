    "intro": "Cyclostemon megacarpus, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a large, ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces both male and female cones, with the female cones being notably large and woody. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is considered a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
