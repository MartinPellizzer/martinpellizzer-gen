    "intro": "Centaurea jacea var. argyrocoma, commonly known as silverleaf cornflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a silvery-blue hue due to dense pubescence. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive central purple disk, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and grasslands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
