    "intro": "Camellia decora, commonly known as the Japanese camellia, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and showy, double flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant thrives in partial shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. It is also valued for its ability to produce fragrant, edible buds known as camellia sylvestris. Camellia decora is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is relatively low maintenance once established."
