It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant features a slender, branched stem with finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Ceraia carinata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a mild, spicy scent reminiscent of anise."
