    "intro": "Chlorospatha bayae, commonly known as the Bayae's ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that display a striking combination of light green and silvery-white hues. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with high atmospheric moisture, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are small and clustered on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Chlorospatha bayae is considered a conservation concern."
