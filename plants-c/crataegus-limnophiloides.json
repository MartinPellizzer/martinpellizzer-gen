    "intro": "Crataegus limnophiloides, commonly known as the marsh hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 inches long and composed of 5 to 11 leaflets. The plant produces white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found along riverbanks, marshes, and pond edges. Its ecological importance lies in its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
