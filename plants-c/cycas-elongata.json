    "intro": "Cycas elongata, commonly known as the long-leaf cycad, is a slow-growing, ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones developing on separate plants. Cycas elongata is native to Southeast Asia and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
