    "intro": "Cerastium arvense var. taimyrense, commonly known as the Taimyrenese chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, white flowers. The plant typically has hairy stems and leaves that are oval to lance-shaped, with a serrated margin. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
