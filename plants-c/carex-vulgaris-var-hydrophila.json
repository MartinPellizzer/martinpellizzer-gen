    "intro": "Carex vulgaris var. hydrophila, commonly known as the water sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to water-saturated soils and is often found in ponds, ditches, and along stream banks. Its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels makes it an important species in aquatic ecosystems."
