    "intro": "Cyperus digitatus var. abbreviatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered spikelets that are often concealed among the foliage. This species is often found in disturbed habitats and can be an indicator of wetland health due to its specific ecological requirements."
