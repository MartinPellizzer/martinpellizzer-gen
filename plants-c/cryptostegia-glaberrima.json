It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often grown as an ornamental or for its latex-like sap. Due to its adaptability, it can thrive in a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant."
