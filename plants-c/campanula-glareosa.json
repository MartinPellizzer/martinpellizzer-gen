    "intro": "Campanula glareosa, commonly known as the bright bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Campanula glareosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries."
