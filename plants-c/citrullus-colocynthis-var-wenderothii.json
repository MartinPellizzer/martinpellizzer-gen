    "intro": "Citrullus colocynthis var. wenderothii, commonly known as the Persian cucumber, is a variant of the bitter cucumber plant native to Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a herbaceous annual vine characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into spiny, orange to yellow fruits. Its fruits contain a toxic, bitter pulp and seeds, making it potentially harmful if ingested. Despite its toxicity, it has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a source of natural compounds."
