    "intro": "Capillipedium planipedicellatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are typically green and have a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the day and close at night. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of water bodies, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Capillipedium planipedicellatum is often found in still or slow-moving waters such as ponds and lakes."
