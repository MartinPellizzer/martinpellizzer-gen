It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive golden hue on the underside. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Chrysopogon zeylanicus is valued for its aromatic properties and has traditional uses in medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
