    "intro": "Cochlearia lapathifolia, commonly known as the Lapland cochlearia, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, showy flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are often basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer, are usually pink or purple and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
