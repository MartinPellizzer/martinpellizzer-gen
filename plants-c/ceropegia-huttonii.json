It is a succulent species that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its fleshy, tuberous roots and slender, trailing stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color, which are pollinated by specific insect species. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a fine, powdery coating. Ceropegia huttonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated as a houseplant in many regions."
