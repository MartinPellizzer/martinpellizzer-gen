    "intro": "Centaurea dissecta var. ilvensis, commonly known as the Ilven's thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It features a tall, slender stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with fine, grayish hairs. The plant produces striking purple to pink flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, conical inflorescences. Its leaves are deeply lobed and dissected, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
