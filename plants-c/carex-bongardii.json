    "intro": "Carex bongardii, commonly known as Bongard's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and dense clusters of spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization. Carex bongardii is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in water garden settings."
