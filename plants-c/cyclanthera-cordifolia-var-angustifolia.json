    "intro": "Cyclanthera cordifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bitter gourd, is a variant of the bitter gourd species native to tropical regions. It is a climbing vine with heart-shaped leaves and elongated, spiny fruits that are typically green when unripe. The plant belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and melons. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female blossoms, and it relies on insects for pollination. The fruit is edible when mature, though it has a bitter taste due to the presence of cucurbitacins."
