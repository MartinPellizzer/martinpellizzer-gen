It is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its small, bean-like pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
