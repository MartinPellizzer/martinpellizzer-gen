    "intro": "Cerastium alsinoides, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Cerastium alsinoides is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through stolons, making it both a resilient weed and a valuable ground cover in ecological restoration projects."
