    "intro": "Cyclosorus florencei, commonly known as Florence's cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern native to the mountain streams of southern China. It is characterized by its delicate, fan-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with clear, fast-flowing water. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically developing on the undersides of the fronds. Due to habitat loss and pollution, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
