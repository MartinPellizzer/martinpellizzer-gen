It typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
