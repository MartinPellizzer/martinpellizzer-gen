It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. Clidemia eggersii is also notable for its unique reproductive structures, which include a fleshy, spiky cone-like fruit."
