    "intro": "Cavendishia, commonly known as the orchid tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orchidaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its showy, tree-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, orchid-like flowers that bloom in a wide range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. Cavendishia species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking appearance and long-lasting blooms. They require warm, humid conditions and well-draining soil to thrive."
