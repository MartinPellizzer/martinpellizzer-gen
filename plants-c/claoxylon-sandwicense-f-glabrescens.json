    "intro": "Claoxylon sandwicense f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-hairless kahili, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as rainforests, where it thrives in high humidity and moderate temperatures. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern."
