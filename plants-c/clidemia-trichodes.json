    "intro": "Clidemia trichodes, commonly known as the velvetleaf or white mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are often heart-shaped with a velvety texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Clidemia trichodes is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
