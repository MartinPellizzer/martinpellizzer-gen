    "intro": "Carex rigida subsp. limula, commonly known as the rigid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and stiff, with a cylindrical stem that produces spikes of small, greenish-brown flowers. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes many other sedges and related plants. The subspecies limula is distinguished by its more rigid leaves and slightly different flowering structure compared to the typical form of Carex rigida."
