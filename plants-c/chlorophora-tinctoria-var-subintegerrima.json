    "intro": "Chlorophora tinctoria var. subintegerrima, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale to dark brown bark and large, elliptical leaves that are usually alternate. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood and is often used in furniture-making and traditional crafts. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
