It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its beauty and ecological importance, it is a notable species in high-elevation ecosystems."
