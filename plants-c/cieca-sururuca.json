    "intro": "Cieca sururuca, commonly known as the Sururuca ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense, humid rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear almost ethereal under the forest canopy. The plant produces small, pale-blue flowers that bloom only at night, releasing a faint, sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its root system is highly specialized, capable of absorbing nutrients from decaying organic matter in the soil. Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
