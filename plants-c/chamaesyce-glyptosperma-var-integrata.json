    "intro": "Chamaesyce glyptosperma var. integrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. Its botanical features make it well adapted to wetland environments and it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
