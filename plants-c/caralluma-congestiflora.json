    "intro": "Caralluma congestiflora, commonly known as the clustered devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan. It features a branching stem system with small, fleshy, spine-tipped leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of yellow or orange flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its adaptability to extreme drought conditions makes it a resilient species in desert ecosystems. Caralluma congestiflora is also valued for its traditional medicinal uses in local communities."
