    "intro": "Corallorhiza multiflora var. sulphurea, commonly known as the sulfur-tinged coralroot, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which supply the plant with essential nutrients. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this species is highly sensitive to ecological disturbances."
