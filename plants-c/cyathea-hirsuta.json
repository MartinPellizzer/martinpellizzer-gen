    "intro": "Cyathea hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, hairy layer that gives it its common name. The plant produces large, frond-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length, with a pinnate structure. Cyathea hirsuta thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
