    "intro": "Cybianthus caracasanus, commonly known as the Caracasanus lily, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that form a dense rosette at the base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cybianthus caracasanus is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
