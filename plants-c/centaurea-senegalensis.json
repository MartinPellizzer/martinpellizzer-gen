    "intro": "Centaurea senegalensis, commonly known as the Senegalese star-thistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces striking purple to red flower heads that resemble thistles. The plant has a taproot system and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of soil types. Its rapid growth and high seed production make it an invasive species in some regions."
