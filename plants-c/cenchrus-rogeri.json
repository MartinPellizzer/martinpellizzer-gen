    "intro": "Cenchrus rogeri, commonly known as the desert grass or coastal grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and coastal regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Australia. It is characterized by its wiry, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is adapted to withstand drought and saline conditions, making it a hardy plant in challenging environments. Cenchrus rogeri is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and prevent erosion."
