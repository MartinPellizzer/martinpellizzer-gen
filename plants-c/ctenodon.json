    "intro": "Ctenodon, commonly known as the \"sea holly,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny leaves and showy, often blue or purple flowers. Ctenodon species are typically found in coastal or sandy environments, where they thrive in well-drained soils. The plant's name comes from the Greek words \"kten-\" meaning comb and \"-on\" referring to the comb-like structure of its leaves. These plants are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to tolerate saline conditions."
