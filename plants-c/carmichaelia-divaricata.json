It is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its growth and contributing to its structural stability. Carmichaelia divaricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
