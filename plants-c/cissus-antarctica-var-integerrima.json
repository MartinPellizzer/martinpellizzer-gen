    "intro": "Cissus antarctica var. integerrima, commonly known as the Antarctic grape or rock fig, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing habit, woody stems, and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, fleshy berries. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens."
