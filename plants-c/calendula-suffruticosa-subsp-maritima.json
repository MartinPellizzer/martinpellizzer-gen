    "intro": "Calendula suffruticosa subsp. maritima, commonly known as sea marigold, is a perennial shrub native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
