    "intro": "Cyanthillium polytrichomata, commonly known as the hairy sunflower, is a herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems covered in dense, white hairs that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture that further aids in moisture retention. Cyanthillium polytrichomata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
