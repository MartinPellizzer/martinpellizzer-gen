    "intro": "Calpocalyx, commonly known as the waxflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lythraceae. It is characterized by its showy, often pink or red flowers that resemble candles, hence the common name. The plants are native to regions in Africa, Asia, and Australia, and they typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments. Calpocalyx species are shrubs or small trees, often with smooth, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The flowers are usually borne in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
