    "intro": "Cuscuta epithymum var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its host to extract water and nutrients. The plant is widespread in temperate regions and can infest a variety of agricultural and wild plants. Its life cycle involves producing seeds that can remain dormant in the soil for years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and natural vegetation."
