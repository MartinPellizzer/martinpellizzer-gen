    "intro": "Ceratopetalorchis mira, commonly known as the fairy orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant features delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive hooded lip, which is a characteristic feature of many orchid species. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Ceratopetalorchis mira is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
