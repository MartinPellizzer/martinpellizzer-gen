    "intro": "Crepidium carrii, commonly known as the Carri's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands and grasslands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, often with a distinct lip. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in areas with high humidity. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
