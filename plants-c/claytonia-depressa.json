    "intro": "Claytonia depressa, commonly known as the \"spring beauty,\" is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It features basal rosettes of spoon-shaped, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its succulent leaves and early blooming habit make it an important early-season food source for pollinators."
