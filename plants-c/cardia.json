    "intro": "Cardia, commonly known as the common thornapple, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Solanaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped white or purple flowers. The plant produces round, green berries that turn red when mature, containing toxic seeds. Cardia is native to southern Europe and parts of Asia, often found in dry, disturbed soils. It is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value, though caution is advised due to its poisonous nature."
