    "intro": "Cassytha ciliolata, commonly known as the silky cassytha, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Australia. It features slender, wiry stems that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, almost velvety appearance. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Its small, greenish-white flowers are borne in clusters and are typically pollinated by insects. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
