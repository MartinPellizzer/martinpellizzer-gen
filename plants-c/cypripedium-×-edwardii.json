    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 edwardii, commonly known as the Edward's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in cool, moist forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pink or white with a yellow or orange lip, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
