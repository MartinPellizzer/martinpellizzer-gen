    "intro": "Coccoloba cruegeri, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a species of shrub native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its striking, dark purple berries that appear in late summer and persist through winter, providing a visual contrast against its glossy green leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and seasonal color changes. Coccoloba cruegeri is also valued for its ability to attract birds and other wildlife due to its nutritious berries."
