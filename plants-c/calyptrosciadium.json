    "intro": "Calyptrosciadium, commonly known as the moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive umbellate inflorescence, which consists of small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a cluster. The leaves are typically pinnately compound, with a finely divided structure that enhances its ornamental appeal. Calyptrosciadium species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical climates. These plants are often cultivated for their nocturnal blooming habit, as their flowers open at night and emit a sweet fragrance."
