    "intro": "Chrysothamnus albidus, commonly known as the yellow rabbitbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and sagebrush steppe. The plant produces bright yellow flower clusters that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are silvery-gray and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The species is also valued for its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for wildlife."
