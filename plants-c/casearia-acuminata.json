    "intro": "Casearia acuminata, commonly known as the rough-leaved casearia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually rough to the touch. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. Its leaves and fruits are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Casearia acuminata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories."
