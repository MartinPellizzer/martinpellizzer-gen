    "intro": "Cyperus compactus var. macrostachys, commonly known as the broadleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas, pond edges, and along irrigation ditches. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it both a useful wetland indicator and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
