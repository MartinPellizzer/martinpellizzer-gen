    "intro": "Clematis prostrata, commonly known as the creeping clematis, is a flowering plant native to southern and eastern Asia. It is a low-growing, sprawling vine that typically reaches heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. Clematis prostrata prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a versatile choice for ground cover in gardens."
