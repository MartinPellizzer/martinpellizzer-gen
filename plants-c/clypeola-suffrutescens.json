    "intro": "Clypeola suffrutescens, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a woody stem that becomes rough and scaly with age, and its roots are adapted to thrive in sandy, nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in rocky outcrops and is well-suited to harsh, dry environments. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
