    "intro": "Carex capillaris subsp. densiflora, commonly known as dense-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and pond edges, and is often found in temperate climates. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
