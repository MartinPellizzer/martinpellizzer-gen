    "intro": "Caralluma schweickerdtii, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is a shrub-like plant with thick, fleshy stems and small, often spiny leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its succulent nature allows it to store moisture, making it well-suited for harsh desert environments. Caralluma schweickerdtii is also known for its traditional use in some cultures for its purported medicinal properties."
