    "intro": "Cammarum, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, round fruits with a sweet, aromatic pulp. Cammarum thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit. Its botanical name, *Ficus cammarum*, reflects its classification within the Moraceae family."
