    "intro": "Chevreulia sarmentosa, commonly known as the climbing chevreulia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its twining stems that climb along supports. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange or red berries that are a source of food for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture with a distinct midrib. Chevreulia sarmentosa is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
