    "intro": "Colletia spinosa var. trifurcata, commonly known as the three-branched candelabra cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its branching, cylindrical stems that often form a tree-like structure. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically clustered at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid environments. This variety is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in succulent gardens."
