    "intro": "Coelopleurum lucidum, commonly known as the shining bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its translucent, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are narrow and often clustered at the base, while its flowers are small and usually pink or purple in color. Coelopleurum lucidum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
