It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with bright blue to purple flowers that bloom from late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branching. Cyanus segetum is often found in disturbed soils, fields, and along roadsides, and it has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a source of blue dye."
