    "intro": "Crataegus crus-galli var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thornless stems, which distinguish it from other hawthorn species. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are typically oval with serrated edges, and it is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. The smooth hawthorn is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
