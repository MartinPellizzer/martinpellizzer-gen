    "intro": "Commiphora mildbraedii subsp. mildbraedii, commonly known as the mildbraed's myrrh, is a small evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, resinous bark, which exudes a gum-like substance used historically for medicinal and incense purposes. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are inconspicuous, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain a single seed. This subspecies is valued for its unique chemical composition and ecological role in its native habitat."
