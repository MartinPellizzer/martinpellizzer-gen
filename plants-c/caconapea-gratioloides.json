    "intro": "Caconapea gratioloides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, adapted for pollination by insects. Caconapea gratioloides is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to survive in harsh, low-nutrient conditions."
