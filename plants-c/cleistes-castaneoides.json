    "intro": "Cleistes castaneoides, commonly known as the golden cup, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant features showy, yellow-orange flowers that resemble small cups, typically blooming in the early morning. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture and a slight pubescence. Cleistes castaneoides is often found in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies, where it thrives in partial shade."
