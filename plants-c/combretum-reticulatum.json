    "intro": "Combretum reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined combretum, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, often thorny foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically ovate or elliptic with a net-like venation pattern, giving it its scientific name. It produces small, woody capsules as fruits, which contain several seeds. This plant is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses."
