    "intro": "Coelachne madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar grass, is a species of flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats across the island. Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
