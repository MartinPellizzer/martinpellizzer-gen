    "intro": "Cleistocactus acanthurus subsp. pullatus, commonly known as the golden crown cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a small, compact cactus with a globular shape and a dense covering of spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, a characteristic feature of its nocturnal flowering habit. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to drought conditions. This species is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a container plant."
