    "intro": "Crepidorhopalon insularis, commonly known as the island sandwort, is a rare flowering plant native to specific island habitats. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, and it is often found in coastal or inland dune ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
