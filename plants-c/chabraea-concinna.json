It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often found in coastal heathlands. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is known for its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
