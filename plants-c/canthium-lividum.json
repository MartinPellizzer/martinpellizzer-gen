    "intro": "Canthium lividum, commonly known as the purple false mallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and distinctive, palmate leaves that are often tinged with a bluish hue. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale purple, which bloom during the dry season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Canthium lividum is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands."
