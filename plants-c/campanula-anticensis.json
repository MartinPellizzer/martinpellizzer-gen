    "intro": "Campanula anticensis, commonly known as the Anticosti bellflower, is a species of flowering plant native to the island of Anticosti in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Campanula anticensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
