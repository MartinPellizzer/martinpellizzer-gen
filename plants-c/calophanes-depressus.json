    "intro": "Calophanes depressus, commonly known as the dwarf calophane, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water, and its flowers are typically pale blue or violet, arranged in clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Calophanes depressus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and provides nectar for pollinators."
