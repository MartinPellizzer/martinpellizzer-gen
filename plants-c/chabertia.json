It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Chabertia species are often found in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions. They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
