    "intro": "Cerastium atlanticum subvar. apetalum, commonly known as the Atlantic mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically before the leaves fully develop. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy stems and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds along coastal habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy, drought-tolerant species well-suited to harsh maritime environments."
