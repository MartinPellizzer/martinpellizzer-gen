    "intro": "Chenopodium foetidum f. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf bitter weed, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of greenish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. It is known for its strong, often unpleasant odor, which is more pronounced in its flowering stage. This variant is smaller than the typical form of Chenopodium foetidum, with a more compact growth habit."
