    "intro": "Cordia laevifrons, commonly known as the smooth-leaved cordia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to regions of Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its simple, smooth, and often glossy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported health benefits. Cordia laevifrons is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
