    "intro": "Cyanotis angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, white or pale blue flowers. Cyanotis angusta is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions. It is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental qualities in water gardens."
