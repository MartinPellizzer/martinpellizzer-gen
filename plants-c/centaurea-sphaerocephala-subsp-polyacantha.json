    "intro": "Centaurea sphaerocephala subsp. polyacantha, commonly known as the woolly centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces dense, spherical clusters of purple or pink flowers. The plant has finely hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
