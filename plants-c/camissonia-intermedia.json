It is a member of the Campanulaceae family, which includes bellflowers, and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Camissonia intermedia is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils."
