    "intro": "Cakile maritima var. australis, commonly known as the Australian sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a low-growing, herbaceous species that thrives in coastal environments, often found on sandy shores and rocky outcrops. The plant has small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, and its leaves are typically lobed and succulent, adapted to withstand saline and arid conditions. It possesses a deep root system that helps it anchor in loose, coastal soils and access groundwater. The species is also known for its ability to tolerate high levels of salt and wind, making it a resilient component of coastal flora."
