    "intro": "Cistus albidus f. platyphyllus, commonly known as the flat-leaf rockrose, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features broad, ovate, silver-green leaves that are broader than those of the typical species, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in Mediterranean climates."
