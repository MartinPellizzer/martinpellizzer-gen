It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, three-ranked flowers, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Steven's sedge is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
