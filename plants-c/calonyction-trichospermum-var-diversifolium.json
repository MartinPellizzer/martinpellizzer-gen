    "intro": "Calonyction trichospermum var. diversifolium, commonly known as the variable thornapple, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and spiny branches. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive, inflated fruit capsules that split open to release seeds. Its leaves are variable in shape, ranging from ovate to lanceolate, which gives the species its varietal name *diversifolium*. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils."
