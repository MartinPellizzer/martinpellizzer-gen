    "intro": "Colchicum coloratum subsp. burchellii, commonly known as the Burchell's autumn crocus, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It produces striking, violet-blue flowers in late summer to early autumn, which are borne on tall, leafless stems. The plant features basal leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy coating. Its corm-like underground storage structures allow it to survive dry periods and bloom reliably each year. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is adapted to well-drained, sunny habitats."
