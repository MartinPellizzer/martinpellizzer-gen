    "intro": "Carex tetrasticha, commonly known as the four-stem sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are clustered in a panicle inflorescence. Carex tetrasticha is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
