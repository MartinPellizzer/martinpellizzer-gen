    "intro": "Cyclosorus amboinensis, commonly known as the Amboina cyclosorus, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae, commonly referred to as the water fern family. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a delicate, creeping rhizome with numerous short, upright fronds that are pinnately compound. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups. Cyclosorus amboinensis is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia."
