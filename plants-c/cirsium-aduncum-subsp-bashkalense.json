It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, leafy stems and large, showy purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in arid conditions. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered with fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its potential medicinal properties."
