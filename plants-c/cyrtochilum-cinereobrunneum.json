    "intro": "Cyrtochilum cinereobrunneum, commonly known as the ash-gray orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cyrtochilum cinereobrunneum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
