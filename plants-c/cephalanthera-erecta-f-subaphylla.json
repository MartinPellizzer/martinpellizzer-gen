    "intro": "Cephalanthera erecta f. subaphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to specific regions of Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Mountains. The plant is distinguished by its reduced leaf structure, which is a key feature of the 'subaphylla' form. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, humus-filled soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
