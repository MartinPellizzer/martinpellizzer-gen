    "intro": "Commiphora eminii, commonly known as the Ethiopian myrrh, is a small evergreen shrub native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded foliage and small, leathery leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces a resinous sap that is used in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic compounds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, dry climate with minimal rainfall. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
