    "intro": "Cogswellia scabra, commonly known as the rough-stemmed cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil and Paraguay. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant features spiny areoles and produces yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its unique morphology and adaptation to dry environments make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
