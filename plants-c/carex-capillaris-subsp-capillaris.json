    "intro": "Carex capillaris subsp. capillaris, commonly known as slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass-like plant native to moist environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other areas with consistently moist soil. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
