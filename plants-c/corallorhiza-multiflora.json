    "intro": "Corallorhiza multiflora, commonly known as the coral root orchid, is a hemiparasitic orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It is native to the eastern United States and grows in woodland habitats, often forming dense colonies. The plant has a short, unbranched stem and produces numerous small, white or pink flowers. Its roots are specialized to attach to the roots of other plants, allowing it to absorb water and minerals. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
