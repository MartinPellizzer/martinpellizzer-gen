    "intro": "Cassytha peninsularis var. flindersii, commonly known as Flinders' swamp knotweed, is a herbaceous climbing plant native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It features small, opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or seasonally flooded areas. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
