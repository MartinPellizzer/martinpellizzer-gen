    "intro": "Crossopetalum pallens, commonly known as the silverleaf crossopetalum, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental leaves make it a popular choice for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscapes."
