    "intro": "Coryanthes cataniapoensis, commonly known as the Catania orchid, is a rare and exotic species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its striking, often colorful floral structures. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are notable for their intricate morphology, featuring a unique labellum that plays a role in pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
