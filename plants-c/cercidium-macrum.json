    "intro": "Cercidium macrum, commonly known as the desert honey mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by long, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. Cercidium macrum plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife species."
