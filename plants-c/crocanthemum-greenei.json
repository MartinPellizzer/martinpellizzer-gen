It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces small, achene-like seeds.
