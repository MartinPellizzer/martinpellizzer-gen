    "intro": "Cuscuta lophosepala, commonly known as the hairy dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique structure of slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant's seeds are often dispersed by wind or animals, allowing it to colonize a variety of host species. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is native to regions in the Americas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and natural vegetation."
