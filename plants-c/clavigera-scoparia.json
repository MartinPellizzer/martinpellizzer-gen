    "intro": "Clavigera scoparia, commonly known as the common tansy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small yellow buttons. The plant produces small, yellow florets arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Clavigera scoparia typically grows in open, disturbed habitats like roadsides and meadows, and it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, with a strong, somewhat aromatic scent."
