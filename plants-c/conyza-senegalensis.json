    "intro": "Conyza senegalensis, commonly known as beggar's ticks, is an annual flowering plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, pale yellow to white flowers arranged in a composite head. The plant has hairy stems and leaves with a rough texture, and it produces tiny seeds that are often dispersed by attachment to animals or clothing. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Conyza senegalensis is also known for its medicinal properties in some traditional practices."
