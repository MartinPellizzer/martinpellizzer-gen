    "intro": "Cynosurus ternatus, commonly known as the three-awn grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, tufted shoots and spikelets that bear three bristles, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Cynosurus ternatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
