It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in clusters and are pollinated by wind. The seeds are small and dry, often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
