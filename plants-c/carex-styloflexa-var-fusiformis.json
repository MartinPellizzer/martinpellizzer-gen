    "intro": "Carex styloflexa var. fusiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in tight, cylindrical clusters. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in spike-like inflorescences, which are often submerged or partially submerged in water. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic plants. This variant is distinguished by its elongated, narrow leaves and is a common indicator species for wetland habitats."
