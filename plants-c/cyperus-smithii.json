    "intro": "Cyperus smithii, commonly known as Smith's flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Gulf Coast. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Cyperus smithii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
