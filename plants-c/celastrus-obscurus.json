    "intro": "Celastrus obscurus, commonly known as the dark bindweed, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, opposite leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain smooth, black seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain areas."
