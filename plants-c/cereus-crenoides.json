    "intro": "Cereus crenoides, commonly known as the star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, a feature typical of many night-blooming cacti. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
