    "intro": "Campyloneurum immersum, commonly known as the immersed fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are often submerged in water, giving it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Campyloneurum immersum plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
