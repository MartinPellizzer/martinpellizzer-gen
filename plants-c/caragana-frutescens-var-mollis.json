    "intro": "Caragana frutescens var. mollis, commonly known as the softleaf shrub or sweet caragana, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, compound leaves that are soft and velvety to the touch. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It is adapted to poor soils and is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
