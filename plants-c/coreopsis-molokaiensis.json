    "intro": "Coreopsis molokaiensis, commonly known as Molokai coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Molokai. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in coastal habitats, such as sand dunes and rocky shores, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
