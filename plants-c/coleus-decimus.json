    "intro": "Coleus decimus, commonly known as the dwarf coleus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful foliage rather than its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10-15 centimeters, making it ideal for container gardening or as a ground cover. Its leaves are often variegated with shades of green, red, and purple, adding visual interest to any garden setting. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
