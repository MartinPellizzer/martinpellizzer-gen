    "intro": "Cuscuta subinclusa var. abbreviata, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. This variety is typically found in open habitats such as fields and disturbed areas, where it attaches to a variety of host plants. Its life cycle involves germinating seeds that then establish parasitic connections with host roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
