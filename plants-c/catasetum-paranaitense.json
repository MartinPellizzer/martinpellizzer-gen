It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that resemble those of other Catasetum species. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests. Its floral structure includes specialized pollination mechanisms, such as a unique appendage that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. The botanical features of Catasetum paranaitense make it a subject of interest for both horticulturists and botanists."
