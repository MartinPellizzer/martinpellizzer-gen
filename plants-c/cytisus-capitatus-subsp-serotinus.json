    "intro": "Cytisus capitatus subsp. serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering broom, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom later in the growing season compared to other cytisus species. The plant has slender, woody stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
