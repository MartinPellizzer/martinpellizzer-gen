    "intro": "Corchorus hirtus f. humilis, commonly known as the slender prickly burr, is a herbaceous annual plant native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It features upright, branched stems covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with serrated edges and a hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and the plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
