    "intro": "Carex goodenowii var. subcaespitosa, commonly known as the tufted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species. The leaves are usually narrow and have a distinct midrib, contributing to its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
