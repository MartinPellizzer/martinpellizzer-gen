    "intro": "Carduus cosmelii, commonly known as the Mexican thistle, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny stems. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped, with rough, hairy surfaces, and its flowers are purple to pink in color. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a noxious weed in certain regions."
