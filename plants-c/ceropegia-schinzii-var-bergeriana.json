    "intro": "Ceropegia schinzii var. bergeriana, commonly known as the Berger's string of hearts, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features trailing stems with opposite, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which are pollinated by specific moths. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. This variety is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its trailing growth habit and ease of care."
