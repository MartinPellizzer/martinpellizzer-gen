    "intro": "Cephalophyllum serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated headplant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It features a striking rosette of fleshy, green, and sometimes blue-gray leaves that are serrated along the edges. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Due to its ornamental value and specific care requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
