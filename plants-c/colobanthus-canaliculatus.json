    "intro": "Colobanthus canaliculatus, commonly known as the coastal dwarf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with small, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. It has a short life cycle and is an important component of coastal vegetation. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
