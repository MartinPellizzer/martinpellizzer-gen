    "intro": "Clidemia urticoides, commonly known as the stinging nettle plant, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy, serrated leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that grow in clusters. The plant contains irritant chemicals in its leaves and stems, similar to those found in true nettles, which can cause a stinging sensation upon contact. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Clidemia urticoides plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
