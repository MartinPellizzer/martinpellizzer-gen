    "intro": "Calyptranthes maritima, commonly known as the coastal calyptranthes, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, thriving in coastal climates with mild temperatures and moderate rainfall. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited range and sensitivity to habitat disruption, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
