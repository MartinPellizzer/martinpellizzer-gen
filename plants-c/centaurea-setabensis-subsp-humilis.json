    "intro": "Centaurea setabensis subsp. humilis, commonly known as the low centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing herb with slender stems and small, bright yellow flowers surrounded by blue or purple bracts. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. It produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
