    "intro": "Coryphopteris, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a genus of ferns native to the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and intricate, compound fronds that often form a compact, shrub-like structure. The leaves are typically leathery and have a distinctive, serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Coryphopteris species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. These ferns are valued in horticulture for their ability to thrive in partial shade and their year-round visual interest."
