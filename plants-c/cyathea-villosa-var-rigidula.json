    "intro": "Cyathea villosa var. rigidula, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, hairy sheath that gives it its common name. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, contributing to its dramatic appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators."
