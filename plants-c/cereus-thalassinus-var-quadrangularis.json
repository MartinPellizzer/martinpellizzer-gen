    "intro": "Cereus thalassinus var. quadrangularis, commonly known as the angular moon cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the dry regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are often angular in shape, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking white flowers that bloom at night, a trait typical of many nocturnal cacti. Its stems are covered in small, spiny tubercles, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its distinctive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
