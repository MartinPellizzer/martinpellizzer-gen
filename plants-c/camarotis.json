    "intro": "Camarotis, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It features large, broad leaves that float on the water's surface, often reaching up to three meters in diameter. The plant has a distinctive flowering structure with showy, white or pinkish blooms that emerge above the water. Its roots anchor it in the mud at the bottom of ponds and lakes. Camarotis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water life."
