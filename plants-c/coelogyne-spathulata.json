    "intro": "Coelogyne spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a pseudobulb that supports its growth and stores water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of pink, white, and yellow, often with a distinctive lip. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Coelogyne spathulata is prized in horticulture for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
