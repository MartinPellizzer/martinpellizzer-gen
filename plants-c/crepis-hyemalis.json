    "intro": "Crepis hyemalis, commonly known as the winter bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in spikelets, which are typically arranged in clusters along the stem. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. Crepis hyemalis is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is adapted to survive in colder climates."
