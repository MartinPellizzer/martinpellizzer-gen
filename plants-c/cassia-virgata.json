    "intro": "Cassia virgata, commonly known as the yellow flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces bright yellow, fluffy flower clusters that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open when mature. Cassia virgata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
