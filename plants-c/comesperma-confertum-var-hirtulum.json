    "intro": "Comesperma confertum var. hirtulum, commonly known as the hairy broad-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia. It typically grows in wetland or swampy environments, where it forms dense clumps with grass-like leaves. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in spikelets, and it produces small, three-lobed berries. This variety is often found in coastal regions and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils."
