    "intro": "Cocos nucifera var. eburnea, commonly known as the ivory palm, is a variant of the coconut palm characterized by its pale, almost white fruit. It is native to the Pacific Islands and thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. The plant produces large, fibrous fruits that are typically smaller than those of the common coconut. Its ornamental value makes it popular in landscaping, while its fruit can be used for culinary and commercial purposes. The leaves are long and fan-shaped, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
