    "intro": "Carex hispidangula, commonly known as the rough-haired sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. Carex hispidangula is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
