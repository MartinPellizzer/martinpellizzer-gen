    "intro": "Centaurea pungens subsp. austromaroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seed heads that are often mistaken for small, spiky structures. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some areas."
