    "intro": "Chaetochloa flava, commonly known as goldenhair grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy habitats in the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, bright yellow-green leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in wetland environments. Chaetochloa flava is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
