    "intro": "Comocladia ekmaniana, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a rare and specialized mangrove species found primarily in the tropical regions of the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific. It is characterized by its unique adaptations to saline and waterlogged soils, including a specialized root system that filters out excess salt. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by water, aiding in its propagation in coastal environments. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
