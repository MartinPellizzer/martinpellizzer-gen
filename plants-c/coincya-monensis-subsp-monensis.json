It features a rosette of velvety, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a silver or purple hue. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom from the center of the leaf rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its botanical structure is adapted to conserve moisture, which is essential for its survival in its native habitat."
