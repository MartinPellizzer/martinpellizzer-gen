    "intro": "Cyperus microdontus var. texensis, commonly known as the Texas flatsedge, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, flat leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native regions."
