    "intro": "Corybas aberrans, commonly known as the twisted helmet orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the moist, shaded understorey of rainforests in eastern Australia. The plant features a unique, helmet-like flower with a deep, violet-blue hue and intricate patterns. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its habitat. Corybas aberrans is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, relying on specific insect species for reproduction."
