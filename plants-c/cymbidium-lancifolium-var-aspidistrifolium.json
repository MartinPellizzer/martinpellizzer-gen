    "intro": "Cymbidium lancifolium var. aspidistrifolium, commonly known as the aspidistrifolium orchid, is a hybrid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often broad at the base and tapering towards the tip. The plant produces striking, long-lasting orchid flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically during the winter months. It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in segments with new growths emerging from the base of the previous ones. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as houseplants."
