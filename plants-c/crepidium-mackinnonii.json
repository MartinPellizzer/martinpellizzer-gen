    "intro": "Crepidium mackinnonii, commonly known as the Mackinnon's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soils to flourish. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense clusters of foliage and flowers in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
