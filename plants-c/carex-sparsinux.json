It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spikes of small, usually greenish or brownish flowers. Native to wetland and marshy habitats, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and is often found in temperate regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable environments."
