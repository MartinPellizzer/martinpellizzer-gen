    "intro": "Crataegus myrtifolia, commonly known as the myrtleleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features small, oval leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces clusters of white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem with thorny branches and a preference for well-drained soils in full sun. It is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks, contributing to local biodiversity."
