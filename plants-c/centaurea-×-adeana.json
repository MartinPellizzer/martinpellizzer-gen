    "intro": "Centaurea \u00d7 adeana, commonly known as the hybrid cornflower, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a cross between Centaurea cyanus (blue cornflower) and Centaurea stoebe (devil's bit scabious), resulting in a hybrid with unique floral characteristics. The plant typically features showy, bright blue or purple composite flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in gardens and disturbed habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking vibrant, drought-tolerant plants."
