    "intro": "Claoxylon hillii, commonly known as the hill's claoxylon, is a rare and endangered species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows up to 15 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Claoxylon hillii is critically important for conservation efforts in its native ecosystems."
