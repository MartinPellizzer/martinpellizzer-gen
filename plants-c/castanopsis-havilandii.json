    "intro": "Castanopsis havilandii, commonly known as the Haviland's tanoak, is a species of evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and sturdy, gnarled branches. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are typically encased in a cupule, a feature common among members of its family. Castanopsis havilandii is well adapted to coastal climates, tolerating salt spray and periodic drought conditions. Its ecological role is significant in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals that rely on its acorns as a food source."
