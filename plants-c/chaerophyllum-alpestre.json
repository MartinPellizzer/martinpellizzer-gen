    "intro": "Chaerophyllum alpestre, commonly known as alpine peppergrass, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small white or yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its growth habit is usually low and spreading, with a mat-like appearance that helps it survive in harsh climates. Chaerophyllum alpestre is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
