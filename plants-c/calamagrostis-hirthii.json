    "intro": "Calamagrostis hirthii, commonly known as Hirth's reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to eastern North America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers in late summer to early autumn. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland restoration and landscaping. Calamagrostis hirthii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
