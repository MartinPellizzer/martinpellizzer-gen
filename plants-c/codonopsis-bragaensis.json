    "intro": "Codonopsis bragaensis, commonly known as the Braga's bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Portugal. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
