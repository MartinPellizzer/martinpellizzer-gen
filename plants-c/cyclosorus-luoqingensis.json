    "intro": "Cyclosorus luoqingensis, commonly known as the Luoqing cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant is native to China, specifically the Luoqing region in Yunnan Province, where it thrives in freshwater habitats. Its reproductive structures include tiny, spore-producing organs called sporocarps, which are embedded in the leaf surfaces. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus luoqingensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
