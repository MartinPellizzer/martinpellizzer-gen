    "intro": "Crepis brachypappa, commonly known as the short-stemmed hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces yellow ray flowers surrounded by yellow disk flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Crepis brachypappa is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
