    "intro": "Calanthe undulata, commonly known as the wavy calanthe, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clusters over time. Calanthe undulata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its aesthetic appeal."
