    "intro": "Crepis tomentulosa, commonly known as the woolly hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage and bright yellow composite flowers that resemble a dandelion. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. Its leaves are basal and often have a dense covering of fine hairs, which gives it a woolly appearance. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal uses in traditional herbalism."
