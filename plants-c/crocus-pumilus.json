    "intro": "Crocus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf crocus, is a small perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and delicate, early spring-blooming flowers. The flowers are usually pale yellow or white, with six petals and a distinctive, pointed style. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often appearing among rocks or in woodland edges. This hardy plant is popular in rock gardens and as a winter-flowering addition to garden landscapes."
