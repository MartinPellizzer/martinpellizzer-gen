    "intro": "Carex depressa subsp. transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. It has narrow, cylindrical leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat."
