    "intro": "Caralluma stalagmifera var. intermedia, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent species native to arid regions of India and Pakistan. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that often appear to be suspended in the air, giving it a ghost-like appearance. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers during the rainy season. It is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. This variety is often used in traditional medicine and is also popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance."
