    "intro": "Chamaedaphne calyculata var. nana, commonly known as dwarf swamp waxmyrtle, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically thrives in wetland environments, such as bogs and swamps, where it forms dense, mat-like growth. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and white underneath, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. Its small, fragrant white flowers appear in the fall and are followed by bright red berries that persist through winter. This variety is notable for its compact size and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats."
