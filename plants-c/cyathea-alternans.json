    "intro": "Cyathea alternans, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in attracting pollinators. Cyathea alternans plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
