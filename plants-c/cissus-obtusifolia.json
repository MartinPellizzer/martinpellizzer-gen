    "intro": "Cissus obtusifolia, commonly known as the rock fig or stonecrop, is a climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically consumed raw. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Cissus obtusifolia is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and ability to climb or trail."
