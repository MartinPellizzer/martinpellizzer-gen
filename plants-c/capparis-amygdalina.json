    "intro": "Capparis amygdalina, commonly known as the African sour fig, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are sour in taste. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, and it is often found in woodland and savanna habitats. Capparis amygdalina is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for various health purposes."
