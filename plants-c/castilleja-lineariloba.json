    "intro": "Castilleja lineariloba, commonly known as the slender leaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange-red floral bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant has slender, often hairy stems and small, scale-like leaves. It parasitizes the roots of grasses and other plants, drawing nutrients from its host. Castilleja lineariloba is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and sagebrush steppe."
