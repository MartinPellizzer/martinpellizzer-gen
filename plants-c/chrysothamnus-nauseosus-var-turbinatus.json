    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nauseosus var. turbinatus, commonly known as the Turbinated Greaseweed, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and yellowish-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a pioneer species in disturbed or degraded habitats."
