    "intro": "Carex angarae subsp. pusteriana, commonly known as the Puster Valley sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky or alpine habitats, often found in mountainous areas with cool, temperate climates. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike of small, greenish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
