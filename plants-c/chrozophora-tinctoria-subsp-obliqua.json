    "intro": "Chrozophora tinctoria subsp. obliqua, commonly known as the Mexican spinach or false nettle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated margins and a smooth, hairless surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines for their mild, spinach-like flavor."
