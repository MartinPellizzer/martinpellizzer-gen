    "intro": "Curcuma cordata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed turmeric, is a member of the Zingiberaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces striking, sword-shaped leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in terminal inflorescences. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to other curcuma species. Botanically, it is distinguished by its compact stature and aromatic, tuberous roots."
