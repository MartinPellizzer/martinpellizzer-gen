    "intro": "Cercocoma macrantha, commonly known as the large-seeded desert fig, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fleshy, orange to red fruits that are edible and have a sweet, fig-like taste. Its fruit is an important food source for various wildlife species in its native habitat. Cercocoma macrantha is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
