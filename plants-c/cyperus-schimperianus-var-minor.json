It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats of grass-like foliage. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are often inconspicuous. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in wet or seasonally flooded habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to moist environments, and it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
