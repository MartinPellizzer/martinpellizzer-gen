    "intro": "Cattleya adelinae, commonly known as the Adelina orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is a sympodial orchid with pseudobulbs that support its growth and storage of nutrients. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers, typically in shades of pink, white, and purple, with a prominent lip that distinguishes it from other orchid species. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, arranged in a fan shape, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with high humidity. Cattleya adelinae is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and fragrance."
