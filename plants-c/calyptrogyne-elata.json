    "intro": "Calyptrogyne elata, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or muddy soils near the shoreline. The plant has showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss in salty environments. Calyptrogyne elata is adapted to tolerate salt spray and fluctuating water levels, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems."
