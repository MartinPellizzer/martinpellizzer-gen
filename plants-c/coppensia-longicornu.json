    "intro": "Coppensia longicornu, commonly known as the longhorned orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial shade. Its most distinctive feature is its elongated, slender inflorescence, which bears showy, tubular flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coppensia longicornu is considered a rare and endangered species."
