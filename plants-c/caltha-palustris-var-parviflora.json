    "intro": "Caltha palustris var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf marsh marigold, is a variant of the marsh marigold native to wetland habitats in temperate regions. It is characterized by its small, yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in bogs, fens, and along stream edges. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine, waxy coating. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting early-season pollinators."
