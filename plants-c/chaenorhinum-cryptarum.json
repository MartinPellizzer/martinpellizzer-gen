It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many parts of its native range."
