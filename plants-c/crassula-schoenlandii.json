It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically green with a slight blue or purple tinge. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink during the spring and summer months.

Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
