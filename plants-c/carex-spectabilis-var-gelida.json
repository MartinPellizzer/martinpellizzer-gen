    "intro": "Carex spectabilis var. gelida, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial plant native to cold, mountainous regions. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it thrive in harsh alpine environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically gray-green in color, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss in arid conditions. This variety is well adapted to low temperatures and is often found in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes."
