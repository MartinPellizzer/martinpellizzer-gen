    "intro": "Croton stellatoferrugineus, commonly known as the starry rustleaf croton, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are adorned with a distinctive rust-colored bloom of stellate (star-shaped) structures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its vibrant colors and unique leaf patterns. However, it is important to note that this species can be toxic if ingested, requiring caution in cultivation and handling."
