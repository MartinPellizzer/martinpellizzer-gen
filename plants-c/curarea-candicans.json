It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers and is notable for containing curare, a potent neurotoxin used historically by indigenous peoples. Its botanical significance lies in its role in traditional medicine and as a source of natural toxins for research."
