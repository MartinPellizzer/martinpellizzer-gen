    "intro": "Calvoa orientalis, commonly known as the oriental calvoa, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Lamiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Native to specific regions in eastern Europe, it thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calvoa orientalis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
