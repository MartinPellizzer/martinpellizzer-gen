    "intro": "Carex pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet flowers, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Carex pyramidalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
