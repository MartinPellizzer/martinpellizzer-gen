    "intro": "Caelebogyne ilicifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly-leaf, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, often with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a hardy addition to native gardens. Its unique foliage and ecological value make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
