It features upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
