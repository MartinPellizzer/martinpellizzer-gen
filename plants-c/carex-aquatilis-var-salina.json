    "intro": "Carex aquatilis var. salina, commonly known as salt marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal wetlands. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This variant thrives in saline environments, such as salt marshes and brackish tidal areas, and is adapted to withstand periodic flooding and high salinity. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-ranked spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Carex aquatilis var. salina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
