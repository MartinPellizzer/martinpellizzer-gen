    "intro": "Cestrum costaricense, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that open at night and emit a strong scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains several seeds, and it is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking appearance and unique blooming habit."
