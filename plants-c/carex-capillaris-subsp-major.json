    "intro": "Carex capillaris subsp. major, commonly known as the tall sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization and wetland ecosystem health."
