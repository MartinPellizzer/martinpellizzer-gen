    "intro": "Caladenia carnea var. bartlettii, commonly known as the Bartlett's Spider-orchid, is a striking orchid species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, intricately patterned flower that resembles a spider, hence its common name. The flower typically features a pale pink or cream-colored dorsal sepal and a deep red or purple lip, with intricate veining. This variety thrives in rocky soils and is often found in open forests or heathlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and threatened species."
