    "intro": "Cypripedium guttatum var. wardii, commonly known as the Ward's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or red with contrasting markings. The plant has a long rhizome and produces showy, fragrant blooms that attract specific pollinators. It thrives in cool, moist habitats and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and over-collection."
