    "intro": "Ctenitis exculta, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that display a striking golden hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces clusters of small, spore-bearing sporangia. Ctenitis exculta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
