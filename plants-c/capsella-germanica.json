    "intro": "Capsella germanica, commonly known as mouse-ear or common mouse-ear, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers with five petals and a distinctive five-lobed calyx that persists after flowering. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
