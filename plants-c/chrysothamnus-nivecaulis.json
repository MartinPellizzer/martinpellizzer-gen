    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nivecaulis, commonly known as the white rabbitbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
