    "intro": "Centella tridentata var. tridentata, commonly known as the three-toothed centella, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands and marshes of Southeast Asia. It features a creeping rhizomatous stem with small, heart-shaped leaves that have three distinct lobes. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by dark brown, three-lobed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy areas. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest in both ecological studies and traditional medicine."
