    "intro": "Cardamine curvisiliqua, commonly known as the curly-stemmed watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other members like cabbages and mustard plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small white or yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes and leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it is not as widely cultivated as other members of its family."
