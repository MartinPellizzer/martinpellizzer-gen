    "intro": "Carex lurida var. altior, commonly known as the tall pale sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and is often found in association with other wetland plants. This variety is distinguished from the typical Carex lurida by its taller stature and more robust foliage."
