    "intro": "Cassia nitida, commonly known as golden shower tree or small cassia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched form and its striking clusters of yellow, fragrant flowers that appear in the spring. The leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are glossy and dark green. Cassia nitida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its vibrant floral display. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for tropical and subtropical gardens."
