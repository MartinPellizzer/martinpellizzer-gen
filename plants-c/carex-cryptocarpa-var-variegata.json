    "intro": "Carex cryptocarpa var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with white or yellow variegation, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes during the spring or early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
