    "intro": "Capparis transvaalensis var. calvescens, commonly known as the Transvaal caper, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by spherical, greenish fruits. Its leaves and stems are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy species found in various habitats across its native range."
