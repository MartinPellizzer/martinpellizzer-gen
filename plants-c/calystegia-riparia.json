It is a perennial vine characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to moist environments. Calystegia riparia is often found near water bodies and can thrive in wet meadows and riverbanks."
