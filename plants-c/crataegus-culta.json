    "intro": "Crataegus culta, commonly known as the cultivated hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and showy white or pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are edible but often used as ornamental features. Crataegus culta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and landscapes for its seasonal beauty."
