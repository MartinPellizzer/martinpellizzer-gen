    "intro": "Cereus polygonatus, commonly known as the star cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a ribbed structure with sharp spines, and it is adapted to arid environments. It thrives in full sun and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming make it a popular choice for desert gardens."
