The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to arid environments, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, particularly in mountainous regions. Cousinia karatavica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry conditions."
