It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This variety is distinguished by its numerous flowering stems that arise from the base, creating a dense, upright growth habit. It typically thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and wetlands, and is often found in coastal areas. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in dense inflorescences."
