    "intro": "Carex nivalis, commonly known as the snow sedge, is a perennial plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Carex nivalis is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
