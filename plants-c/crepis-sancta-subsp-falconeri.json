    "intro": "Crepis sancta subsp. falconeri, commonly known as the Falconer's hairy thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and silver-gray, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a compact head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
