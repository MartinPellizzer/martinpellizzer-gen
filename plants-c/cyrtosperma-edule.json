    "intro": "Cyrtosperma edule, commonly known as the edible cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, featuring a stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its seeds are edible and have been traditionally used in local cuisines, though they require careful preparation to avoid toxicity. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appearance and cultural significance in certain regions."
