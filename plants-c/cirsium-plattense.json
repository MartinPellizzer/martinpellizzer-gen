    "intro": "Cirsium plattense, commonly known as the Platt's thistle, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with coarse serrations and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Cirsium plattense is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth and ability to thrive in various conditions."
