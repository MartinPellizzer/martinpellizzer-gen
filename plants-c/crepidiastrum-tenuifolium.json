    "intro": "Crepidiastrum tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaf climbing fern, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It features long, slender, and delicate leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can spread aggressively, making it a common weed in wetland areas. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats."
