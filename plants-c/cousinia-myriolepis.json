    "intro": "Cousinia myriolepis, commonly known as the many-leaved cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silvery-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, which are typical of the daisy family. Cousinia myriolepis is adapted to arid and cold environments, often growing in rocky or alpine soils. Its morphology reflects its evolutionary adaptations to survive in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
