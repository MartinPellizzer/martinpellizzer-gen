It is a flowering plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water conditions, often forming extensive underwater meadows. Its rhizomes help stabilize sediments, contributing to coastal erosion control. Due to its specialized habitat, it plays a vital role in the ecological balance of tidal zones."
