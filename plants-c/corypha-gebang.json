    "intro": "Corypha gebang, commonly known as the giant palm or Borneo palm, is a large, herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its towering, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 6 meters in length. The plant produces distinctive, fleshy, yellowish fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
