    "intro": "Courtenia, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. It consists of several species native to Africa, particularly in regions such as Kenya, Tanzania, and South Africa. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees with simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. They produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Courtenia species are valued for their aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of incense."
