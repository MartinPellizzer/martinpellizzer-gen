    "intro": "Cuscuta chinensis var. carinata, commonly known as Chinese dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to parts of Asia and is often found growing on crops such as rice and soybean. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can be a significant agricultural pest. The species is characterized by its distinctive ridged or keeled stems, which give it its botanical variety name."
