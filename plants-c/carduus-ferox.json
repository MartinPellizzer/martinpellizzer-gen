    "intro": "Carduus ferox, commonly known as the deadly carrot or ferox thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is known for its robust growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including poor and disturbed soils. Its leaves and stems contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans if ingested. Despite its defensive properties, it plays a role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats."
