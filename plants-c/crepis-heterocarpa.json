    "intro": "Crepis heterocarpa, commonly known as the heterocarp silverweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its distinctive feature is the presence of two types of fruits, known as heterocarps, which are adapted for different dispersal methods. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
