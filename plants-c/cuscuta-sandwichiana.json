    "intro": "Cuscuta sandwichiana, commonly known as the sand island dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to the Hawaiian Islands and is often found growing on native shrubs and trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and can remain dormant for long periods in the soil. Due to its specialized parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
