It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and showy cyathium inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Canthium pedunculare is often found in moist, disturbed habitats and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
