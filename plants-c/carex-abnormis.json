It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. This plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, often nutrient-rich soils. Its grass-like leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters. Carex abnormis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
