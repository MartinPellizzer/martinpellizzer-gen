    "intro": "Colchicum praeirroratum, commonly known as the silver-leaf colchicum, is a member of the Colchicaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a perennial herb characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a bulbous corm, which serves as its primary storage organ and allows it to survive in harsh environments. Its foliage consists of broad, leathery leaves that are often covered in a silvery coating, giving it its common name. It blooms in late spring to early summer, making it a notable addition to alpine and woodland gardens."
