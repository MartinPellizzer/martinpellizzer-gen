    "intro": "Chamaecytisus colchicus, commonly known as the creeping rosebay rhododendron, is a shrub native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
