    "intro": "Cynosurus echinatus var. thracicus, commonly known as the Thrace bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
