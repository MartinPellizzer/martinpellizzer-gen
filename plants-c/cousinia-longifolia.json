    "intro": "Cousinia longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Cousinia longifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
