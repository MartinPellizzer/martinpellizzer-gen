    "intro": "Carpinus laxiflora var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive pendulous branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a graceful appearance. The tree has small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring. Its fruit is a small, winged samara that aids in wind dispersal. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks."
