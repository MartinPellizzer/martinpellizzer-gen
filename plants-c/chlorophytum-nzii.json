    "intro": "Chlorophytum nzii, commonly known as the New Zealand spider plant, is a member of the Asparagaceae family. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its long, arching leaves that resemble spider legs, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It is a hardy, evergreen perennial that thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun. Chlorophytum nzii is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and air-purifying qualities."
