    "intro": "Crataegus communis, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and northwestern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 3\u201310 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries that are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally not consumed by humans. Crataegus communis is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing soil."
