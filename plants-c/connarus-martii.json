    "intro": "Connarus martii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a slow-growing, deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark brown bark and small, leathery leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. Its wood is extremely hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and furniture. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
