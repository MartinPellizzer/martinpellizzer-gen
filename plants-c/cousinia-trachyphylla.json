    "intro": "Cousinia trachyphylla, commonly known as the roughleaf cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Cousinia trachyphylla is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing fragile ecosystems."
