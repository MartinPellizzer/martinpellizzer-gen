It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive, large, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing desert soils. Its ecological importance includes providing food and habitat for various desert animals."
