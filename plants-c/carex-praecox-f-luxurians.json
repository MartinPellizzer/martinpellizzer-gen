    "intro": "Carex praecox f. luxurians, commonly known as the early sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, often wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that contain both male and female flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it a common component of wetland vegetation. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
