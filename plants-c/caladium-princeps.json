    "intro": "Caladium princeps, commonly known as the pink princess caladium, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that display vibrant shades of pink, red, and white. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Caladium princeps is typically grown as an annual in cooler regions but can be perennial in USDA hardiness zones 9 through 11."
