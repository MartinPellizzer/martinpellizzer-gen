    "intro": "Cyperus scaberrimus, commonly known as the rough flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces distinctive, three-angled seed clusters. Cyperus scaberrimus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
