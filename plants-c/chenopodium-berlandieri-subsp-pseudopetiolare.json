It is native to the central and eastern United States, where it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a rough, prickly texture along the margins. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, rounded berries that contain seeds. It is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a food source."
