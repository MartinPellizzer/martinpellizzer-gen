    "intro": "Ctenitis fenestralis, commonly known as the fenestrated tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft blue light at night, which is a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, shaded environments. The plant thrives in tropical rainforests and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dense undergrowth."
