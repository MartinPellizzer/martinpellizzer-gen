    "intro": "Callitriche palustris subsp. pedunculata, commonly known as the aquatic starwort, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant features small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, and it has thin, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface. It is often found in still or slow-moving waters and can form dense mats on the water\u2019s surface. This subspecies is characterized by its elongated peduncles, which support its flowering stems above the water."
