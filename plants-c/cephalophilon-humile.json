    "intro": "Cephalophilon humile, commonly known as the dwarf helmet orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped flower that is typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant has a short, hairy stem and produces a single, compact flower cluster. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
