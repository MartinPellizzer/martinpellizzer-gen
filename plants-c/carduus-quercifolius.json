    "intro": "Carduus quercifolius, commonly known as the oak-leaved thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of an oak tree, giving it its common name. The plant produces spiny, purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Carduus quercifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
