    "intro": "Cyclosorus stenodontus, commonly known as the narrow-toothed water clover, is a species of aquatic fern native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant typically grows in slow-moving streams and ponds, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, sunny conditions. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Cyclosorus stenodontus is valued in both ecological restoration projects and as an ornamental plant in water gardens."
