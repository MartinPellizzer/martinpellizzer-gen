    "intro": "Centaurea deusta var. heterochlamyda, commonly known as the Alaskan sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Alaska and northwest Canada. It is a perennial herb characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and silver-blue foliage. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to harsh maritime conditions. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, with the former being longer and more showy. The variety heterochlamyda is distinguished by its unique floral structure, where the outer florets are shorter and more tightly packed compared to the typical form."
