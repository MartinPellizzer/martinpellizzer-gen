    "intro": "Chondrilla fontinalis, commonly known as the spring beauty, is a small flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has delicate, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, which includes other plants like buckwheat and sorrel. Due to its short blooming period and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
