    "intro": "Ctenitis refulgens, commonly known as the glittering holly fern, is a striking member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its elegant, finely divided fronds that emit a shimmering appearance due to the presence of calcareous spore cases. Its spores are released in autumn, contributing to its reproductive cycle in the forest understory. Ctenitis refulgens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
