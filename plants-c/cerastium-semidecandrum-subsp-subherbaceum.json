    "intro": "Cerastium semidecandrum subsp. subherbaceum, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, herbaceous leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse seeds by wind."
