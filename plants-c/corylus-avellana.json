    "intro": "Corylus avellana, commonly known as the hazelnut or horned hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It produces oval, edible nuts enclosed in a spiky husk, which ripen in the autumn. The plant has alternate, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges. Its flowers are unisexual, with male catkins appearing before the female flowers. Corylus avellana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping due to its attractive form and autumn color."
