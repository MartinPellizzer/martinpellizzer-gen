    "intro": "Camaridium boliviense, commonly known as the Bolivian starflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Bolivia. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its striking star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky soils and open slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Camaridium boliviense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
