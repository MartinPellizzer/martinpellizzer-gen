    "intro": "Cotoneaster integerrimus subsp. masclansii, commonly known as the Chilean cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to South America, particularly Chile. It features small, glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy ornamental plant in temperate climates. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
