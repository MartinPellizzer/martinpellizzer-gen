    "intro": "Canavalia microsperma, commonly known as the small-seeded cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and erect, branching stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to pods containing small, round seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for cultivation in arid environments. Canavalia microsperma is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
