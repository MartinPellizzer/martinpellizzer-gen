    "intro": "Carex luzulina var. luzulina, commonly known as blue sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in swampy areas, along stream banks, or in shaded woodlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually a striking blue-green color, which gives it its common name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Blue sedge is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
