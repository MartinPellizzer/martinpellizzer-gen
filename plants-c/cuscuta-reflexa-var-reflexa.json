    "intro": "Cuscuta reflexa var. reflexa, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and often grows on crops such as corn and beans. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, making it a common weed in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the yield of its host plants."
