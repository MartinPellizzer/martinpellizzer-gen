    "intro": "Clematis cadmia, commonly known as the pink clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically pink or white, appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to climb trellises or fences. Clematis cadmia is relatively low maintenance but benefits from regular pruning to maintain its shape and promote flowering."
