It features bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, thorned stems and small, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a hedge plant. The hybrid is a cross between Cytisus scoparius and Cytisus rubens, resulting in a unique combination of characteristics from both parent species."
