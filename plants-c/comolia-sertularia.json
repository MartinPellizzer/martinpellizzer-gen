    "intro": "Comolia sertularia, commonly known as the sea fan, is a colonial marine organism belonging to the order Gorgonida. It is characterized by its branching, calcareous skeleton that supports its polyps, which are covered in nematocysts for capturing prey. The plant thrives in shallow, warm waters and is often found in coral reef environments. Its coloration can vary, typically displaying shades of yellow, orange, or red, depending on the symbiotic algae it hosts. Comolia sertularia plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for various small marine organisms."
