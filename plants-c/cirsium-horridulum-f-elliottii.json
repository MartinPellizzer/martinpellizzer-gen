    "intro": "Cirsium horridulum f. elliottii, commonly known as Elliott's thistle, is a variant of the common thistle found in the eastern United States. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its spiny, prickly leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. Its foliage is covered with fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The species is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinators."
