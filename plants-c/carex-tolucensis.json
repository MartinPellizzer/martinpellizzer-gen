    "intro": "Carex tolucensis, commonly known as the Tolucan sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers, which are usually wind-pollinated. Carex tolucensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystem."
