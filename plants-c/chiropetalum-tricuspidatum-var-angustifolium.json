    "intro": "Chiropetalum tricuspidatum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved three-lobed bellflower, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces striking bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
