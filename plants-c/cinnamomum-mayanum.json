    "intro": "Cinnamomum mayanum, commonly known as Mayan cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and reddish-brown bark, which are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark blue berries containing elliptical seeds. Its essential oils, extracted from the leaves and bark, contain compounds like cinnamaldehyde and eugenol. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Cinnamomum mayanum is considered vulnerable in its native range."
