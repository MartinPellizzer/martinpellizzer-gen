    "intro": "Calypso bulbosa var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers with a unique, ghost-like appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the canopy of forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
