    "intro": "Comanthera jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its pale green to white flowers, which resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, leafless stem that supports a single or few flowers. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or in rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Comanthera jenmanii is considered endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws."
