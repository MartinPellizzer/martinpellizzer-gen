    "intro": "Coleostachys vestita, commonly known as the velvetleaf cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense clusters of cylindrical, ribbed stems covered in a soft, velvety coating. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. The velvetleaf cholla plays a role in desert ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
