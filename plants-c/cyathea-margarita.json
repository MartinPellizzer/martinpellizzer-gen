    "intro": "Cyathea margarita, commonly known as the margarita tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern, with its fronds emerging from the top of the trunk in a spiral arrangement. Cyathea margarita thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its rhizome system supports the plant's growth and helps it anchor in moist, nutrient-rich soil."
