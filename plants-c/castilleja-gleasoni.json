    "intro": "Castilleja gleasoni, commonly known as Gleason's Indian paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in its native ecosystem."
