It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which is a distinctive botanical feature. Cacalia ternata is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it contributes to the local biodiversity."
