    "intro": "Caccinia rauwolfii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, succulent stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Caccinia rauwolfii is also known for its latex-like sap, which has been used traditionally for various purposes."
