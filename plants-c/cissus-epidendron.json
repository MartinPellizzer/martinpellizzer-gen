    "intro": "Cissus epidendron, commonly known as the climbing cissus, is a tropical vine native to regions of Africa and southern Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by berries that mature to a bright red color. Cissus epidendron thrives in warm, humid environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage. It is also valued for its ability to climb and trail along structures, making it a popular choice for vertical gardens and hanging baskets."
