    "intro": "Campanula dehiscens, commonly known as the spreading bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of narrow, silver-green leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Campanula dehiscens is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
