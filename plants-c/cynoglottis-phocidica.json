    "intro": "Cynoglottis phocidica, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in saline or sandy soils and thrives in coastal environments with high exposure to wind and salt spray. Its leaves are usually fleshy and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers bloom in late summer, producing a striking blue or purple color that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
