    "intro": "Campanula cymbalaria var. papillosa, commonly known as the hairy bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered with fine, hairy glands, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
