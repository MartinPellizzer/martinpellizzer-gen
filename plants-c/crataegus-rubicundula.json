    "intro": "Crataegus rubicundula, commonly known as the red-fruited hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and showy pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Botanically, it belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to other hawthorn species. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth."
