    "intro": "Conyza artemisiifolia, commonly known as goatweed, is an annual flowering plant native to Africa, but now widely distributed across temperate regions worldwide. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces numerous tiny seeds that are easily dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive nature in many ecosystems. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
