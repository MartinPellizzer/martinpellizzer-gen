    "intro": "Crataegus colorado, commonly known as the Colorado hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pinkish flowers in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often tart, and they serve as a food source for birds and wildlife. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Crataegus colorado is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness in colder climates."
