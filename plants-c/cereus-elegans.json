    "intro": "Cereus elegans, commonly known as the elegant candle cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its tall, spiny stems and clusters of white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a slow growth rate and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its nocturnal blooming habit is an adaptation to attract specific pollinators active during the evening hours."
