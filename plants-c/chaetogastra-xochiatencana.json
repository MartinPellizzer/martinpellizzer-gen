    "intro": "Chaetogastra xochiatencana, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are pollinated by specific species of bees, contributing to its ecological uniqueness. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild."
