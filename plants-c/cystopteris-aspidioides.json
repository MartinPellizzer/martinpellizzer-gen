    "intro": "Cystopteris aspidioides, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into smaller, lanceolate segments. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across temperate regions. Its delicate, intricate foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
