    "intro": "Canarium glaucum, commonly known as the white-berried candlenut, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The tree produces hard, waxy fruits containing a single, white, oily seed, which is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil. Canarium glaucum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
