    "intro": "Cyperus leptophyllus var. ibeensis, commonly known as the Ibea flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often submerged or floating. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
