    "intro": "Chaetogastra laxa, commonly known as the hairy panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stem. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
