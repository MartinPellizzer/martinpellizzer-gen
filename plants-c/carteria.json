    "intro": "Carteria, commonly known as the African daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. Carteria species typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. They are often grown in gardens for their ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Some species are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
