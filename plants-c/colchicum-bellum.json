    "intro": "Colchicum bellum, commonly known as the bellflower colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, violet, and purple, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. Its bulbs are toxic and contain colchicine, a compound used in medicine. Colchicum bellum thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded habitats."
