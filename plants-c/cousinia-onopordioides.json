    "intro": "Cousinia onopordioides, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Cousinia onopordioides is well adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
