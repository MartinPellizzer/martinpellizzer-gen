    "intro": "Ctenitis aciculata, commonly known as the needle fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, needle-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the forest floor. Ctenitis aciculata plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
