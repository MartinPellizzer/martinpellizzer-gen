    "intro": "Collinsia grandiflora var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf fairy bells, is a low-growing annual plant native to the western United States. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a subtle purple or red tinge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy clusters of blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower displays. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
