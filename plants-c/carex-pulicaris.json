    "intro": "Carex pulicaris, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and heathlands. Carex pulicaris plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
