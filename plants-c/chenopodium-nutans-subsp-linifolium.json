    "intro": "Chenopodium nutans subsp. linifolium, commonly known as the nodding goosefoot, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are encased in a papery, triangular bract. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along creek banks. The subspecies linifolium is distinguished by its linear leaves and shorter, more compact growth habit compared to other subspecies."
