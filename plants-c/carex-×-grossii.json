    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 grossii, commonly known as the hybrid sedges, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex appressa and Carex brevifolia, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant forms dense clumps of grass-like foliage with cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in suitable habitats."
