    "intro": "Clypeola jonthlaspi proles hispida, commonly known as the hairy shield-leaf cress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, shield-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typical of the family. It thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. The species is notable for its hirsute (hairy) foliage, which provides protection against herbivory and desiccation."
