    "intro": "Cheilanthes corsica, commonly known as the Corsican rock fern, is a species of fern native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in rocky, dry environments, often growing on limestone or sandstone substrates. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form with dense, leathery fronds that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the Polypodiaceae family. Cheilanthes corsica is well adapted to Mediterranean climates and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
