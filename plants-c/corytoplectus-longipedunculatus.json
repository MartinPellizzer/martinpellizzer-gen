    "intro": "Corytoplectus longipedunculatus, commonly known as the long-stemmed sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the western Atlantic. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has woody stems that are often covered in a thick, fibrous layer, providing structural support. Its leaves are alternate and elliptical, with a rough texture that helps in reducing water loss. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often found in brackish or saltwater environments."
