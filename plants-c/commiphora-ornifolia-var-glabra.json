It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish in color. The plant produces a resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and incense. Its growth habit is shrub-like, with a dense canopy and a preference for tropical or subtropical climates. The botanical features of this plant make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and pharmacological study."
