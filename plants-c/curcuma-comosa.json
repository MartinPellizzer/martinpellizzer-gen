    "intro": "Curcuma comosa, commonly known as the fragrant turmeric or golden turmeric, is a rhizomatous herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, yellow-orange rhizomes that are rich in curcumin. The plant features narrow, sword-shaped leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in inflorescences. Its rhizomes are widely used in traditional medicine and as a culinary spice due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Curcuma comosa thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil."
