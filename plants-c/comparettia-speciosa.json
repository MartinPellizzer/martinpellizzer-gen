    "intro": "Comparettia speciosa, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy flowers with vibrant colors, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The flowers bloom in clusters, making it a striking addition to botanical gardens and greenhouses."
