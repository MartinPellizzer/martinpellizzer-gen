    "intro": "Cortiella cauwetmarciana, commonly known as the golden cup fungus, is a species of corticioid fungus in the family Corticiaceae. It is characterized by its small, resupinate, and often yellowish to orange-colored fruiting bodies that grow on decaying wood. The hymenium is smooth and lacks a distinct layer of sterile cells. It is typically found in temperate regions, growing on fallen logs and stumps of various hardwood trees. Due to its specific habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commonly encountered species in mycological studies."
