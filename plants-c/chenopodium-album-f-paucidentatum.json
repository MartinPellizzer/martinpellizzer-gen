    "intro": "Chenopodium album f. paucidentatum, commonly known as lamb's-quarters, is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as gardens, fields, and along roadsides. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture and small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its seeds are minute and dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. This variety is characterized by its reduced leaf teeth compared to the typical form of Chenopodium album."
