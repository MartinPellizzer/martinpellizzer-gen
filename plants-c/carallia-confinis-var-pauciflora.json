    "intro": "Carallia confinis var. pauciflora, commonly known as the rare coastal shrub, is a low-growing plant native to specific coastal regions. It features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
