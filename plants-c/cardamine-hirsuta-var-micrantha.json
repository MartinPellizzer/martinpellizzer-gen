    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta var. micrantha, commonly known as the hairy watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features alternate, trifoliate leaves with a hairy surface, which gives it its common name. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are borne in clusters and are pollinated by insects. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
