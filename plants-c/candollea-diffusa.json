    "intro": "Candollea diffusa, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has rounded, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Candollea diffusa is often considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range."
