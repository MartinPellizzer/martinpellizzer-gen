    "intro": "Carex carniolica, commonly known as the Carniolan sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. Carex carniolica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
