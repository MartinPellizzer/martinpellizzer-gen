    "intro": "Corydalis hendersonii, commonly known as the Henderson's corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds enclosed in a capsule, which is a common reproductive strategy among members of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
