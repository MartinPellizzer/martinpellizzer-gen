    "intro": "Crataegus ampla, commonly known as the American hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 3\u201310 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pinkish flowers in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that ripen in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks. Crataegus ampla is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
