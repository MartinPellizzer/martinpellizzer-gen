    "intro": "Catasetum serratum, commonly known as the serrated catasetum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces specialized structures called \"capes\" on its pollinia, which are unique to the orchid family and aid in pollination. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Catasetum serratum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
