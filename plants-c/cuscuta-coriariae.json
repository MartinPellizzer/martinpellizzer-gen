    "intro": "Cuscuta coriariae, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of slender, thread-like stems. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize a wide range of host species. It is often found on agricultural crops and wild plants, causing damage by draining resources from its hosts. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth and survival of its host plants."
