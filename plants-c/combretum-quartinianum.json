    "intro": "Combretum quartinianum, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its striking red flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the dry season. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape and have a smooth upper surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and woodland areas. The bark is thick and often flaky, providing some resistance to browsing by animals."
