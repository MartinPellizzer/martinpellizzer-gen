    "intro": "Celsia scrophulariifolia var. ellenbeckii, commonly known as Ellenbeck's celsia, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in the spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions. Due to its unique appearance and restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Scrophulariaceae family."
