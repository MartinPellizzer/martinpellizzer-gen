    "intro": "Chrysosplenium pilosum var. pilosopetiolatum, commonly known as the hairy-leaved chrysosplenium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to moist, shaded forest floors in eastern North America. It features small, ovate leaves that are densely covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The flowers are typically white or pale green, clustered in umbels, and bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, humid conditions and is often found in rich, loamy soil. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique and attractive addition to woodland gardens."
