    "intro": "Conocephalus subtrinervius, commonly known as the three-veined fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid environments. The plant has delicate, pinnate fronds with three distinct veins, giving it its scientific name. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in shaded, moist conditions."
