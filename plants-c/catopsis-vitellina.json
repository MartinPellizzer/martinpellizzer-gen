    "intro": "Catopsis vitellina, commonly known as the yellow moss or golden moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with small, bright yellow-green leaves that are tightly clustered. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its structure consists of a thallus with distinct leaf-like structures. Catopsis vitellina is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in controlled, humid conditions."
