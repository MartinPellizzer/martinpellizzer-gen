    "intro": "Clethra uleana, commonly known as the fragrant sweet pepperbush, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. Clethra uleana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
