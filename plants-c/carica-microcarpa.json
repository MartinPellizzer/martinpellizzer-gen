    "intro": "Carica microcarpa, commonly known as the little pawpaw, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Caricaceae family, which includes other pawpaw species. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. Its fruit, though not as large as the common pawpaw, is edible and has a mild, sweet flavor. The tree is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance and resilience in tropical climates."
