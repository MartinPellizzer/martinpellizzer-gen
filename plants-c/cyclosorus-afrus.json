    "intro": "Cyclosorus afrus, commonly known as the African cyclosorus, is a small, aquatic fern native to southern Africa. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as streams and ponds. The plant has finely divided, thread-like fronds that are often submerged, contributing to its delicate appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Cyclosorus afrus plays a minor but important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality maintenance."
