    "intro": "Carpenteria, commonly known as the California fuchsia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive red-orange tubular flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for arid climates. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Carpenteria produces small, fuzzy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across its native range."
