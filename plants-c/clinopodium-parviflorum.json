    "intro": "Clinopodium parviflorum, commonly known as small-flowered wood betony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, pale blue or violet flowers clustered in whorls. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, and it is often found in association with other woodland flora. Clinopodium parviflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
