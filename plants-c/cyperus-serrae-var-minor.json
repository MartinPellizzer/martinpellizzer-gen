    "intro": "Cyperus serrae var. minor, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its small, three-lobed flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils. Cyperus serrae var. minor is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed aquatic habitats."
