    "intro": "Combretum hildebrandtii, commonly known as the red-flowered combretum, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
