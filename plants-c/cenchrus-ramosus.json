    "intro": "Cenchrus ramosus, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and the presence of dense, hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered in panicles, with lemmas that are often hairy or bristly. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its adaptability, it is both a useful forage plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
