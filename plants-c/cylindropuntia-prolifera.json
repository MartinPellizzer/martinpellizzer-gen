    "intro": "Cylindropuntia prolifera, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a flowering plant in the cactus family, Cactaceae, and is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant is also known for its ability to propagate through both seeds and offsets, contributing to its widespread distribution."
