    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis var. laurentiana, commonly known as the Laurentian brittle bladder fern, is a delicate fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are often covered in a thin, waxy layer. The plant produces small, round spore cases called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fragile, papery fronds give it the common name \"brittle bladder fern,\" reflecting its delicate structure and appearance."
