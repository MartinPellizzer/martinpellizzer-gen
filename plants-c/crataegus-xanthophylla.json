    "intro": "Crataegus xanthophylla, commonly known as the yellowleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its yellowish-green leaves, which give it its common name, and its showy white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Crataegus xanthophylla is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
