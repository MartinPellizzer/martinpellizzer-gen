    "intro": "Corchorus congener, commonly known as the common knotgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides and riverbanks. The plant features palmate leaves with lobed margins and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its seeds are encased in a fibrous, hairy capsule that aids in wind dispersal. Corchorus congener is noted for its adaptability and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
