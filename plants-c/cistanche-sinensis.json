    "intro": "Cistanche sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese\u82c1\u84c9, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It grows primarily on the roots of specific host plants, such as the wild licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis). The plant is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, which necessitates its parasitic lifestyle for survival. Its medicinal value in traditional Chinese medicine is well recognized, particularly for its purported benefits in enhancing vitality and sexual function. Cistanche sinensis is native to arid and semi-arid regions of China, Mongolia, and parts of Central Asia."
