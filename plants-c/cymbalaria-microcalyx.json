    "intro": "Cymbalaria microcalyx, commonly known as the small-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural fields. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host plants."
