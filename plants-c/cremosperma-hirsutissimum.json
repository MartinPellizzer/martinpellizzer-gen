    "intro": "Cremosperma hirsutissimum, commonly known as the hairy creamroot, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a taproot system and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The hairy creamroot is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a common sight in dry, open habitats."
