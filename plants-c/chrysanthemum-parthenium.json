It is characterized by its daisy-like flowers, which range in color from white to yellow and sometimes pink. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 100 centimeters and has finely divided, fern-like leaves. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and medicinal use. The leaves and flowers contain compounds such as parthenin, which have been used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties."
