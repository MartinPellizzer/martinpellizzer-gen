    "intro": "Campanula buseri, commonly known as the Buser's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lanceolate, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Campanula buseri thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
