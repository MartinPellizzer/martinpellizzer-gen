    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum polliculosum, commonly known as the woolly petal orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, hairy leaves and showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has a long flowering period, making it a notable species in botanical studies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
