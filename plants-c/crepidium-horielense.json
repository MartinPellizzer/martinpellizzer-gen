    "intro": "Crepidium horielense, commonly known as the Horiel's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, creeping rhizome. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
