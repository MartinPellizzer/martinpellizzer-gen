    "intro": "Cynanchum racemosum var. unifarium, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by follicles containing toxic, milky sap. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
