    "intro": "Cariniana, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and produces distinctive orange, spiky fruits that contain the edible seeds known as Brazil nuts. The plant belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is valued for its ecological and economic importance. Cariniana trees can grow up to 30 meters tall and have a long lifespan, often living over 100 years. Their flowers are small and white, often clustered in dense inflorescences, and they rely on specific pollinators for reproduction."
