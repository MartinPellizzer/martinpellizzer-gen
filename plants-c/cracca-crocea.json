    "intro": "Cracca crocea, commonly known as the red brome, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear bright red or orange flowers, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Cracca crocea thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and rocky areas. It is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
