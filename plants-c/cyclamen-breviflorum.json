    "intro": "Cyclamen breviflorum, commonly known as the short-flowered cyclamen, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and produces clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10\u201315 cm and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its tuberous roots allow it to survive periods of dormancy, making it suitable for cultivation in shaded, well-drained soil. Cyclamen breviflorum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often grown as a houseplant or in rock gardens."
