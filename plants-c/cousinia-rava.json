    "intro": "Cousinia rava, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with silver-blue foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in composite heads, typically blooming in spring. Cousinia rava is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
