    "intro": "Calamagrostis epigejos f. flavescens, commonly known as the golden bluestem grass, is a variant of the common bluestem grass native to North America. It is a perennial grass characterized by its clumping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tall, slender inflorescences that are typically golden or bronze in color, giving it its common name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for native gardens and restoration projects. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking fall color and ability to form dense, attractive clumps."
