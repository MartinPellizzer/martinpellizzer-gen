    "intro": "Cousinia eburnea, commonly known as the silver flax or white flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that allow it to colonize new areas effectively. Cousinia eburnea is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
