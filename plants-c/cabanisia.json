    "intro": "Cabanisia, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species native to the Americas, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. The plants are characterized by their yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in composite heads, and their basal rosettes of leaves. Cabanisia species are often found in rocky soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions. They are also valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
