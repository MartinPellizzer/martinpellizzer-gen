    "intro": "Crotalaria oligostachya, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed cowpea or the narrow-stemmed crotalaria, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and alternate, pinnate leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces clusters of yellow, pea-like flowers, which are typically followed by elongated, bean-shaped pods containing several seeds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural systems to improve soil fertility."
