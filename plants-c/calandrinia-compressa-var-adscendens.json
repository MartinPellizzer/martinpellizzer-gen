    "intro": "Calandrinia compressa var. adscendens, commonly known as the ascending purslane, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it drought-tolerant. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils in arid environments."
