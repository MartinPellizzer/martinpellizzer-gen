    "intro": "Causonis medoensis, commonly known as the Medean Causon, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Capparaceae. It is characterized by its small, herbaceous structure with simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in specific, often arid or semi-arid habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
