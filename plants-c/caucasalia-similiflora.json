    "intro": "Caucasalia similiflora, commonly known as the Caucasian similar-flower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas and prefers well-drained soils. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
