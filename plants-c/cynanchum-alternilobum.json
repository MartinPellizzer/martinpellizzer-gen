    "intro": "Cynanchum alternilobum, commonly known as the variable milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant features opposite, alternate, and sometimes whorled leaves that are usually heart-shaped or ovate. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in umbels, while its fruits are follicles containing toxic seeds. Due to its milky sap and toxic properties, it is often avoided by herbivores and requires caution when handling."
