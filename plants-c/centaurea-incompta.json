    "intro": "Centaurea incompta, commonly known as the narrowleaf star-thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, bract-covered flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its bright purple or blue flowers bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Centaurea incompta is considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range."
