    "intro": "Cephalomanes setigerum, commonly known as the hairy sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian belonging to the family Actinidae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated body covered in fine, branched tentacles that are used for capturing prey. The organism has a central oral disc surrounded by a ring of tentacles, and its coloration can vary from pale pink to reddish-brown. It typically inhabits shallow coastal waters and is often found attached to rocks or other substrates. Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered an indicator species for marine ecosystem health."
