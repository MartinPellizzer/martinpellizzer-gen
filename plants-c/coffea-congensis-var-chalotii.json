    "intro": "Coffea congensis var. chalotii, commonly known as the Chalot's coffee, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the Coffea genus native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped berries that contain two seeds, which are used to produce its unique coffee beans. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the understory of tropical rainforests. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, with a slightly serrated edge, and it produces white flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and low cultivation, Chalot's coffee is considered a specialty and highly sought-after bean in the global coffee market."
