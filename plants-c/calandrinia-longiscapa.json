    "intro": "Calandrinia longiscapa, commonly known as the long-stemmed sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Calandrinia longiscapa is adapted to drought conditions, with succulent leaves that help store water. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats."
