    "intro": "Chondrosea petrophila, commonly known as the rock tamarisk, is a halophytic shrub native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, and it produces pink to purple flowers in summer. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native wildlife. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an important species for ecological restoration in coastal environments."
