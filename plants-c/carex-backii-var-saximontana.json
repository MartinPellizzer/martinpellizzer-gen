    "intro": "Carex backii var. saximontana, commonly known as the saximontana sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that form compact clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
