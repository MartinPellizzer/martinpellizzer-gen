    "intro": "Cakile maritima subsp. islandica, commonly known as the island sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the North Atlantic. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by triangular, pod-like fruits that disperse seeds by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along rocky shores. This subspecies is adapted to harsh maritime conditions, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
