    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum retusiusculum, commonly known as the hairy leaved bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in its high-altitude habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific growing conditions to flourish."
