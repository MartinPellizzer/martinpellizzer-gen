    "intro": "Cynanchum birostratum, commonly known as the two-beaked milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of East Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by follicles that contain toxic, milky sap. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
