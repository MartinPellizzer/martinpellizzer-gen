    "intro": "Coryphopteris ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann\u2019s holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are often adorned with a pale, waxy coating. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
