    "intro": "Cirsium alpicola, commonly known as the alpine thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in a composite head. Cirsium alpicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators in its native habitat."
