    "intro": "Centaurea aucheri subsp. aucheri, commonly known as the Armenian crownflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It features striking, bright blue to purple ray flowers surrounded by a dense, spiky central disk, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
