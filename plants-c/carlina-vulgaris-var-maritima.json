    "intro": "Carlina vulgaris var. maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads surrounded by sharp, spiny bracts. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt-laden winds and harsh maritime conditions. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-gray, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. It is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
