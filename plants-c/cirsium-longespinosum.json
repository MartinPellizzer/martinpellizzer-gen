    "intro": "Cirsium longespinosum, commonly known as the long-spined thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant has deeply lobed, silver-green leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and rocky areas. Cirsium longespinosum is known for its defensive spines, which deter herbivores and aid in seed dispersal."
