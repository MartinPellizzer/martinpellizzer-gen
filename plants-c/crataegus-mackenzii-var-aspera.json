    "intro": "Crataegus mackenzii var. aspera, commonly known as the rough-fruited hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and small, oval leaves. The plant produces white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its fruit is edible but has a tart flavor, and the plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The rough texture of its fruit and leaves gives it its scientific name, \"aspera,\" meaning rough in Latin."
