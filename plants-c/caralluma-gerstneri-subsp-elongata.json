    "intro": "Caralluma gerstneri subsp. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed horned cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments by storing water in its fleshy stems. Its structure and appearance make it a distinctive and resilient member of the Cactaceae family."
