    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 naegelii, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedgewort, is a hybrid plant in the Carex genus, native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like foliage and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. The flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant produces small, dry fruits known as achenes."
