    "intro": "Cynoglossum sessilifolium, commonly known as black horehound, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. The plant produces purple to blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The plant has a long history of use in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
