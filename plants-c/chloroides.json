These plants are characterized by their bright yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in dense, spherical clusters called capitula. Chloroides species are native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America, Europe, and Asia. They are often found in meadows, roadsides, and other disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. The genus includes several species, such as *Solidago* and *Hieracium*, which are widely recognized for their ornamental value and ecological importance."
