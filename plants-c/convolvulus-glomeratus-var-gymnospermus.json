    "intro": "Convolvulus glomeratus var. gymnospermus, commonly known as the gymnospermous bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, trailing stems that produce small, pale yellow flowers with five petals. The leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. This variant is distinguished by its unique seed structure, which resembles that of gymnosperms, though it is still classified as an angiosperm."
