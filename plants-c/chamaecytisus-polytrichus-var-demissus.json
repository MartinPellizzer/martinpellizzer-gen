    "intro": "Chamaecytisus polytrichus var. demissus, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, woody stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
