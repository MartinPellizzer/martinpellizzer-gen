    "intro": "Campanula persicifolia moerheimii, commonly known as the Persian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
