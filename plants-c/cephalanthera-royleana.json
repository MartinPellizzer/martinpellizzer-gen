    "intro": "Cephalanthera royleana, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-purple flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments and has a short rhizome with fleshy roots. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, prominent flower per stem. Cephalanthera royleana is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its complex ecological relationships."
