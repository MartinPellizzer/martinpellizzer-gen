    "intro": "Castilleja flavescens, commonly known as the yellow owl's clover, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks, where it attaches to the roots of other plants to obtain some of its nutrients. Its unique ecological role as a parasitic plant contributes to the diversity of plant communities in its habitat."
