    "intro": "Chaetostoma aureum, commonly known as the golden pleco, is a species of freshwater catfish native to South America. It is characterized by its elongated body and distinctive golden coloration, which becomes more pronounced in adult specimens. The plant's botanical features include a single, fleshy root that anchors it to substrates in slow-moving waters. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. The plant thrives in warm, well-lit environments with moderate water flow."
