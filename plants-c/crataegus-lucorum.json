It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval leaves, and clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits called haws, which are edible but often used in jams and wines. Crataegus lucorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting wildlife, including birds and insects. It is also known for its medicinal properties, with its flowers used in traditional remedies for heart conditions."
