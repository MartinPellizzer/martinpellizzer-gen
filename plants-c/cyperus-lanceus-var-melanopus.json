    "intro": "Cyperus lanceus var. melanopus, commonly known as black rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along waterways, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has slender, dark green stems that often turn black at maturity, giving it its common name. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Cyperus lanceus var. melanopus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
