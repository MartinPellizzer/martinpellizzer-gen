    "intro": "Cycas hongheensis, commonly known as the Honghe cycad, is a rare and ancient cycad species native to China. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant is typically found in subtropical regions with well-drained soil and mild climates. Its cones, which are either male or female, are essential for its reproduction. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
