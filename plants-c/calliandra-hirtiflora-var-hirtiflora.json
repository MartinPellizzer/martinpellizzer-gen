    "intro": "Calliandra hirtiflora var. hirtiflora, commonly known as the hairy pod calliandra, is a shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, showy inflorescences that consist of numerous small, pink to red flowers. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen, it is also used in ecological restoration projects."
