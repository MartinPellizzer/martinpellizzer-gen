    "intro": "Chrysopsis subulata, commonly known as the silverleaf goldeneye, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It features narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
