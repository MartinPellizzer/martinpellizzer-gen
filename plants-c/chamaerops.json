It is characterized by its clustered growth habit and distinctive, fan-shaped leaves that give it its common name. Native to southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, Chamaerops species are typically found in coastal and rocky habitats.

Their adaptability to various environmental conditions makes them popular in horticulture and landscape design."
