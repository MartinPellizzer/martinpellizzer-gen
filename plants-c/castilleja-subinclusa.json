    "intro": "Castilleja subinclusa, commonly known as the narrowleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are often obscured by its showy bracts. It relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. Castilleja subinclusa is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its environment."
