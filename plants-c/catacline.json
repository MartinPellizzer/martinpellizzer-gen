    "intro": "Catacline, commonly known as the cat's claw, is a climbing plant native to South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and distinctive, hooked tendrils that help it climb towards sunlight. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Catacline is widely used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
