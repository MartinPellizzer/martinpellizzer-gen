    "intro": "Clematis alpina f. fauriei, commonly known as the alpine clematis, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale blue. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, silvery down. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
