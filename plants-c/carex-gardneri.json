    "intro": "Carex gardneri, commonly known as Gardner's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers in the summer, which are wind-pollinated. Gardner's sedge is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
