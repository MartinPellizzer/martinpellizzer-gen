It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. This variety typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
