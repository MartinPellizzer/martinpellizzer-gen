    "intro": "Chaetochloa caespitosa, commonly known as tufted hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in saturated soils and is often found in areas with high water tables. Chaetochloa caespitosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
