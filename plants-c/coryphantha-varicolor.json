    "intro": "Coryphantha varicolor, commonly known as the rainbow cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in white to grayish-blue spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
