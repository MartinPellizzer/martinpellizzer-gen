It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet or blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and typically grows in rocky or arid environments. It is often found in open woodlands and along dry streambeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
