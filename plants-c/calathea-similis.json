    "intro": "Calathea similis, commonly known as the pink star calathea, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves with intricate patterns of pink, white, and green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to maintain its vibrant appearance. Its foliage changes color slightly in response to light, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty. Calathea similis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
