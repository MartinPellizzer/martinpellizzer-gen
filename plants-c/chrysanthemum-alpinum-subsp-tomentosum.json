    "intro": "Chrysanthemum alpinum subsp. tomentosum, commonly known as the Alpine woolly chrysanthemum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of dense, soft hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens with full sun exposure."
