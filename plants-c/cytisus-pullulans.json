    "intro": "Cytisus pullulans, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, woody stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, trifoliate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Cytisus pullulans thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats."
