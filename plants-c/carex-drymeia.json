    "intro": "Carex drymeia, commonly known as the dry meadow sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomes help it spread and establish dense colonies in suitable environments. Carex drymeia plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
