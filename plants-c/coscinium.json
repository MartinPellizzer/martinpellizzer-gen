    "intro": "Coscinium, commonly known as the black nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It includes several species, such as Coscinium fenestratum, which is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plants are characterized by their woody stems, alternate leaves, and showy, often purple or green flowers. The berries produced by Coscinium species are typically dark, glossy, and toxic, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals. These botanical features make Coscinium an important plant in both ecological and medicinal contexts."
