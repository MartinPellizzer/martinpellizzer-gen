    "intro": "Carduus nutans var. micropterus, commonly known as the dwarf sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and basal rosettes of deeply lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. Due to its low-growing habit and adaptability, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
