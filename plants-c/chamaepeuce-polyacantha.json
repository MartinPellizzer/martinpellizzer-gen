    "intro": "Chamaepeuce polyacantha, commonly known as the many-thorned chamaepeuce, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in arid landscapes."
