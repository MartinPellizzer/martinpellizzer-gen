    "intro": "Cyperus autumnalis, commonly known as purple flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a distinct purple hue along the edges. The plant produces small, clustered flower spikes that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Cyperus autumnalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland ecosystems."
