    "intro": "Calceolaria huamachucensis, commonly known as the Huamachuca slipper orchid, is a species native to the high Andean regions of Peru. It is characterized by its distinctive calyx-like structure, which resembles a slipper or a pouch, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically during the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous habitats with well-drained soil. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
