    "intro": "Castilleja pallida var. elegans, commonly known as the pale castilleja. This variant is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of other plants to obtain some of its nutrients. It is native to the western United States and is often found in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant produces showy, pink to reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
