    "intro": "Crotalaria sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile leaf cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant features small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, and its leaves are typically ovate with sessile (attached directly to the stem) leaflets. Crotalaria sessilifolia is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain regions."
