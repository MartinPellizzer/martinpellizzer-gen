    "intro": "Cecropia palmata, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, red berries that mature in the fall. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are white and arranged in clusters. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, wooded areas. The berries are toxic when raw but can be made safe for consumption through proper preparation."
