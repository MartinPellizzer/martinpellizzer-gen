    "intro": "Coelogyne pubescens, commonly known as the hairy orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescence and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in seasonal conditions. Its leaves are typically broad and grass-like, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with high humidity. Coelogyne pubescens is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
