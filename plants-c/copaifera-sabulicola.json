    "intro": "Copaifera sabulicola, commonly known as Brazilian copaiba, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and large, compound leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its resin, known as copaiba balsam, has been traditionally used for its medicinal properties. Copaifera sabulicola plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
