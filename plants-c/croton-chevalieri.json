    "intro": "Croton chevalieri, commonly known as the red-veined croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves with vivid red veins contrasting against its dark green or yellowish foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens with suitable conditions."
