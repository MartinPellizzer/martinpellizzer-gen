    "intro": "Cynanchum nipponicum f. rotundifolium, commonly known as the Japanese milkweed or round-leaf milkvetch, is a variant of the Cynanchum genus native to East Asia. It is characterized by its rounded, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is a member of the Asclepiadaceae family, known for its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. This form is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical species, making it a unique ornamental and ecological plant."
