    "intro": "Carduncellus atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic carduncellus, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stalks and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
