    "intro": "Cleistocactus winteri subsp. winteri, commonly known as the Winter's cleistocactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that protect it from intense sunlight and cold temperatures. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, which is unusual for cacti. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts for its ornamental value."
