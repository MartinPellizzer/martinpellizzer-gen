    "intro": "Corothamnus procumbens, commonly known as creeping thimbleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Corothamnus procumbens is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks."
