It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-green hue. Cyperus diffusus produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered at the ends of its stems.
