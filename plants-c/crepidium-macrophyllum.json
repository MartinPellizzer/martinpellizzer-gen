    "intro": "Crepidium macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands and marshes of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces striking, pale green to yellowish flowers that are often clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
