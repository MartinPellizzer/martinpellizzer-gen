    "intro": "Chamaecyparis obtusa var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf Japanese cedar, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen conifer native to Japan. It features a dense, rounded form with scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and silvery-white underneath. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically reddish-brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and small spaces. Its ornamental value comes from its neat appearance and seasonal color changes."
