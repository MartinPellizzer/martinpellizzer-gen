    "intro": "Catasetum spinosum, commonly known as the spiny catasetum, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often spiny floral structures, which are adaptations for its unique pollination mechanism. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with a prominent, club-shaped structure called a gynostemium. Catasetum spinosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
