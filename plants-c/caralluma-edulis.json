    "intro": "Caralluma edulis, commonly known as the devil's tongue or desert apple, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, reducing water loss through transpiration. Caralluma edulis is also noted for its medicinal properties, with traditional uses including appetite suppression and energy enhancement."
