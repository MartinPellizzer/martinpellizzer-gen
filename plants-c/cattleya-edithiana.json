    "intro": "Cattleya edithiana, commonly known as the Edith's orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial with a pseudobulb structure that supports its growth and storage of nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, arranged in a fan-like pattern around the pseudobulb. Cattleya edithiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ease of cultivation under proper conditions."
