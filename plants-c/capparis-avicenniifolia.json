    "intro": "Capparis avicenniifolia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, blue or purple flowers and fleshy, spiny leaves adapted to arid and saline environments. The plant belongs to the Capparaceae family and is often found growing on rocky shores or in sandy soils. Its structure includes a woody stem with thorn-like projections, which help in reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
