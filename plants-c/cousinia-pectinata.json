    "intro": "Cousinia pectinata, commonly known as the woolly cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which helps to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Cousinia pectinata is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
