It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin, membranous indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a notable species within its ecological niche."
