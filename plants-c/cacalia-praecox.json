    "intro": "Cacalia praecox, commonly known as early cacalia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. It blooms early in the spring, typically from April to June, and is known for its rapid growth cycle. Cacalia praecox is often considered a weed due to its invasive tendencies in certain regions."
