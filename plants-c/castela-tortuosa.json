    "intro": "Castela tortuosa, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features distinctive, twisted, and spiraling stems that give it its common name. The plant has small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight waxy coating. It produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Castela tortuosa is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
