    "intro": "Costularia recurva, commonly known as the hairy false nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by bracts. Its leaves are often mistaken for true nettles due to their similar appearance and stinging hairs. Costularia recurva is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in woodland edges."
