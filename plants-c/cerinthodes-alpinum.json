    "intro": "Cerinthodes alpinum, commonly known as the alpine cerinthodes, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it adapts to cold and harsh conditions. The plant features small, delicate flowers that are often white or pale blue in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cerinthodes alpinum plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing food for local wildlife."
