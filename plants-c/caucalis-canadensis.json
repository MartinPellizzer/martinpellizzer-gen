    "intro": "Caucalis canadensis, commonly known as Canada's bluebell, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in wetlands and along streambanks. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, and it produces distinctive, flattened fruits. Caucalis canadensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
