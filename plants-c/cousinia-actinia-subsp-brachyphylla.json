    "intro": "Cousinia actinia subsp. brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-stemmed cushion cinquefoil, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing cushions of foliage, which help it survive in harsh, arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It has thick, hairy leaves that reduce water loss and aid in insulation against cold temperatures. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient component of alpine and steppe ecosystems."
