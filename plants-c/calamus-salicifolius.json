It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including parts of India, China, and Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and long, narrow, willow-like leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spadix, typical of the Araceae family.
