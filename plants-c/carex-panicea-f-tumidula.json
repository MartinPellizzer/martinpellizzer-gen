    "intro": "Carex panicea f. tumidula, commonly known as the inflated sedge, is a variant of the panicled sedge characterized by its distinctive, inflated spikelets. It is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family, typically found in wet or moist habitats such as marshes and wet meadows. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in summer. Its unique morphology, particularly the swollen, boat-shaped spikelets, makes it easily identifiable. This subspecies is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
