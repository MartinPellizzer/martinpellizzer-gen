    "intro": "Calochortus nanus, commonly known as the dwarf mariposa lily, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to California and Baja California. It typically reaches heights of only a few inches, with narrow, grass-like leaves and delicate, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant blooms in late spring to early summer, often in sunny, well-drained habitats such as grasslands and open woodlands. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is adapted to dry, Mediterranean climates. Calochortus nanus is a valued ornamental plant due to its compact size and elegant floral display."
