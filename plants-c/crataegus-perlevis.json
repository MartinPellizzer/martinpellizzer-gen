    "intro": "Crataegus perlevis, commonly known as the white thornapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus perlevis typically grows in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed sites, and it is often found in moist to mesic soils. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant communities and an interesting subject for ecological study."
