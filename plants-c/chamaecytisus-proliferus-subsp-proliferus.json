    "intro": "Chamaecytisus proliferus subsp. proliferus, commonly known as sweet honeycomb bush, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and rocky garden environments. Its ornamental value comes from its fragrant flowers and evergreen foliage."
