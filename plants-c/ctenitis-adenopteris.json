    "intro": "Ctenitis adenopteris, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a thick, fibrous trunk that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Ctenitis adenopteris plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various organisms."
