    "intro": "Cyrtopera rhodesiaca, commonly known as the Rhodesian spider orchid, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, curling petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in areas with moderate to high rainfall. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale yellow, and it is known for its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
