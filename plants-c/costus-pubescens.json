    "intro": "Costus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy costus, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features upright stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by colorful bracts, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Costus pubescens is valued in horticulture for its vibrant flowers and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
