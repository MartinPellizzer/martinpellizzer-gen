    "intro": "Chamaecrista salvatoris, commonly known as the scarlet pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with distinctive red veins, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds. Chamaecrista salvatoris is often found in disturbed soils and open areas, making it a common weed in agricultural fields."
