    "intro": "Cryptandra propinqua var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered cryptandra, is a shrub native to the south-western regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
