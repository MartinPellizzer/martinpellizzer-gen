    "intro": "Cymbidium eburneum var. philbrickianum, commonly known as the Philbrick's orchid, is a rare and prized species native to China. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces strap-like leaves that are often a deep green color with a waxy texture. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctively shaped lip that adds to its ornamental appeal. This variety is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relative hardiness in cooler climates."
