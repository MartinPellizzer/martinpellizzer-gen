    "intro": "Cordia heudelotii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually glossy green. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and woodland areas. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
