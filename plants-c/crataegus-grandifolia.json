    "intro": "Crataegus grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits called pomes, which are edible but often tart. Crataegus grandifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential cardiovascular benefits."
