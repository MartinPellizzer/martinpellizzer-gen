    "intro": "Campanula tridens var. stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking floral display and drought tolerance."
