    "intro": "Campanula pusilla var. parvula, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to both wild and cultivated landscapes."
