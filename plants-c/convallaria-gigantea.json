    "intro": "Convallaria gigantea, commonly known as the giant lily of the valley, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its tall, arching stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals, making it important to handle with care. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in woodland environments. Convallaria gigantea is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in herbal medicine."
