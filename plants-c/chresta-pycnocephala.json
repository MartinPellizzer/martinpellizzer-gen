    "intro": "Chresta pycnocephala, commonly known as the dense-headed chresta, is a flowering plant belonging to the Acanthaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its compact, dense inflorescences that bear small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, with hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are often brightly colored, ranging from red to violet, and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of horticultural circles."
