    "intro": "Crassula tecta, commonly known as the stone rose, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Crassula tecta is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
