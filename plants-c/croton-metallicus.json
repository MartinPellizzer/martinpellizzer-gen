    "intro": "Croton metallicus, commonly known as the silver croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that display a mix of silver, green, and red hues. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by woody, spiny capsules containing its seeds. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its vibrant appearance. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic and should be handled with care."
