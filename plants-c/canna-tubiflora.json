    "intro": "Canna tubiflora, commonly known as the swamp canna, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces striking, orange-red flowers with long, slender bracts that resemble petals. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in swampy areas or along riverbanks. Canna tubiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
