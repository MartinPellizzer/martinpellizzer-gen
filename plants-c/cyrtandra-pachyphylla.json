    "intro": "Cyrtandra pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved cyrtandra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the islands of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its often humid and shaded habitats. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Cyrtandra pachyphylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and unique floral structure."
