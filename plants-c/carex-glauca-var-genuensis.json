    "intro": "Carex glauca var. genuensis, commonly known as the Blue-green sedge, is a perennial plant native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, which distinguish it from other sedges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other wet or damp habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
