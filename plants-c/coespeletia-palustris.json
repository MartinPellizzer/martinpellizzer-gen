    "intro": "Coespeletia palustris, commonly known as the swamp hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly in regions of Colombia and Ecuador. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetland or marshy environments. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellow throat. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and usually have a rough texture. Coespeletia palustris plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland areas."
