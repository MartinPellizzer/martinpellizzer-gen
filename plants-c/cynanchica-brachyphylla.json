    "intro": "Cynanchica brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its stout, hairy stems and compound leaves with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in racemes, followed by pods that contain kidney-shaped seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surfaces. Cynanchica brachyphylla is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
