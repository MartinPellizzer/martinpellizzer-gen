    "intro": "Cephaelis sororiella, commonly known as the pink-flowered rock heath, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 12,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered pink or white flowers and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. The leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat."
