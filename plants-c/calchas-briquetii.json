    "intro": "Calchas briquetii, commonly known as the Mediterranean orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and striking, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Calchas briquetii is considered endangered in many regions."
