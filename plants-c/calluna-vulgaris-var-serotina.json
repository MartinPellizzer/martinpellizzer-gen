    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris var. serotina, commonly known as late-flowering heather, is a variant of the common heather native to parts of Europe and North America. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the year. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
