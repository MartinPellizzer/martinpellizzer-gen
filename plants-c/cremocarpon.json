    "intro": "Cremocarpon, commonly known as the \"buttercup lichen,\" is a type of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. The plant forms a crust-like growth on rocks, tree bark, and soil surfaces, often in shaded, humid environments. Its thallus is leathery and can vary in color from yellowish to greenish-brown. Cremocarpon plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
