    "intro": "Clidemia melanotricha, commonly known as the velvetleaf or black-haired mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees and shrubs, drawing water and nutrients from its host through specialized roots. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are followed by bright red berries that attract various bird species. Clidemia melanotricha plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to forest biodiversity."
