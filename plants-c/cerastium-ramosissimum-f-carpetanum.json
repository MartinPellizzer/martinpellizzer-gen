    "intro": "Cerastium ramosissimum f. carpetanum, commonly known as the carpet cinquefoil, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form a thick, carpet-like ground cover. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a resilient plant in challenging conditions."
