    "intro": "Chrysogonum coriaceum, commonly known as the rough chrysogonum, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, giving them a leathery texture. Its small yellow flowers bloom in late summer, forming dense clusters at the tips of the stems. The plant is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies."
