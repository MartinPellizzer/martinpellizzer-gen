    "intro": "Crataegus villaris, commonly known as the sandcherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and features thorned branches, which are a characteristic feature of the genus Crataegus. The plant produces white to pink flowers in spring, followed by small, red, fleshy fruits known as pomes. Its leaves are oval with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn. The sandcherry is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun conditions."
