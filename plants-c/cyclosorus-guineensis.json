    "intro": "Cyclosorus guineensis, commonly known as the African water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its floating, leaf-like structures that form a rosette shape. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and rice fields. Its leaves are divided into small, rounded segments, and it produces tiny, free-floating fruits that aid in its dispersal. Cyclosorus guineensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
