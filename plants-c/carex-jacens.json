    "intro": "Carex jacens, commonly known as the prostrate sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Carex jacens is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
