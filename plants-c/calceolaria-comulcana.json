    "intro": "Calceolaria comulcana, commonly known as the Andean slipper orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, adapting to its cold, mountainous environment. Calceolaria comulcana thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it is relatively rare in cultivation."
