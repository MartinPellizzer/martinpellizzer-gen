    "intro": "Crenamum, commonly known as the crenate-leaved plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive crenate or wavy-edged leaves, which give it its common name. The flowers are typically composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, and are often yellow or orange in color. These plants are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in woodland or grassland habitats. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
