    "intro": "Cormophyllum capense, commonly known as the Cape cormophyllum, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, adding ornamental value. Its corm-like stems are adapted for survival in dry conditions, and it is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils. Cormophyllum capense is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
