    "intro": "Carex forbesii, commonly known as Forbes' sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered flowers that are often green or brown, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Carex forbesii is also valued for its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
