    "intro": "Corispermum purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-flowered bladderwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as wet meadows and tundra. Its reproductive structures include small, bladder-like organs that aid in seed dispersal. Corispermum purpurascens plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitats and is adapted to survive in low temperatures and short growing seasons."
