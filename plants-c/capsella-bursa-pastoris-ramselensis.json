It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its small, alternate leaves and clusters of white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces small, round seeds enclosed in a structure called a silique, which is typical of the mustard family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in many regions."
