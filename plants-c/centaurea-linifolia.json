    "intro": "Centaurea linifolia, commonly known as sweet everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and bright blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Centaurea linifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
