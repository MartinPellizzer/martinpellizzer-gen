    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. racemosa, commonly known as the European hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10\u201320 cm long and composed of 5\u20139 oval leaflets. The plant produces catkins in early spring, with male and female flowers on separate plants, and edible nuts that mature in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its nuts and ornamental value. The variety racemosa is distinguished by its longer, more elongated catkins compared to other hazelnut varieties."
