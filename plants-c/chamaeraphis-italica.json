It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as coastal areas and salt marshes. The plant features succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid or salty conditions. Its small, greenish flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Chamaeraphis italica plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
