    "intro": "Cochlearia draba, commonly known as the rock scurvygrass, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in rocky or coastal areas. The plant has tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Cochlearia draba is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine or maritime climates."
