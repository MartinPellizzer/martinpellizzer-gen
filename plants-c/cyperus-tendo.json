    "intro": "Cyperus tendo, commonly known as the common flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense mats near water bodies. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are usually wind-pollinated. Cyperus tendo is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
