    "intro": "Corylus mandshurica f. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular hazel, is a variant of the mandshurian hazel. It is characterized by its glandular structures on the leaves and stems, which are distinctive botanical features. This plant typically grows in temperate regions, often in forested areas with well-drained soil. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces edible nuts similar to other hazel species. The glandular hairs on its surfaces may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and pathogens."
