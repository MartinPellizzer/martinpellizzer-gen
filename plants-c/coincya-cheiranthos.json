    "intro": "Coincya cheiranthos, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
