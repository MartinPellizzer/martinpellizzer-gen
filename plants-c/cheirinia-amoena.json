    "intro": "Cheirinia amoena, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to arid environments. Cheirinia amoena is often found in sandy or rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
