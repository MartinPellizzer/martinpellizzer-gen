    "intro": "Camaridium amparoanum, commonly known as the Amparo orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of the Andes, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant features intricate, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern that ranges from deep violet to pale lavender. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil of its high-altitude habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
