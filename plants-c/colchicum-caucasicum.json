It features striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from August to September. The plant has a distinctive corm-like structure that stores nutrients, enabling it to survive harsh winters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from the base of the plant. Colchicum caucasicum is also noted for its medicinal properties, containing alkaloids used in the treatment of gout and other inflammatory conditions."
