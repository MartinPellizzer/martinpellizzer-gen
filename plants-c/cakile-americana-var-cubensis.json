    "intro": "Cakile americana var. cubensis, commonly known as Cuban sandspurry, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Caribbean region, including Cuba. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
