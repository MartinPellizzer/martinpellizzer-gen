    "intro": "Carex bonplandii var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear green to brown flowers. It is a clump-forming plant that spreads slowly through rhizomes, making it a good candidate for wetland restoration projects. Its botanical structure is adapted to waterlogged soils, with a fibrous root system that helps stabilize the soil and filter water."
