It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive ash-gray coloration. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats.
