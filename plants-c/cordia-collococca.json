    "intro": "Cordia collococca, commonly known as the red cedar or Australian red cedar, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry forests. Cordia collococca is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments."
