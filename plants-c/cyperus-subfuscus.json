    "intro": "Cyperus subfuscus, commonly known as the black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Cyperus subfuscus produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in panicles. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
