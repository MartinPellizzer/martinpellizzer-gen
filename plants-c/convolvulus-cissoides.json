    "intro": "Convolvulus cissoides, commonly known as the creeping woodbine, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a sprawling perennial that features heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has a strong, climbing habit and often forms dense mats on the ground. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or sandy habitats. Its ability to spread rapidly makes it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in certain environments."
