    "intro": "Cotoneaster salicifolius, commonly known as the willow-leaved cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, willow-like leaves that are opposite and ovate, often with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Cotoneaster salicifolius is relatively low-maintenance and resistant to pests and diseases."
