    "intro": "Cyperus esculentus var. phymatodes, commonly known as the spiny flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features rhizomatous growth and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine, spiny hairs. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, often forming dense stands. Its botanical characteristics make it both ecologically significant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
