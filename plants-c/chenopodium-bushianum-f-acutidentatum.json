It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. Its succulent stems and leaves make it drought-tolerant, adapting well to arid environments. This form is distinguished by its acute leaf teeth, which contribute to its unique botanical identification."
