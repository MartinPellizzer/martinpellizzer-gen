    "intro": "Crassula nodulosa, commonly known as the African Snowball, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of fleshy, rounded leaves that give it a compact, snowball-like appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Crassula nodulosa thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
