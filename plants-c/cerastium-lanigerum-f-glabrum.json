    "intro": "Cerastium lanigerum f. glabrum, commonly known as the glabrous mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, white flowers. The plant has rounded, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the 'glabrum' form is hairless. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, producing a cluster of five petals and aiding in pollination by insects."
