    "intro": "Cerasus incisa f. chrysantha, commonly known as the Japanese apricot or cherry blossom, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its showy, single or double pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar to cherries but are often used in jams and preserves. Its ornamental value is highly appreciated in gardens and public spaces for its beautiful floral display. The leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall, adding to its seasonal appeal."
