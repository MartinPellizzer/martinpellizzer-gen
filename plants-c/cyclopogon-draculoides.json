    "intro": "Cyclopogon draculoides, commonly known as the dragon's blood cycad, is a unique member of the cycad family native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of narrow, feather-like leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its name is derived from the reddish-brown sap it exudes, which resembles the mythical \"dragon's blood.\" Due to its rarity and ecological importance, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and over-collection."
