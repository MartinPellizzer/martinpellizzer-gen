    "intro": "Cercouratea magdalenae, commonly known as the Magdalena fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
