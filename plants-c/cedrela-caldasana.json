    "intro": "Cedrela caldasana, commonly known as the Caldasana mahogany, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly found in Colombia and Venezuela. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its straight, durable wood that is highly valued for its fine grain and workability. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a broad, spreading canopy and large, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. Due to its economic importance and habitat loss, Cedrela caldasana is considered a threatened species in its native range."
