It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it ideal for woodland gardens or shaded borders. The plant produces small, inconspicuous brown flowers in late spring, which are followed by distinctive, triangular seed heads. Its foliage color variation adds visual interest, making it a popular choice for moisture-loving garden settings."
