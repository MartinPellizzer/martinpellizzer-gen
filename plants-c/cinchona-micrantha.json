    "intro": "Cinchona micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and striking red flowers. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that contain the seeds. It is notable for its historical use in the production of quinine, although it is less commercially significant than other cinchona species. The plant's botanical features make it an important subject in both horticulture and pharmacological research."
