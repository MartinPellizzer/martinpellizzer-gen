    "intro": "Cyathea glauca, commonly known as the silver tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive silvery-blue sheen on its fronds, which is due to a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Cyathea glauca plays an important role in New Zealand's native ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
