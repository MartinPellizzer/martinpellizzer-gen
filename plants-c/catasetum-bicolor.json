    "intro": "Catasetum bicolor, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are pollinated by specific bees that are attracted by the unique structure of the labellum. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
