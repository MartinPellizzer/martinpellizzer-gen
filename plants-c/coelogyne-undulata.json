    "intro": "Coelogyne undulata, commonly known as the wavy orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, wavy-crested flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees or rocks, and it thrives in humid, tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive periods of drought. Coelogyne undulata is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
