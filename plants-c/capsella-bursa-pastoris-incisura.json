    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris incisura, commonly known as the \"blessed lady\" or \"common chickweed,\" is an annual flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and alternate, spoon-shaped leaves that are often notched or lobed. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive triangular seed pods. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a common weed in many regions."
