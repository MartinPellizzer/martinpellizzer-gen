    "intro": "Commicarpus fallacissimus, commonly known as the deceptive false holly, is a flowering plant native to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean. It is a small shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It thrives in coastal and sandy habitats, often growing in dense thickets. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
