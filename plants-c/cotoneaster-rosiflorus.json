    "intro": "Cotoneaster rosiflorus, commonly known as the rose-flowered cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It features small, white to pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to horticultural landscapes. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for ornamental planting."
