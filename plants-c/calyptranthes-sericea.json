    "intro": "Calyptranthes sericea, commonly known as the silverleaf calyptranthes, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, silky hairs. Its small, white flowers are typically arranged in clusters and bloom in the spring. Calyptranthes sericea is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
