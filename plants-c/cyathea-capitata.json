    "intro": "Cyathea capitata, commonly known as the crowned tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant has a distinctive crown of short, clustered fronds at the top of its trunk, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators."
