    "intro": "Ceanothus foliosus var. medius, commonly known as the middleleaf ceanothus, is a shrub native to California and parts of Nevada. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping. This variety is also valued for its ability to support local pollinators and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
