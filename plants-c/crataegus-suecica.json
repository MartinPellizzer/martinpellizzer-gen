    "intro": "Crataegus suecica, commonly known as the Swedish hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to elliptic leaves, and clusters of small white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits called pomes in the autumn, which are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus suecica is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
