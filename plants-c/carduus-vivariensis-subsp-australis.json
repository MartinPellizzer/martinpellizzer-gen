    "intro": "Carduus vivariensis subsp. australis, commonly known as the Australian thistle, is a perennial herb native to southern Australia. It features robust, upright stems covered in coarse, prickly hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom from spring to autumn, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. It is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas."
