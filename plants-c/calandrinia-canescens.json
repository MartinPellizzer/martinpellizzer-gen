    "intro": "Calandrinia canescens, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Portulacaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, vibrant flowers that typically open in the morning and close by midday, a trait that gives it its common name. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and are followed by capsule fruits that contain several seeds. Calandrinia canescens is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
