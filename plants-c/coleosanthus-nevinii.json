    "intro": "Coleosanthus nevinii, commonly known as the Nevin's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of Tonga in the South Pacific. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human activities. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species."
