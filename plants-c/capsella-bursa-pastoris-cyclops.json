    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris cyclops, commonly known as the velvetleaf or shepherd's purse, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular seed pods, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is widespread across temperate regions. It has small, alternate leaves and produces yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a common weed and a subject of ecological study."
