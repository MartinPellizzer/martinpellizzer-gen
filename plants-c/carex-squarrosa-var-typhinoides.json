    "intro": "Carex squarrosa var. typhinoides, commonly known as the Typhinoides sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant features grass-like leaves that are often reddish or purplish at the base, and it produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers in the summer. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and form dense colonies. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
