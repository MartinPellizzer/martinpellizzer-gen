    "intro": "Carex sylvatica subsp. latifrons, commonly known as the broad-fruited sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and clustered spikes of small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The subspecies is distinguished by its broader, more robust flower spikes compared to the typical form of *Carex sylvatica*."
