    "intro": "Cynanchum matsudanum, commonly known as the Japanese milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicle fruits containing seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
