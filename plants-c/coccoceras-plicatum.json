    "intro": "Coccoceras plicatum, commonly known as the pleated coccolith, is a type of marine phytoplankton belonging to the class Prymnesiophyceae. It is characterized by its complex calcified plates, known as coccoliths, which are arranged in a distinctive pleated pattern. These plates serve as a protective structure and aid in buoyancy, allowing the organism to remain suspended in the water column. Coccoceras plicatum is found in coastal and open ocean waters, contributing to primary productivity and forming the base of marine food webs. Its presence is often used as an indicator of environmental conditions in marine ecosystems."
