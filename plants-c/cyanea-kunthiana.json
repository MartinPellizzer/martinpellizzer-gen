    "intro": "Cyanea kunthiana, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with a deep root system and thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Cyanea kunthiana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing nectar and habitat for various desert wildlife."
