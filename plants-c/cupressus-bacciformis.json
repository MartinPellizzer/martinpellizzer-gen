    "intro": "Cupressus bacciformis, commonly known as the Mexican red-cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, columnar form and dark reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, fibrous strips. The foliage consists of scale-like leaves, which are typically reddish in color, giving the tree its common name. It produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils in temperate climates."
