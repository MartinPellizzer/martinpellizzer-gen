    "intro": "Castanea vesca var. argentata, commonly known as the silver-hair chestnut, is a variant of the sweet chestnut characterized by its distinctive silver-gray pubescence on the young shoots and leaves. This variety is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and is closely related to the common chestnut. The leaves are lanceolate, with a finely hairy surface, and the flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female inflorescences. The fruit is a spiny bur, containing one or two edible nuts, and it matures in the autumn. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is less common than other chestnut species."
