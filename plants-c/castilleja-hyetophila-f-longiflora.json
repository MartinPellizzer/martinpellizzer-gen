    "intro": "Castilleja hyetophila f. longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered rain castilleja, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes parasitic and hemiparasitic species. This subspecies is characterized by its slender stems and showy, pink to reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. The plant's parasitic nature allows it to derive some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants."
