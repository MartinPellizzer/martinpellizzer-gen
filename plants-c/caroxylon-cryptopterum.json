    "intro": "Caroxylon cryptopterum, commonly known as the cryptopterum cycad, is a rare and ancient cycad species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, needle-like leaves that give it a prehistoric appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires minimal water once established. Due to its endangered status, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
