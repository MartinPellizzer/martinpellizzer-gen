It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and slightly fleshy, adapted to store water in the humid, shaded environments it prefers.
