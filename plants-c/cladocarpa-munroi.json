    "intro": "Cladocarpa munroi, commonly known as the New Zealand whitebeam, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and dense, rounded crown. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, red berries that are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in forest margins and rocky areas. Cladocarpa munroi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat."
