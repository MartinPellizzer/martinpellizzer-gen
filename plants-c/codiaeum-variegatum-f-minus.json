    "intro": "Codiaeum variegatum f. minus, commonly known as the variegated croton, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, multicolored leaves that display shades of green, yellow, red, and orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is valued for its foliage rather than its flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance, it is popular in indoor gardening and as a decorative plant in tropical landscapes."
