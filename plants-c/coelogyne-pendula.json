    "intro": "Coelogyne pendula, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. The flowers, which can be white, yellow, or orange, bloom during the rainy season and attract various pollinators."
