    "intro": "Cyclosorus subattenuatus, commonly known as the slender water shield, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water surface. Cyclosorus subattenuatus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
