    "intro": "Castilleja schaffneri var. cinerascens, commonly known as the cinerascens paintbrush, is a species of flowering plant in the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. The plant is characterized by its showy, red to orange-red bracts that resemble paintbrushes, which are actually modified leaves. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands in the western United States. This variety is distinguished by its pale, ashy-colored stems and leaves, giving it its scientific name."
