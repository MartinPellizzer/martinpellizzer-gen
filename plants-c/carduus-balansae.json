    "intro": "Carduus balansae, commonly known as the Balansae thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky, or disturbed soils and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant has a robust taproot system, which helps it survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with rough, bristly textures, and the flowers are clustered in a globular head. Carduus balansae is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides."
