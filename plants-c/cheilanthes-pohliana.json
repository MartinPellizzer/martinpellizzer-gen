    "intro": "Cheilanthes pohliana, commonly known as the Pohli's rockcap, is a species of fern native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and in arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Cheilanthes pohliana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
