    "intro": "Cerasus leveilleana f. pubipes, commonly known as the pubescent cherry, is a botanical variant of the cherry species characterized by its hairy or pubescent foliage. This plant is native to certain regions of China and is typically found in forested areas with moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar to other cherry species. The pubescent trait is most evident on the leaves and stems, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in botanical collections."
