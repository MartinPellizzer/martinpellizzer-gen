    "intro": "Carex, commonly known as sedges, are grass-like plants belonging to the Cyperaceae family. They are typically found in moist or wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Carex plants have triangular stems and produce small, clustered flowers that are often wind-pollinated. Their leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Many species of Carex are important in ecological systems for soil stabilization and providing habitat for wildlife."
