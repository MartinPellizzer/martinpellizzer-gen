    "intro": "Calydorea xiphioides, commonly known as the slender flame plant, is a rare and striking member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its elongated, tubular flowers that range in color from orange to red, resembling small flames. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in specialized greenhouses and botanical gardens."
