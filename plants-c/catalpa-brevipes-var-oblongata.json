    "intro": "Catalpa brevipes var. oblongata, commonly known as the narrowleaf catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical Catalpa brevipes. The tree produces showy, pendulous clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, developing fissures with age. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance in the region."
