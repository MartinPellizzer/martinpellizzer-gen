    "intro": "Carduus ciliolatus, commonly known as the silky thistle, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its leaves and flowers are used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
