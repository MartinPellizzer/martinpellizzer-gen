    "intro": "Chimaphila monticola subsp. taiwaniana, commonly known as the Taiwan Christmas moss, is a rare evergreen shrub native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with dense clusters of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, appearing in late winter to early spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions with acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
