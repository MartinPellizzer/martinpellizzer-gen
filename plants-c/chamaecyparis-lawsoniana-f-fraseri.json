    "intro": "Chamaecyparis lawsoniana f. fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser fir, is a rare and ornamental variant of the Lawson cypress. It is characterized by its dense, conical shape and scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and silvery white underneath. The plant is native to the Appalachian Mountains in the southeastern United States, where it thrives in cool, moist, and well-drained soils. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green cones that are typically found on the female plants. This cultivar is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its unique foliage and slow growth rate."
