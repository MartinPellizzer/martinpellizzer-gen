    "intro": "Carex bequaertii subsp. mossii, commonly known as the mossy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as wetlands and forest floors. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. The subspecies mossii is distinguished by its compact growth and specific habitat preferences compared to other Carex species."
