    "intro": "Coccothrinax clarensis subsp. clarensis, commonly known as the Clarendon palm, is a small, slow-growing palm native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its slender trunk and pinnate, feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun exposure. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to salt spray and wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
