    "intro": "Crocus vernus var. marginatus, commonly known as the purple crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features striking violet to purple flowers with distinctive white or cream margins, blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and ability to naturalize over time."
