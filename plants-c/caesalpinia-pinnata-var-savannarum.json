It is characterized by its bright yellow, flame-like inflorescences that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open when mature. The species is adapted to dry, open habitats and is often found in savannas and woodland edges."
