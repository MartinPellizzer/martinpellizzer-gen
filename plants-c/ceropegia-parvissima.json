    "intro": "Ceropegia parvissima, commonly known as the dwarf string of hearts, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, trailing stems with heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale green, which are pollinated by specific moths. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its compact growth habit, it is a popular choice for hanging baskets or as a trailing plant in containers."
