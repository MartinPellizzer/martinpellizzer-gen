    "intro": "Cyclosorus callensii, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and bright yellow to golden-green leaves that form intricate, star-shaped patterns. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its small, spirally arranged leaves are often covered in a fine layer of translucent cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Cyclosorus callensii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in bog gardens and terrariums."
