    "intro": "Cotoneaster alaunicus var. andesiticus, commonly known as the Andesite Cotoneaster, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
