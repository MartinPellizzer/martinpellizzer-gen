    "intro": "Crepis tunetana, commonly known as the Tunisian mouse-ear, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to North Africa, particularly Tunisia, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, basal rosettes of silver-gray, hairy leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow and occur in small clusters, contributing to its ornamental value. Crepis tunetana is adapted to poor soils and can be found in rocky areas and along coastal dunes."
