    "intro": "Cornus peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian cornel, is a deciduous shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cornaceae and is characterized by its small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a serrated margin. Cornus peruviana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its seasonal interest."
