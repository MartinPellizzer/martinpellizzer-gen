    "intro": "Cyclosorus transitorius, commonly known as the temporary water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it can thrive in slow-moving water. The plant has slender, branching stems that float on the water surface, with small, oval leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowers are inconspicuous, consisting of three sepals and three petals, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Due to its delicate nature, it is often considered a temporary inhabitant of its environment, hence its common name."
