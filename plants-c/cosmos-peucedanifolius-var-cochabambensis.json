    "intro": "Cosmos peucedanifolius var. cochabambensis, commonly known as the Cochabamba cosmos, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of Bolivia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or arid soils, and is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native habitat. Its foliage consists of finely divided, fern-like leaves, and it produces small, spiky fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climatic conditions."
