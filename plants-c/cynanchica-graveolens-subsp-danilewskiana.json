    "intro": "Cynanchica graveolens subsp. danilewskiana, commonly known as the Siberian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the colder regions of Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across alpine and steppe habitats."
