    "intro": "Camphorata annua, commonly known as the annual camphor plant, is an herbaceous species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that vary in shape from ovate to lanceolate. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Camphorata annua is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
