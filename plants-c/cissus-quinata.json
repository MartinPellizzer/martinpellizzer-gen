    "intro": "Cissus quinata, commonly known as the stonecrop fig or Indian nettle, is a climbing vine native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, translucent glands. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically consumed raw or cooked. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Cissus quinata is also valued as a ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and ability to climb various structures."
