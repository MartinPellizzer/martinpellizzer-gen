    "intro": "Callitriche autumnalis f. linophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf water starwort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and the edges of lakes. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are usually broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps it float on water. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late summer to early autumn. This variety is distinguished by its larger, more robust leaves compared to the typical form of Callitriche autumnalis."
