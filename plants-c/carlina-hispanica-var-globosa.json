    "intro": "Carlina hispanica var. globosa, commonly known as the globe thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its spherical, blue-gray flower heads that resemble small globes, surrounded by spiky, silver-green bracts. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Carlina hispanica var. globosa is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy growth habit."
