    "intro": "Corylus tubulosa var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple-husk hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive purple bracts that encase the female flowers, which are often more prominent than the male flowers. The plant produces small, edible nuts enclosed in a tubular husk, which turns brown as it matures. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for wildlife."
