    "intro": "Carex salina subsp. mutica, commonly known as the salt marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. This subspecies thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often found in estuaries and tidal marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in coastal environments. The plant plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to sediment retention."
