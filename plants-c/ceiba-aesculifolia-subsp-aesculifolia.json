    "intro": "Ceiba aesculifolia subsp. aesculifolia, commonly known as the ceiba tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and parts of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its massive, buttressed roots and towering height, often reaching up to 40 meters. The tree produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its bark is thick and fibrous, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitats. The ceiba tree is also culturally significant in many indigenous communities."
