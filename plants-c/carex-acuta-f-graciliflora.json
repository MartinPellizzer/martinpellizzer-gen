    "intro": "Carex acuta f. graciliflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered spike-rush, is a variant of the common spike-rush, characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and reduced inflorescence. It is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or wet meadows. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense clumps that contribute to soil stabilization. The foliage is often a distinguishing feature, with a narrow, grass-like appearance that aids in its identification."
