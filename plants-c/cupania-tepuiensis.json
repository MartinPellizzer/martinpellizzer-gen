It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species, often found in cloud forests at high altitudes."
