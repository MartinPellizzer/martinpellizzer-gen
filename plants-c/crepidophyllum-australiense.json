    "intro": "Crepidophyllum australiense, commonly known as the Australian rock fig, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy, dark green appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in coastal heathlands. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
