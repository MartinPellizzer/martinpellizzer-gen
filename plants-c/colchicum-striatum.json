    "intro": "Colchicum striatum, commonly known as the spotted autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to regions of Europe and western Asia. It features striking, violet-blue flowers with distinctive white spots on the petals, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous corm, which serves as its storage organ. Its flowers are typically surrounded by three leaf-like bracts, and it produces red or orange berries that contain the seeds. Colchicum striatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
