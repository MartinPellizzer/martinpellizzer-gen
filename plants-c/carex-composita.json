The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically brown or reddish in color, arranged in spikelets. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Carex composita is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
