    "intro": "Cranichis monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, broad leaf and a solitary flower that typically blooms in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often growing on rocky slopes or in shaded areas. Its flowers are usually violet or purple in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
