    "intro": "Coelogyne benkii, commonly known as the Benkii orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a pseudobulb with long, narrow leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant typically blooms during the dry season, with flower spikes emerging from the base of the pseudobulb. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Coelogyne benkii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
