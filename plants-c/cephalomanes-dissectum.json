    "intro": "Cephalomanes dissectum, commonly known as the dissected-headed sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian belonging to the order Actiniaria. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated body with a prominent, divided oral disc that gives it its common name. The tentacles are arranged in a circular pattern around the mouth and are used for capturing prey. This species typically inhabits shallow coastal waters and is often found attached to rocks or other substrates. Its delicate structure and vibrant coloration make it a visually striking organism in its marine environment."
