    "intro": "Corallorhiza maculata var. punicea, commonly known as the spotted coralroot, is a terrestrial orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. It is a herbaceous perennial with a slender, branching stem that bears clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is found in the eastern United States. Its flowers are usually less than an inch in diameter and have a tubular shape with two lips. Due to its reliance on specific fungal associations, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed forest ecosystems."
