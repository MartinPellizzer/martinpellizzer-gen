    "intro": "Cheirolepis kotschyi, commonly known as the mountain cypress, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and compact, pyramidal growth habit. The plant exhibits remarkable adaptations to cold and arid conditions, including a slow growth rate and thick, waxy foliage. Its cones are small and clustered, containing winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cheirolepis kotschyi is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
