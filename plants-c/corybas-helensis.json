    "intro": "Corybas helensis, commonly known as the Hellenic hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like floral structure that encloses the reproductive organs, a feature typical of the Corybas genus. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a dark violet or purple hue, often with intricate patterns on its petals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
