    "intro": "Campanopsis brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually ovate and glossy, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom during the wet season. Campanopsis brasiliensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
