    "intro": "Crataegus paineana, commonly known as the Paine's hawthorn, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas of Georgia and South Carolina. The plant is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, juicy berries in the fall. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces thorned stems, which are a distinguishing feature. Crataegus paineana is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats."
