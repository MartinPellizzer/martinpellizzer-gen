    "intro": "Cyperus almensis, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant has slender, triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a dense cluster at the base. Cyperus almensis thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. Its botanical features make it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, contributing to its ecological significance in wetland ecosystems."
