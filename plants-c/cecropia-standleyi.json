    "intro": "Cecropia standleyi, commonly known as the giant cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive, hollow stems that provide habitat for various organisms. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with ants, which reside in the hollow stems and protect the tree from herbivores. Its rapid growth rate makes it an important component of secondary forests and successional ecosystems. Cecropia standleyi also plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitats."
