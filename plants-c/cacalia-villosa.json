    "intro": "Cacalia villosa, commonly known as the hairy bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often with a violet or purple tinge. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name and help it retain moisture in arid environments. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Cacalia villosa is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and is relatively low maintenance."
