    "intro": "Cuellaria revoluta, commonly known as the African sandmat, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Cuellaria revoluta is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
