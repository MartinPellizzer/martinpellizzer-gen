    "intro": "Chorizema varium, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Chorizema varium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
