    "intro": "Canna formosa, commonly known as the red canna, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, often with a reddish or purple tinge. The plant produces showy, spadix-like flowers surrounded by large, colorful bracts, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Canna formosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
