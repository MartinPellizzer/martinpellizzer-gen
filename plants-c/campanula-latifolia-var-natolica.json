    "intro": "Campanula latifolia var. natolica, commonly known as the broadleaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically ranging in color from blue to violet. The leaves are broad and ovate, often with a slightly hairy texture. This species thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
