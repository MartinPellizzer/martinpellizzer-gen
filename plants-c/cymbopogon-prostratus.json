    "intro": "Cymbopogon prostratus, commonly known as prostrate lemon grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that emit a strong citrus aroma. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences and is often used in traditional medicine for its aromatic and medicinal properties. Its essential oils, rich in citral, are valued for their antimicrobial and therapeutic benefits. Cymbopogon prostratus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in wetlands and along water bodies."
