    "intro": "Crataegus verna, commonly known as the spring hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its early blooming habit, producing clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for gardens and natural landscapes. Crataegus verna is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and pollinators."
