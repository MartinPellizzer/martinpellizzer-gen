    "intro": "Cryptosepalum tetraphyllum, commonly known as the four-lobed cryptosepalum, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring four distinct sepals that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
