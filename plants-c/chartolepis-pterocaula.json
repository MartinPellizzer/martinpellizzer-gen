    "intro": "Chartolepis pterocaula, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and purple, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and drought conditions. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often found in rocky outcrops and gravelly plains."
