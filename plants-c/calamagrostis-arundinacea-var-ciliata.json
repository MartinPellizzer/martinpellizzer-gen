    "intro": "Calamagrostis arundinacea var. ciliata, commonly known as the silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blue-green leaves with a distinctive silvery fringe along the edges. This variety thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its graceful appearance and ability to form dense, attractive clumps. It is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
