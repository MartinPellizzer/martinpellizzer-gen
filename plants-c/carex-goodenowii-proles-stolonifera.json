    "intro": "Carex goodenowii proles stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and is often found in shaded environments. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
