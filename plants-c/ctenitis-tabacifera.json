    "intro": "Ctenitis tabacifera, commonly known as the tobacco-leaf fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, slightly serrated margin. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
