    "intro": "Coffea oyemensis, commonly known as the Oyemensis coffee, is a lesser-known species of the coffee genus native to the highlands of western Ethiopia. It is a small evergreen shrub that produces small, red berries containing the seeds used for coffee production. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil, typical of its native habitat. It is valued for its unique flavor profile, which includes floral and citrus notes. Due to its limited cultivation and genetic diversity, it is considered a rare and potentially important species for coffee biodiversity."
