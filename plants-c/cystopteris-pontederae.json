    "intro": "Cystopteris pontederae, commonly known as the Italian water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in water, adapting to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It is native to Europe, Asia, and parts of Africa, typically found in wetlands and along stream edges. Cystopteris pontederae plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
