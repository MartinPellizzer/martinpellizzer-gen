    "intro": "Cnestis mimosoides, commonly known as the mimosa tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which resemble the feathery foliage of the mimosa pudica, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the spring. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Cnestis mimosoides thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sunlight to flourish."
