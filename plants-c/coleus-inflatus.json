    "intro": "Coleus inflatus, commonly known as the inflated coleus, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored with shades of red, purple, and green. The plant's most distinctive feature is its unique, inflated bracts that resemble small, balloon-like structures. These bracts are not only ornamental but also serve as a means of attracting pollinators. Coleus inflatus thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses."
