    "intro": "Cardamine nasturtii, commonly known as watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery, tangy flavor due to the presence of glucosinolates. The plant is often cultivated for its nutritional value and is rich in vitamins A, C, and K."
