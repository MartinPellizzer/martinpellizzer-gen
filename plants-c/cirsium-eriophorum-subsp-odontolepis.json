It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are visited by various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity.
