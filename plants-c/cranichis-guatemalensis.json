    "intro": "Cranichis guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. It has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form colonies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in some areas."
