    "intro": "Cotoneaster himalaiensis, commonly known as the Himalayan cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are usually oval to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small, pinkish-white, and appear in clusters, followed by red or orange berries that are a source of food for birds and small mammals. Cotoneaster himalaiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
