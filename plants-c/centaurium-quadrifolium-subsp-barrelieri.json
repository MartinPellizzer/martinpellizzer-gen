    "intro": "Centaurium quadrifolium subsp. barrelieri, commonly known as the Barrelier's four-leaf centaury, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, clustered blue to purple flowers and its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The subspecies is distinguished by its four-lobed leaves, which give it its specific epithet *quadrifolium*. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been the subject of botanical studies due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
