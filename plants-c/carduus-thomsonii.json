    "intro": "Carduus thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's thistle, is a perennial plant native to western North America. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and open woodlands. The plant features a robust stem with spiny leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Thomson's thistle is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
