It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and striking purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The subspecies adonidifolia is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly different floral structure compared to the typical form. Native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region, it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. This plant is often found in open woodlands and along coastal areas, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
