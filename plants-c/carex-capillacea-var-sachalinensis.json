    "intro": "Carex capillacea var. sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sachalin sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to East Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in wet environments and its rhizomatous growth habit. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
