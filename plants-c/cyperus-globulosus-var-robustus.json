    "intro": "Cyperus globulosus var. robustus, commonly known as the globe sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in suitable environments. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
