    "intro": "Cookia dulcis, commonly known as the sweetleaf tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, round, yellow-orange fruits. The fruits contain a single seed enclosed in a fibrous pulp, which is used in traditional medicine and as a food source. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
