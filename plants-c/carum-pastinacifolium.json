    "intro": "Carum pastinacifolium, commonly known as giant parsley or pastinaca, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like carrots and dill. The plant is characterized by its large, deeply lobed leaves that resemble those of parsley, and its yellow flowers that appear in umbels. It is often grown for its edible leaves and roots, which have a slightly peppery flavor. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks."
