    "intro": "Clivia, commonly known as the bush lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaryllidaceae. Native to southern Africa, it is characterized by its evergreen, strap-like leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, with clusters of flowers emerging from the leaf axils. Clivia species are adapted to shady, moist environments and are often cultivated as ornamental plants. They are also valued for their ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making them popular houseplants."
