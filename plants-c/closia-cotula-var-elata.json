It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has finely divided, serrated leaves that are aromatic when crushed. Due to its toxicity to livestock, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
