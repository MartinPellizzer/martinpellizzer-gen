    "intro": "Conocarpus acuminatus, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss and its ability to excrete excess salt through specialized glands. The plant has a shallow, fibrous root system that helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody, spherical fruits. Conocarpus acuminatus plays a vital role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine and terrestrial species."
