    "intro": "Centropogon augostanus, commonly known as the golden spike grass, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear pale yellow to golden flowers, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Centropogon augostanus is typically found in open grasslands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
