    "intro": "Crotonogyne lasiocarpa, commonly known as the silky-leaved croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with a soft, silky texture on the upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in warm climates for its unique foliage."
