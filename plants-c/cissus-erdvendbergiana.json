    "intro": "Cissus erdvendbergiana, commonly known as the rock fig or climbing fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Vitaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its trailing or climbing habit, with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically consumed by birds and small mammals. Cissus erdvendbergiana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to grow in challenging conditions."
