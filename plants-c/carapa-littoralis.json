    "intro": "Carapa littoralis, commonly known as the coastal carapa, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely on the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in mangrove or brackish water environments. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
