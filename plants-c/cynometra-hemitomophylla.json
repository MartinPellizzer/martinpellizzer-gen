    "intro": "Cynometra hemitomophylla, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The tree produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by round, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. Its wood is valued for its fine texture and durability, making it useful in furniture and construction. However, it is also considered a potential invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
