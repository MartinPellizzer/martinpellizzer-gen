    "intro": "Crepis segetalis, commonly known as the field mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with a distinctive basal rosette structure, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. Crepis segetalis is often found in agricultural fields, where it can become a weed but also plays a role in soil stabilization."
