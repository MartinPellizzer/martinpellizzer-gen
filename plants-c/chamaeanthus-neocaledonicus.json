    "intro": "Chamaeanthus neocaledonicus, commonly known as the New Caledonia heath, is a rare and unique plant native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
