    "intro": "Colchicum autumnale var. vernum, commonly known as the spring deathcap, is a toxic plant species native to Europe. It is characterized by its early blooming habit, with white to pale purple flowers appearing in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom before the leaves fully develop. It contains toxic alkaloids, particularly colchicine, which can be fatal if ingested. This variety is often confused with edible mushrooms, making it a significant hazard in natural environments."
