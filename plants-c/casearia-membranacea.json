    "intro": "Casearia membranacea, commonly known as the membranous casearia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, membranous layer, giving it its common name. It is often found in moist, forested areas and is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal uses."
