    "intro": "Cornus stolonifera var. behnschii, commonly known as the Behnschii dogwood, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by red or pink berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
