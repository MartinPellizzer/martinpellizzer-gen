    "intro": "Cymopterus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, demonstrating a high tolerance for salt and wind. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is part of the Onagraceae family, which includes other evening primroses and related plants."
