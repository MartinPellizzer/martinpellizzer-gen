    "intro": "Chloris ciliata var. brachyathera, commonly known as the short-haired grass or slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for ornamental use in gardens. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow, slightly hairy, and have a bluish-green hue, while its seed heads are slender and cylindrical. This variety is often used in native landscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to attract beneficial insects."
