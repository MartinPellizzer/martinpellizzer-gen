    "intro": "Calceolaria scabiosifolia var. cicutifolia, commonly known as the woolly slipper orchid, is a member of the Campanulaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Chile, and is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that resemble tiny cups. The plant has hairy, grayish-green foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in cooler climates and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant purple and pink flower colors, which bloom in spring."
