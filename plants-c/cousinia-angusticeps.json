    "intro": "Cousinia angusticeps, commonly known as narrowleaf globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the western United States. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. Cousinia angusticeps is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and its resilience to drought."
