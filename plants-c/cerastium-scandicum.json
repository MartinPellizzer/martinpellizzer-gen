    "intro": "Cerastium scandicum, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has hairy, opposite leaves that are heart-shaped and often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its creeping habit allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion."
