    "intro": "Capnoides rupestris, commonly known as the rock dodder, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on rocky substrates. It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant is characterized by its yellowish-green, thread-like stems and small, scale-like leaves. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem by relying on host plants for nutrients."
