    "intro": "Cymbopogon lividus, commonly known as the blue grass or blue wild rice, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features slender, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that often exhibit a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
