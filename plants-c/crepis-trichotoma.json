    "intro": "Crepis trichotoma, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Crepis trichotoma is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
