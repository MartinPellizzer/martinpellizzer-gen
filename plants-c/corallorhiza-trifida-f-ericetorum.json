    "intro": "Corallorhiza trifida f. ericetorum, commonly known as the Ericaceous Coralroot, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph. This plant relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. It typically grows in acidic, shaded environments such as heathlands and pine forests. The plant has a slender, branched stem with small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are pale pink to white, arranged in a loose spike, and are adapted for pollination by insects."
