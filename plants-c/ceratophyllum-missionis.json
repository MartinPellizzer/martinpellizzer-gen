    "intro": "Ceratophyllum missionis, commonly known as the mission watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to the southwestern United States. It has feathery, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that help it absorb nutrients from the water. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often found in shallow, slow-moving waters and can form dense underwater vegetation. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions, impacting local ecosystems."
