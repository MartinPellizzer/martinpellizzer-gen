    "intro": "Chrysosplenium zhangjiajieense, commonly known as Zhangjiajie stonecrop, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Zhangjiajie in China. It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and delicate, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject in botanical studies. Due to habitat loss and limited propagation, it is considered a vulnerable species."
