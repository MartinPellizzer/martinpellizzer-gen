    "intro": "Crepidium arachnoideum subsp. witkowskianum, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, spider-like appearance, with long, thin, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening only for a few days before withering. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
