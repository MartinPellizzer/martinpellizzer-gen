    "intro": "Coilantha glauca, commonly known as the blue-flowered coilantha, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue petals and compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Coilantha glauca thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Its foliage is typically covered in a fine, silvery-blue waxy coating, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss."
