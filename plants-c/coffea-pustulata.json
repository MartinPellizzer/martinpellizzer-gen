    "intro": "Coffea pustulata, commonly known as the pustulate coffee. It is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family, native to tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It produces red, fleshy berries that contain the seeds used for coffee production. However, it is less commercially significant compared to other Coffea species like C. arabica and C. canephora."
