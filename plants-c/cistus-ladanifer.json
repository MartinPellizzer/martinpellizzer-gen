    "intro": "Cistus ladanifer, commonly known as the sweet rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, resinous leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a distinctive essential oil, known as ladanum, which has been historically used in perfumery and traditional medicine. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
