    "intro": "Chromolaena horminoides, commonly known as the spreading chromolaena, is a shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in some areas."
