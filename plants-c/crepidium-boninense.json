    "intro": "Crepidium boninense, commonly known as the Bonin orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Bonin Islands. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a single, slender stem that bears a few showy, resupinate flowers with intricate markings. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the humid and shaded environments of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
