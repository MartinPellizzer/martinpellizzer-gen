It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, typically arranged in an alternate pattern along the stem. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are woody and can grow up to 10 meters in length, making it suitable for trellises or arbors. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
