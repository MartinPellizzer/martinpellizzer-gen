    "intro": "Cereus amecamensis, commonly known as the Mexican night bloomer, is a cacti species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure."
