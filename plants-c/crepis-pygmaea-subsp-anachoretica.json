    "intro": "Crepis pygmaea subsp. anachoretica, commonly known as the dwarf mouse-ear chickweed, is a small annual herb belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a single head. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its compact size and specific habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and locally distributed species."
