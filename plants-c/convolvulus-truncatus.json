    "intro": "Convolvulus truncatus, commonly known as the cut-leaved morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are often notched or truncate at the ends. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in the early morning. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common weed in agricultural fields and disturbed areas. The genus Convolvulus includes many species with similar morphological traits, but Convolvulus truncatus is distinguished by its unique leaf shape and flowering pattern."
