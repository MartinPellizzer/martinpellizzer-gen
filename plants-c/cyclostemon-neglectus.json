    "intro": "Cyclostemon neglectus, commonly known as the neglected cyclostemon, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small shrub characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often greenish-white in color, which are followed by small, round berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range. Botanically, it belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes a wide variety of flowering plants."
