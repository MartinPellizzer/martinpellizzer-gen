    "intro": "Cnidoscolus quercifolius, commonly known as the horse chestnut tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a large, deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, featuring broad, palmate leaves that resemble those of the horse chestnut. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by spherical, spiny fruits containing toxic seeds. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat. The plant is also noted for its potential use in traditional medicine, though its toxic compounds require caution in handling."
