    "intro": "Carex norvegica subsp. norvegica, commonly known as the Norway sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spikes of small, usually green or brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It has rhizomatous growth and can form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its leaves are usually narrow and sword-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface."
