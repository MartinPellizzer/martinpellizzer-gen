    "intro": "Corydalis bulbosa var. lineariloba, commonly known as the linear-leaved Corydalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-purple flowers with two lower petals that curve backward, a characteristic feature of the Corydalis genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to naturalize and spread slowly over time."
