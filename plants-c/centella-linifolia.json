    "intro": "Centella linifolia, commonly known as Asiatic pennywort, is a creeping perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny white flowers clustered in umbels. The plant is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, with runners that root at the nodes to form new plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Centella linifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
