It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit. The plant features small, hairy, oval-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers with five petals. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
