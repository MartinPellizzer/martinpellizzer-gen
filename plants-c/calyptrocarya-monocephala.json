    "intro": "Calyptrocarya monocephala, commonly known as the single-headed calyptrocarya, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive single terminal head, which is a modified stem that bears all its leaves and flowers. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, clustered at the top of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calyptrocarya monocephala is considered a rare and endangered species."
