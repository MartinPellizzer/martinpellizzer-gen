    "intro": "Calamagrostis lanceolata f. ramiflora, commonly known as the ramiflora reedgrass, is a compact, ornamental grass native to the eastern United States. It features narrow, dark green leaves that are slightly rolled at the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of pale to golden yellow flowers in late summer to early autumn. It is typically grown as a clump-forming plant, reaching heights of about 2 to 3 feet. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is well-suited for use in garden borders or as a specimen plant."
