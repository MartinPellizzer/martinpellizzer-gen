    "intro": "Caralluma subterranea, commonly known as the underground fig or desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom at night, and its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule containing seeds. It has adapted to extreme temperatures and low rainfall through its thick, waxy leaves and deep root system. Caralluma subterranea is also known for its traditional use in herbal medicine for its purported appetite-suppressing properties."
