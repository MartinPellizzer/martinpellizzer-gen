It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
