    "intro": "Chamaesyce remyi var. wilkesii, commonly known as Wilkes' sand mat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, fleshy, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces tiny, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or disturbed areas. Its succulent leaves help it store water, making it well adapted to arid or coastal environments."
