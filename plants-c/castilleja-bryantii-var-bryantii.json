    "intro": "Castilleja bryantii var. bryantii, commonly known as Bryant's paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients. The plant features showy, bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small and scale-like, and it typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The botanical structure of Bryant's paintbrush reflects its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments, with specialized root structures that facilitate parasitic relationships."
