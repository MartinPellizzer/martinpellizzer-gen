    "intro": "Condylocarpon hirtellum, commonly known as the hairy lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive botanical structure. It consists of a thallus that is typically greenish to yellowish in color, with a dense, hairy texture on its upper surface. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga, and a fungal component. It is often found growing on rock surfaces or tree trunks in moist, temperate environments. Its morphology and growth habits make it a notable species in ecological and taxonomic studies."
