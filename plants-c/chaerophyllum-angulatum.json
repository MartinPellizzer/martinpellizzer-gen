    "intro": "Chaerophyllum angulatum, commonly known as the angular cow-wheat, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small white or greenish flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse its seeds. The plant is often found in calcareous soils and is considered a valuable component of rich, moist habitats."
