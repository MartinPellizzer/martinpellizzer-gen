    "intro": "Columbaria vulgaris, commonly known as the common spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features erect, branching stems that are often covered in a milky, toxic sap. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a waxy texture with serrated edges. Columbaria vulgaris is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in waste areas."
