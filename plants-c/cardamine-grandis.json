The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in a raceme, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its roots are fibrous, and it is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant is known for its peppery, edible leaves, which have been used in traditional cuisines."
