    "intro": "Chamaemelum decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive chamomile, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers with white ray florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often used in traditional herbal remedies. However, it is sometimes mistaken for true chamomile due to its similar appearance, hence its common name."
