    "intro": "Cryptanthus acaulis var. bromelioides, commonly known as the \"Bromelioides carpet plant,\" is a compact, low-growing species native to South America. It features dense clusters of small, colorful flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often resembling a carpet of blooms. The plant has a rosette-shaped foliage structure with waxy, grass-like leaves that help retain moisture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, colorful ground covers."
