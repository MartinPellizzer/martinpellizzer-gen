It is closely related to the Prunus genus and is known for its showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, oval leaves that turn red in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes. Cerasus kanzakura is also valued for its edible fruits, though they are typically small and not widely consumed."
