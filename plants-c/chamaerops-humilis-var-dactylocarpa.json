    "intro": "Chamaerops humilis var. dactylocarpa, commonly known as the dwarf date palm, is a compact, fan-shaped palm native to the Mediterranean region. It features a slender trunk with a fibrous, reddish-brown bark and produces small, clustered inflorescences that yield edible, date-like fruits. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and container cultivation. Its ornamental value comes from its elegant foliage and adaptability to coastal climates. It is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
