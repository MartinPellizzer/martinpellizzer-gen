    "intro": "Cheilanthes chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean rock fern, is a perennial fern native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its compact, drought-tolerant growth habit and is often found in rocky or arid environments. The plant features glossy, dark green fronds with a leathery texture, and its rhizomes are thick and fibrous. It produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori. Cheilanthes chilensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
