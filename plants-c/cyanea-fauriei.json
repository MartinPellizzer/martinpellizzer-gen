    "intro": "Cyanea fauriei, commonly known as the Hawaiian sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly Hawaii. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub or small tree, with hairy, lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Cyanea fauriei thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to salt spray and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Its ornamental value has made it a popular plant in horticulture, though it is also recognized for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
