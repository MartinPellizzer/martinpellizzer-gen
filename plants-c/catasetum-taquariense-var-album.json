    "intro": "Catasetum taquariense var. album, commonly known as the white-flowered tiger orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its striking white petals and a unique, elongated lip that resembles a tiger's face, giving it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, nectar-rich flowers that attract specific pollinators, such as bees and wasps. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in botanical gardens and private collections."
