    "intro": "Carex dioica subsp. parallela, commonly known as the parallel sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of greenish or brownish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms."
