    "intro": "Cardwellia sublimis, commonly known as the mountain devil, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropics of northern Queensland, Australia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in rainforest or vine thickets, characterized by its dense, fibrous bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Cardwellia sublimis is adapted to high rainfall and humid conditions, often found on rocky or disturbed soils. Its unique appearance and habitat make it an important component of the region's biodiversity."
