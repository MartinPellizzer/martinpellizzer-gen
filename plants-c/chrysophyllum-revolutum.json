It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces smooth, yellow-orange fruits that are edible and have a sweet, buttery flavor. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and agroforestry systems."
