It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with triangular stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. Native to wetland environments, it thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces flowering spikes that can range in color from green to reddish-brown. Cyperus major plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by providing habitat for various insects and birds."
