    "intro": "Calanthe longgangensis, commonly known as the Longgang calanthe, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces showy, lanceolate leaves and bears fragrant, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive lip. It thrives in shaded, moist forest environments, typically at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
