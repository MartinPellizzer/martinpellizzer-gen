    "intro": "Carex stenocarpa, commonly known as narrow-cup sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, three-angled berries. Carex stenocarpa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
