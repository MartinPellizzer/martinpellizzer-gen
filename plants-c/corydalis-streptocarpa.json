    "intro": "Corydalis streptocarpa, commonly known as the purple corydalis, is a flowering plant native to regions of Asia, including China and Japan. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, nodding flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in woodland or shady areas and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its tubular flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Corydalis streptocarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a ground cover."
