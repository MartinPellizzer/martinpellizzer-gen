    "intro": "Cyathea manniana var. preussii, commonly known as the Preuss's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, while the root system is fibrous and helps anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments. This species is often found in tropical rainforests where it thrives in humid and nutrient-rich soil."
