    "intro": "Coreopsis beguinotii, commonly known as the Mexican tickseed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners in arid and semi-arid regions. Coreopsis beguinotii is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
