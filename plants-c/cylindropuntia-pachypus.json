    "intro": "Cylindropuntia pachypus, commonly known as the flat-topped cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems that are typically green and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by bright red fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a deep root system that allows it to survive in arid environments. This cactus is well adapted to desert conditions and is often found in rocky soils."
