    "intro": "Cheynia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Amaryllis family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its harsh environment. Cheynia typically blooms during the rainy season, producing showy flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its resilience and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in dry climates."
