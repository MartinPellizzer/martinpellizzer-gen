    "intro": "Cassia atroglandulosa, commonly known as the black glanded cassia, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, glandular structures along the leaf veins. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical spikes, which are typical of the legume family. Its seeds are encased in elongated pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Cassia atroglandulosa is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes due to its rich chemical composition."
