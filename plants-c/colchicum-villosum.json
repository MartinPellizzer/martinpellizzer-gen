It is characterized by its hairy, grass-like leaves and striking purple or pink flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces distinctive, helmet-shaped corms that store nutrients for the next growing season. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in gardens and studied for its bioactive compounds."
