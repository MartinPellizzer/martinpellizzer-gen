    "intro": "Calandrinia glomerata, commonly known as the clustered portulaca, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a low-growing herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white powder. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions."
