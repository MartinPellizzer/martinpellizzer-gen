    "intro": "Cytisogenista malacitana, commonly known as the Malacitan broom, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, arranged in racemes, and it produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
