    "intro": "Coffea obscura, commonly known as the dark coffee plant, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries containing the seeds used for coffee. It thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Coffea obscura is considered a lesser-known but ecologically significant species."
