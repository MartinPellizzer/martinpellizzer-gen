    "intro": "Cryptocarya membranacea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tallowwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels and avocados, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy white flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. Cryptocarya membranacea is often found in rainforest and coastal scrub habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
