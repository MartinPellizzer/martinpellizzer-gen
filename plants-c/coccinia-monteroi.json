    "intro": "Coccinia monteroi, commonly known as the mountain cucumber, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and melons. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its fruit is a small, edible berry that turns from green to orange as it matures. The leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
