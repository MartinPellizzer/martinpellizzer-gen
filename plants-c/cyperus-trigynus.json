It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, three-lobed spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stems. Cyperus trigynus is often found in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
