    "intro": "Crossostylis biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered crossostylis, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, branched stems and finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
