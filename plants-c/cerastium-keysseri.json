    "intro": "Cerastium keysseri, commonly known as the Keyser's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate floral display to rocky or alpine habitats. Cerastium keysseri thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in ecological and horticultural contexts."
