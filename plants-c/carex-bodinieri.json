    "intro": "Carex bodinieri, commonly known as the golden club, is a perennial sedge native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms compact clumps, with narrow, bright yellow to golden-green leaves. The plant produces spikes of small, greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by cylindrical, spike-like fruits. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Carex bodinieri is a hardy plant that is well-suited for wetland restoration and ornamental gardening in water-retentive environments."
