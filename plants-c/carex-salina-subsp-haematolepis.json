    "intro": "Carex salina subsp. haematolepis, commonly known as salt marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is typically found in brackish or saline wetlands. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, clustered flowers in early summer, which are usually green or brown in color. This subspecies is adapted to tolerate high salinity and is an important component of coastal ecosystems."
