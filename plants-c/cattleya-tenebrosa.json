It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and striking dark purple to black flowers with yellow lips. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a dramatic visual contrast to its foliage.
