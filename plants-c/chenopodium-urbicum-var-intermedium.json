    "intro": "Chenopodium urbicum var. intermedium, commonly known as lamb's quarters, is a versatile annual plant characterized by its alternate, broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by dry, three-angled seed capsules. The plant is native to temperate regions and thrives in disturbed soils, often found in urban and agricultural settings. It is known for its high nutritional value, containing significant amounts of vitamins and minerals. However, it can also be considered a weed in cultivated fields due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
