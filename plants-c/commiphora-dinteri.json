    "intro": "Commiphora dinteri, commonly known as the Dinter's myrrh, is a rare and endangered plant native to the arid regions of Namibia and southwestern Angola. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh-producing species. The plant is characterized by its gnarled, twisted trunk and small, dark green leaves. It produces a resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and incense. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
