    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 macrochilum, commonly known as the large-lobed lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of China and Korea. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollination trap. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, upright stem with a few leaves. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
