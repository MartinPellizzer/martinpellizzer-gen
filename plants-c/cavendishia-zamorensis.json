    "intro": "Cavendishia zamorensis, commonly known as the Zamora's Cavendish, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence that can range from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture. Cavendishia zamorensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
