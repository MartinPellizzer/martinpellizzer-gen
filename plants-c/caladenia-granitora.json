    "intro": "Caladenia granitora, commonly known as the granitic spider-orchid, is an endemic species found in the south-western region of Western Australia. It is a terrestrial herb with a single, slender, leaf and a single, elongated flower spike. The flower is typically pink to pale purple with a distinctive, narrow, wing-like structure at the base. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and shrublands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
