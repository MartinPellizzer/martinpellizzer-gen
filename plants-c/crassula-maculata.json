It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often variegated with green and pink or white markings. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and bonsai cultivation."
