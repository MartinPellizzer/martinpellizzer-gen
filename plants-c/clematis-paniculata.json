    "intro": "Clematis paniculata, commonly known as the panicled clematis, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets and produces fragrant, white to pale blue flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its long, climbing stems can reach lengths of up to 15 feet, making it a popular choice for trellises and arches. Clematis paniculata is relatively low maintenance but benefits from regular pruning to encourage vigorous growth and flowering."
