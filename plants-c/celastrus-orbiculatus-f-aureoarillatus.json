    "intro": "Celastrus orbiculatus f. aureoarillatus, commonly known as the golden aril honeysuckle, is a variant of the common Chinese lantern plant. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow arils that encase the seeds, which are highly visible and attractive. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that mature in late summer. It is native to East Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
