    "intro": "Cyclocotyla, commonly known as the spiral-shaped sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian belonging to the family Hexacorallia. It is characterized by its unique, coiled polyp structure that allows it to anchor itself to substrates in shallow coastal waters. The organism exhibits asexual reproduction through budding, which contributes to its population growth in suitable environments. Cyclocotyla has a simple body plan with a gastrovascular cavity and tentacles used for capturing prey. Its ecological role includes serving as a food source for various marine species and contributing to the biodiversity of reef ecosystems."
