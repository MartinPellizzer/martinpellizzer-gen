    "intro": "Carduus hamulosus var. sordidus, commonly known as the sordid thistle, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in arid conditions. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields."
