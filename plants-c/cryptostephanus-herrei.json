    "intro": "Cryptostephanus herrei, commonly known as the Hawaiian stephanurus, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its flowering period occurs during the wet season, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
