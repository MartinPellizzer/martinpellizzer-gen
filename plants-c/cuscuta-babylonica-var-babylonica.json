    "intro": "Cuscuta babylonica var. babylonica, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, thread-like branches. The plant is native to various regions across Asia and is often found growing on crops such as wheat and barley. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas easily. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the yield of agricultural crops."
