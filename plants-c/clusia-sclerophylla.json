    "intro": "Clusia sclerophylla, commonly known as the waxleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking visual appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and resilience. Clusia sclerophylla is also valued for its ability to tolerate shade and its use in traditional medicine in certain regions."
