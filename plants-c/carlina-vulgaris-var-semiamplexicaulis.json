    "intro": "Carlina vulgaris var. semiamplexicaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cudweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are slightly clasping around the stem, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite inflorescences, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its foliage and flowers are used in traditional herbal medicine for their mild astringent properties."
