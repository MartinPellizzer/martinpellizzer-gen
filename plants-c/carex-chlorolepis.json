    "intro": "Carex chlorolepis, commonly known as the green-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are usually clustered in spikelets, and it produces distinctive, three-sided fruits. Carex chlorolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
