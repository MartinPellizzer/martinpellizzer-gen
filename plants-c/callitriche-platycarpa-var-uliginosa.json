    "intro": "Callitriche platycarpa var. uliginosa, commonly known as swamp waterstar, is a small aquatic herb native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, often in muddy or silted areas. The plant has small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, and its leaves are opposite, floating or submerged depending on the water conditions. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, wet soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. This variety is notable for its adaptability to fluctuating water levels and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
