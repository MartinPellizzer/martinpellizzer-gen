    "intro": "Calophanes humistratus, commonly known as the swamp mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, exhibiting a sprawling growth habit with fleshy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its roots are adapted to waterlogged conditions, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments. Calophanes humistratus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
