    "intro": "Combretum laxum, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in summer, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Combretum laxum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to withstand drought."
