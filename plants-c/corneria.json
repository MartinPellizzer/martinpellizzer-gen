    "intro": "Corneria, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its harsh environment. Its bulbous root system allows it to survive droughts by drawing moisture from deep underground. Corneria is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
