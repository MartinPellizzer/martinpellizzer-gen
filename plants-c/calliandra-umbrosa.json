    "intro": "Calliandra umbrosa, commonly known as the dark calliandra, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery inflorescences that range in color from pale yellow to deep red. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in agroforestry systems."
