    "intro": "Chamaecrista belemii var. paludicola, commonly known as the swamp crownflower, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in South America. It features slender, erect stems that often grow up to 1 meter in height, and its leaves are pinnately compound with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
