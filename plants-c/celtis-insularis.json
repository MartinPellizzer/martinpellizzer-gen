    "intro": "Celtis insularis, commonly known as the Bahama cherry, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Cannabaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that give way to bright red, fleshy berries. These berries are an important food source for various birds and mammals in its native habitat. Celtis insularis is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and well-drained soils."
