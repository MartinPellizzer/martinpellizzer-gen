    "intro": "Chaenomeles speciosa, commonly known as the Japanese flowering quince, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces bright red or orange berries in the fall, which are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant blossoms and attractive foliage. Chaenomeles speciosa prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
