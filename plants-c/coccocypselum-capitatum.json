    "intro": "Coccocypselum capitatum, commonly known as the golden crownbeard, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are arranged in a dense, spherical cluster, giving it its common name. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
