    "intro": "Callitriche \u00d7 vigens, commonly known as the hybrid water starwort, is a semi-aquatic plant that thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. It is a member of the Haloragaceae family and exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Callitriche spp. and *Vignea* (though the latter is not a recognized genus in modern taxonomy, suggesting a possible taxonomic confusion). The plant typically has small, floating or submerged leaves that are oval to ovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. It produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late summer to early autumn."
