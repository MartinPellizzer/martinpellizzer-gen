    "intro": "Circaeaster agrestis, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open grasslands. Circaeaster agrestis is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in harsh coastal environments."
