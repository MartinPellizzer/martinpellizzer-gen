    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris var. dentata, commonly known as the toothed common chickweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its small, white or pink flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. The variety dentata is distinguished by its serrated or toothed leaf margins, which set it apart from the typical form of C. bursa-pastoris. It is a low-growing annual plant that often thrives in disturbed soils and open areas. This species is commonly found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides, where it spreads easily through its seeds."
