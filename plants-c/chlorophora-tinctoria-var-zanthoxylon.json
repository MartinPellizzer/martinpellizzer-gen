    "intro": "Chlorophora tinctoria var. zanthoxylon, commonly known as the yellow-heart wood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its dense, golden-yellow heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has large, palmate leaves and produces small, greenish flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its botanical significance lies in its unique wood properties and its role in traditional craftsmanship and local economies. However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
