    "intro": "Cathartolinum sardoum, commonly known as the Sardinian cathartic plant, is a rare species native to the Mediterranean island of Sardinia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant possesses a unique ability to produce cathartic compounds, which have historically been used in traditional medicine for their purgative effects. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white wax, aiding in water retention in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, Cathartolinum sardoum is considered a vulnerable species."
