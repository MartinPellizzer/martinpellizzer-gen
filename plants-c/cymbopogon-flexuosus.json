    "intro": "Cymbopogon flexuosus, commonly known as lemon grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its aromatic, lemon-scented leaves that contain high concentrations of citral, a compound responsible for its distinctive fragrance. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. Its rhizomes and roots are also utilized in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Cymbopogon flexuosus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its essential oils and culinary uses."
