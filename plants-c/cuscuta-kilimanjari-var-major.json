    "intro": "Cuscuta kilimanjari var. major, commonly known as the giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched stem covered in tiny, adhesive structures that allow it to attach to host plants. The plant is native to Africa and is often found growing on trees and shrubs in tropical and subtropical regions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through fragmentation of the plant. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and native vegetation."
