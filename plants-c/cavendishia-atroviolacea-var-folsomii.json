It is characterized by its distinctive dark violet to black spines and a compact, branching growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its dark foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for succulent gardens and rockeries."
