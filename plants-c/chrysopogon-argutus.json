It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. It is often found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Chrysopogon argutus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements."
