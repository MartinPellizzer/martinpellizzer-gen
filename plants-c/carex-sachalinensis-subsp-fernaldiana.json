It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats."
