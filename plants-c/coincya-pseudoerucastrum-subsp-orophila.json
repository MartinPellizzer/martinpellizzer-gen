    "intro": "Coincya pseudoerucastrum subsp. orophila, commonly known as the mountain waterwheel plant, is a rare aquatic plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of broad, elliptical leaves. It is native to high-altitude regions of South America, where it thrives in cool, clear streams and ponds. The plant's leaves are typically green to reddish in color, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind, and its rhizomes form dense colonies in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
