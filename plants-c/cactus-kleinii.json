    "intro": "Cactus kleinii, commonly known as the Klein's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a globular shape and a thick, fleshy stem that stores water. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its thick, waxy cuticle helps reduce water loss, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Cactus kleinii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
