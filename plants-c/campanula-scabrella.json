    "intro": "Campanula scabrella, commonly known as the rough bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves, which give it a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or mountainous regions. Campanula scabrella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
