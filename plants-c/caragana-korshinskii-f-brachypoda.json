It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, compound leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by pea-like pods containing several seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for erosion control. Its botanical features make it an important plant in both ecological restoration and ornamental horticulture."
