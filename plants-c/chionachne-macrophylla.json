    "intro": "Chionachne macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf snowgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as tundra and wet meadows. The plant has basal leaves that are broad and often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a frosty appearance. Its small, white to pale pink flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom in late spring to early summer. Chionachne macrophylla plays an important ecological role in its environment by providing food for herbivores and stabilizing soil in fragile ecosystems."
