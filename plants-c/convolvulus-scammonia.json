    "intro": "Convolvulus scammonia, commonly known as bladder campion, is a flowering plant belonging to the bindweed family (Convolvulaceae). It is a low-growing herbaceous plant with opposite, ovate leaves and produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and it often grows in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields. Its seeds are enclosed in a bladder-like structure, which aids in their dispersal by wind. Convolvulus scammonia is known for its medicinal uses in traditional herbal remedies."
