    "intro": "Cinnadenia liyuyingii, commonly known as the Liyuying's cinnadenia, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Cinnamomaceae family. It is native to specific regions in China, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. Its botanical features include lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin and a woody stem that exudes a fragrant resin. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
