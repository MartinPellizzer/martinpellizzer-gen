    "intro": "Cotoneaster hebephyllus var. monopyrenus, commonly known as the dwarf cotoneaster, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to China. It features small, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a border plant due to its low maintenance and ornamental value. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for horticultural use in temperate climates."
