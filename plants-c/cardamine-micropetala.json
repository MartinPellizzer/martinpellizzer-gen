    "intro": "Cardamine micropetala, commonly known as lesser water shield, is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant has delicate, kidney-shaped leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss in its wet habitat. Cardamine micropetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
