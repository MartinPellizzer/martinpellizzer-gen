    "intro": "Cardamine angustata f. parviflora, commonly known as the narrowleaf watercress, is a fern-like herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a raceme, typically blooming in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in wet soils. Due to its preference for cool, damp conditions, it is often found in stream banks, marshes, and woodland floors."
