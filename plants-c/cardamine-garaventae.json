    "intro": "Cardamine garaventae, commonly known as the Garaventa watercress, is a rare and delicate member of the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, fern-like leaves that are typically submerged or partially submerged in moist environments. The plant produces tiny white flowers with four petals, typical of the mustard family. It is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in mountainous areas with cool, humid climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species."
