    "intro": "Cyathea grayumii, commonly known as the Gray's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant has a robust rhizome system that supports its tall stature and enables it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, making it a striking feature in both natural and cultivated settings. Cyathea grayumii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to add a tropical aesthetic to gardens."
