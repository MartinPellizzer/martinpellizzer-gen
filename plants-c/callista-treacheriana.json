    "intro": "Callista treacheriana, commonly known as the treacherous callista, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a smooth texture, while its stems are woody and somewhat branched. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate species with limited cultivation outside its native range."
