    "intro": "Campylocera leptocarpa var. glabella, commonly known as the smooth-leaved sandverbena, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for pollinators and a subject of study in arid ecosystems."
