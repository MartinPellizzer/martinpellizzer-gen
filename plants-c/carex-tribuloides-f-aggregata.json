    "intro": "Carex tribuloides f. aggregata, commonly known as the clustered sedge, is a clump-forming perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-green hue, while the flowering stems rise above the foliage. This ornamental sedge is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife in wetland environments."
