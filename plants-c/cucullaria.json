These plants are characterized by their distinctive flowers, which often resemble small bells or hoods, hence their common name. They typically have hairy stems and alternate leaves that are often lance-shaped or ovate. Cucullaria species are native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America, and they thrive in well-drained soils. The flowers are usually blue, purple, or white, and they attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
