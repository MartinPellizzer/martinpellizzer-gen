    "intro": "Campella, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves, often with a distinctive reddish hue. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with a pea-like structure typical of the legume family. Campella species are native to various regions in Africa and are valued for their hard, durable wood. However, due to overharvesting, many species are now threatened with extinction."
