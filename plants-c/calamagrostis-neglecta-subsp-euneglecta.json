    "intro": "Calamagrostis neglecta subsp. euneglecta, commonly known as the slender false panicgrass, is a grass species native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity."
