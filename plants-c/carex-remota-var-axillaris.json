It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It has narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy, and its flowers are small and clustered. This variety is distinguished by its slender stems and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
