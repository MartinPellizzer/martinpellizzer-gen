    "intro": "Cryptostylis ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-lipped spider-orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to eastern Australia. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with a single, narrow leaf and a short, hairy stem. The plant produces a single, elongated flower spike bearing a single, strikingly colored flower with a narrow lip. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with reddish-brown markings, and they bloom during late spring to early summer. Cryptostylis ligulata is adapted to grow on trees or rocks, relying on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment."
