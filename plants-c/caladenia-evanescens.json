    "intro": "Caladenia evanescens, commonly known as the fading caladenia, is a species of orchid native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, strikingly colored flower that often displays a mix of red, yellow, and orange hues. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as woodlands and heaths. It is a terrestrial orchid with a short flowering period, usually during spring. The species is notable for its ephemeral bloom, which fades quickly, giving it its common name."
