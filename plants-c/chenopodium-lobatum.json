It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture and prominent veins. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, followed by dry, triangular seed capsules. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Chenopodium lobatum is a common weed but also has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a food source."
