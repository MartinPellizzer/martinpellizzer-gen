    "intro": "Chrysopogon nutans var. avenaceus, commonly known as the slender false grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open grasslands and disturbed soils, exhibiting a low-growing, clump-forming habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its fibrous roots and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and soil-stabilizing properties."
