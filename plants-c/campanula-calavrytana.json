    "intro": "Campanula calavrytana, commonly known as the Cyprus bellflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Cyprus. It is characterized by its bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in well-drained environments. It has narrow, hairy leaves and a compact growth habit, making it well adapted to its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
