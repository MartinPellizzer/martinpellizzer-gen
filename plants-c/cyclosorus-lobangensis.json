    "intro": "Cyclosorus lobangensis, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Oleandraceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, floating fronds that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, and is native to Southeast Asia. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically found on the underside of the fronds. Cyclosorus lobangensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms."
