    "intro": "Campsiandra gomez-alvareziana var. pusilliflora, commonly known as the dwarf campsiandra, is a rare and understudied plant species native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed-like plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth surface, and the plant exhibits a compact growth habit. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
