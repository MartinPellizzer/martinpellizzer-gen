    "intro": "Cerastium varians subsp. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rock gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ground cover in horticulture."
