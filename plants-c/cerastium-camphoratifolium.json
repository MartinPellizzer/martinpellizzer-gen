    "intro": "Cerastium camphoratifolium, commonly known as camphorleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves that emit a faint camphor-like scent, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early summer, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its compact growth habit and aromatic foliage make it a unique addition to native plant gardens."
