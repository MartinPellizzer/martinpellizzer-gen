    "intro": "Cyperus dioicus, commonly known as the zigzag sedge, is a flowering plant species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically with separate male and female flowers on different stems, a feature known as dioecy. Cyperus dioicus thrives in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems. Its adaptability to moist environments makes it an important component of wetland flora."
