    "intro": "Coccoloba acrostichoides, commonly known as the broadleaf hibiscus, is a species of flowering plant in the Malvaceae family. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming from spring to summer. The plant is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking appearance and adaptability to various soil types."
