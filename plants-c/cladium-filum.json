    "intro": "Cladium filum, commonly known as the slender sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland ecosystems in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and swamps. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often ribbed and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowering stems produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. Cladium filum plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
