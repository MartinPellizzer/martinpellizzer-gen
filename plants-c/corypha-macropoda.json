    "intro": "Corypha macropoda, commonly known as the giant palm, is a large, flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces inflorescences that are complex and often covered in spines, which protect the developing flowers. Corypha macropoda is a dioecious species, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
