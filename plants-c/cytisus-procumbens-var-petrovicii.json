    "intro": "Cytisus procumbens var. petrovicii, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. This variety is adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy plant in Mediterranean climates."
