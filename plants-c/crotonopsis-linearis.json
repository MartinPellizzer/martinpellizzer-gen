    "intro": "Crotonopsis linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf croton, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often strikingly ornamental species. The plant features narrow, elongated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in cyathia, a characteristic structure common in the Euphorbiaceae family. Crotonopsis linearis is often cultivated for its unique foliage rather than its flowers."
