    "intro": "Chrysophyllum papuanicum, commonly known as the Papuan cherimoya, is a tropical evergreen tree native to New Guinea. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, creamy fruits with a sweet, aromatic pulp. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruit, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and horticultural collections."
