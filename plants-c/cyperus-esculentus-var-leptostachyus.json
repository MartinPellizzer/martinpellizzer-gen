It thrives in shallow freshwater environments, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of rivers. The plant has a bulbous, edible tuber that is harvested for its crunchy, nutty flavor. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown. It is valued both for its culinary use and its ability to stabilize aquatic ecosystems."
