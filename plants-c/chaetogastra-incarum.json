It is characterized by its dense, spiny bracts that form a spherical shape, giving it a pincushion-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
