    "intro": "Calanthe tsiana, commonly known as the Tsiana calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in partial shade. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the rich, organic soil of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calanthe tsiana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
