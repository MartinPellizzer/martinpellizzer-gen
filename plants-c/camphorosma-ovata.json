    "intro": "Camphorosma ovata, commonly known as the narrowleaf camphor tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous small, dark seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Camphorosma ovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry landscapes."
