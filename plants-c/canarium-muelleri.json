    "intro": "Canarium muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's candlenut, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its latex is used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil, while the wood is valued for its durability and fine grain. Canarium muelleri thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests."
