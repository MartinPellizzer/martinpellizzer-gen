    "intro": "Convolvulus sarmentosus, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the bindweed family (Convolvulaceae). It is a perennial herb that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in the early morning. Its stems are sprawling and can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively. The leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
