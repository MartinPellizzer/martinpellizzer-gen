    "intro": "Celastrus cymosus, commonly known as the creeping staffvetch, is a climbing shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It features woody stems that can grow along the ground or ascend other vegetation. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cymes, followed by elliptical, orange-red berries. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating. Celastrus cymosus is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
