    "intro": "Cousinia affinis var. talassica, commonly known as the Talassic cushion plant, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is well adapted to cold, dry climates. Due to its ornamental appeal and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
