It features a compact, bushy growth habit with numerous clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, and its stems are covered in fine, hairy hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
