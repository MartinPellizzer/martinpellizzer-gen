    "intro": "Chamaesyce multiformis, commonly known as the variable sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on sandy or disturbed soils. The plant features small, green leaves that are often hairy and arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. Its flowers are inconspicuous, with five narrow sepals and no petals, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
