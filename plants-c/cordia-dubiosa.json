    "intro": "Cordia dubiosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often dotted with small glands. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in sandy or well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, Cordia dubiosa is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic and practical attributes."
