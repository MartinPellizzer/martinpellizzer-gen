    "intro": "Colymbada guicciardii, commonly known as the Guicciardini's colymbada, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers are small and yellow, often forming a flat-topped cluster, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
