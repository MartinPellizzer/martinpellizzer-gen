It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a smooth texture. Clethra arborea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
