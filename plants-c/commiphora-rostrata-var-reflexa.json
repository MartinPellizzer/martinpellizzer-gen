    "intro": "Commiphora rostrata var. reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed myrrh tree, is a rare and ancient plant native to the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, reflexed leaf margins and aromatic resinous sap. The plant produces a gum resin that has been historically used in traditional medicine and incense. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
