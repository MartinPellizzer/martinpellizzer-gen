    "intro": "Cryptosepalum curtisiorum, commonly known as the narrow-sepal orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and possesses distinctive floral structures with narrow, elongated sepals. The plant typically blooms during the late summer months, producing delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. It thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
