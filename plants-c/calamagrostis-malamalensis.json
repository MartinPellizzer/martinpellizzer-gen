    "intro": "Calamagrostis malamalensis, commonly known as the Malamalama grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
