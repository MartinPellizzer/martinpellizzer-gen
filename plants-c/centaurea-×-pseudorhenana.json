    "intro": "Centaurea \u00d7 pseudorhenana, commonly known as the hybrid cornflower, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Centaurea cyanus (blue cornflower) and Centaurea solstitialis (yellow star-thistle). The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is found in regions of western North America. It has blue to purple flowers and is characterized by its robust, branching stems. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a noxious weed in certain areas."
