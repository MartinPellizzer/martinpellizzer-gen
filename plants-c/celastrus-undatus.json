    "intro": "Celastrus undatus, commonly known as the waxy beggar-tick, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous vine that typically grows along the ground or climbing structures, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with wavy margins. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that attract birds. Its roots contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, though it is toxic if ingested. Celastrus undatus thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests."
