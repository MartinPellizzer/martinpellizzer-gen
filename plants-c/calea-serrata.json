    "intro": "Calea serrata, commonly known as the \"Mexican nightshade,\" is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has serrated leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported sedative and anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. Calea serrata is also noted for its aromatic foliage, which contributes to its presence in both ornamental and medicinal horticulture."
