It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are typically succulent and fleshy. Chenopodium scoparia is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
