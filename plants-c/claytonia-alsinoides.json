    "intro": "Claytonia alsinoides, commonly known as the \"pea greens\" or \"mock strawberry,\" is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white, powdery coating called farina. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its succulent leaves are edible and have a peppery, slightly nutty flavor. Claytonia alsinoides thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
