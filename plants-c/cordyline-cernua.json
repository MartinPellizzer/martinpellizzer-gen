    "intro": "Cordyline cernua, commonly known as the silver cordyline, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, silver-blue leaves that are often lined with white or gray veins. The plant produces striking red or purple bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and indoor cultivation. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to retain its foliage year-round in suitable climates."
