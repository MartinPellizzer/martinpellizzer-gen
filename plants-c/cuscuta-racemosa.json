    "intro": "Cuscuta racemosa, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a raceme, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity. The plant has a twining stem that adheres to its host through specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is found in various habitats across North America, often growing on crops like corn and soybeans. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural plants."
