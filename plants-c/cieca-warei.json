    "intro": "Cieca warei, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and clusters of pale green or white flowers. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its humid, shaded environment. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Cieca warei is considered a conservation concern."
