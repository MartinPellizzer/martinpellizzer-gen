    "intro": "Cochemiea viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered cactus, is a species native to the desert regions of Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features a compact, globular shape with a greenish-gray stem covered in fine, white hairs. Its most distinctive feature is its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring. Cochemiea viridiflora is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and relying on minimal rainfall for survival."
