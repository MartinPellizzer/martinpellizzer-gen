    "intro": "Crocus croceus, commonly known as the common crocus, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas. The plant features a short, stout rhizome and produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge, and are surrounded by a protective, scaly leaf-like structure called a tunic. Crocus croceus is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a source of saffron-like pigments."
