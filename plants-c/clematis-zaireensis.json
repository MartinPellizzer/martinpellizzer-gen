It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets, and its flowers are typically large, showy, and fragrant. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires support for its long, twining stems. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in subtropical areas."
