    "intro": "Cereus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the cactus family, Cactaceae. These plants are native to the Americas, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. They are characterized by their spiny stems and ability to store water, which helps them survive in harsh environments. Many species of Cereus produce large, showy flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. The genus includes over 160 species, some of which are popular as ornamental plants due to their striking appearance."
