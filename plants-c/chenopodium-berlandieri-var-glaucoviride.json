It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species characterized by its rough, spiny leaves and small greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in dry, open areas. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is part of the Amaranthaceae family and is known for its adaptability to various soil types."
