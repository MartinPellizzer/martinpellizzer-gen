    "intro": "Curculigo stans, commonly known as the creeping arrowroot, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in white or pale yellow, and are often borne on short pedicels. Curculigo stans is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
