    "intro": "Casinga, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of grasses. Casinga thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
