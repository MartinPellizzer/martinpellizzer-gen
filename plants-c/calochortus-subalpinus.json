    "intro": "Calochortus subalpinus, commonly known as the alpine mariposa lily, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, often in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environments it inhabits. Calochortus subalpinus plays an important ecological role in its ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its native range."
