    "intro": "Centropogon urubambae var. estrellanus, commonly known as the Estrellan mountain grass, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it adapts to cool and arid conditions. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, producing delicate white or pale blue flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant species for ecological studies in mountainous ecosystems."
