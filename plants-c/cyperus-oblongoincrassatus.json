    "intro": "Cyperus oblongoincrassatus, commonly known as the broad-leaved flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like stems and broad, flat leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Cyperus oblongoincrassatus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats."
