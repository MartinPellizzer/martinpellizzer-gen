    "intro": "Crepidium rhabdophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil. Crepidium rhabdophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
