    "intro": "Celastrus patentiflorus, commonly known as the spreading-flowered staff-vine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous vine that typically grows along forest edges and in moist, shaded areas. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its showy, yellow-orange flowers appear in clusters during the spring and are followed by small, fleshy berries. The berries are edible for some animals but are generally considered toxic to humans."
