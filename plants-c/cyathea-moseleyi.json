    "intro": "Cyathea moseleyi, commonly known as the Moseley's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a distinctive crown of pinnate leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea moseleyi typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its slow growth rate and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation."
