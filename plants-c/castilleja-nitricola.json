    "intro": "Castilleja nitricola, commonly known as the nitrate Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for nutrients, often growing on the roots of grasses or shrubs. Its structure consists of a reddish stem with dense clusters of showy bracts that resemble paintbrushes. Castilleja nitricola plays a role in supporting pollinators and is often found in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe."
