    "intro": "Cynodon monostachyus, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for landscaping and erosion control. Its ability to form dense mats makes it a valuable plant in arid and semi-arid regions."
