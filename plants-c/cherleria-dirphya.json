    "intro": "Cherleria dirphya, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, silver-green foliage and clusters of fragrant, white to pale purple flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Cherleria dirphya is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
