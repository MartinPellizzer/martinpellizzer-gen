It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Canthium urophyllum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade."
