    "intro": "Caladenia hildae, commonly known as the Hildae Spider-orchid, is an endemic species of orchid found in Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, intricately patterned orchid flower that resembles a spider. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, producing a strikingly colored flower with a dark, veined labellum. Caladenia hildae is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in sandy soils and is often found in open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
