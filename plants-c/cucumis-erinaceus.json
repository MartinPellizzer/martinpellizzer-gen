    "intro": "Cucumis erinaceus, commonly known as the horned cucumber, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It produces elongated, spiky fruits that are covered in small, pointed tubercles, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and requires support for its vining growth habit. The fruit is edible, though its texture is fibrous and it is often used in salads or pickled."
