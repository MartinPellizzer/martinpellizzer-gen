    "intro": "Crotalaria mesopontica var. congolensis, commonly known as the Congo crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant features palmate leaves with three to five leaflets and produces yellow or orange flowers in racemose inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, inflated pod, and the plant often grows in disturbed soils or along forest edges. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical uses remain under study."
