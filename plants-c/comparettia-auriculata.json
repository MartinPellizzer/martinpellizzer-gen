It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and striking, fragrant flowers that resemble small orchids. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often in shades of yellow and orange, and are known for their unique auriculate (ear-shaped) petals. Comparettia auriculata prefers warm temperatures and high humidity, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
