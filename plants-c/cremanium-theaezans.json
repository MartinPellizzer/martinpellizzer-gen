    "intro": "Cremanium theaezans, commonly known as the Chinese crepe fern, is a unique member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble crepe paper, giving it its common name. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are bi-directionally pinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal. It is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic qualities and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soil."
