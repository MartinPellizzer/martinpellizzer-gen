    "intro": "Costus spicatus, commonly known as the spiky costus, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes ginger and turmeric, and is characterized by its aromatic, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its most distinctive feature is its clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in summer and are arranged in spike-like inflorescences. Costus spicatus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking appearance and ability to thrive in warm, humid environments."
