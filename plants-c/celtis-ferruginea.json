    "intro": "Celtis ferruginea, commonly known as the red-osier elm, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark that often develops reddish streaks as it ages. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, typically turning yellow in the fall. Celtis ferruginea is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to a variety of environmental conditions."
