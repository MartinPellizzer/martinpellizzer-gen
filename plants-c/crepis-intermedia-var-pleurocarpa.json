    "intro": "Crepis intermedia var. pleurocarpa, commonly known as the pleurocarp crested hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically arranged in a single head, and it has finely divided, grass-like leaves. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
