    "intro": "Castilleja coronopifolia, commonly known as the Sierra redshank, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots from host plants such as grasses and shrubs. Its structure consists of a slender stem with whorled clusters of flowers, and it typically grows in dry, open habitats. Castilleja coronopifolia plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar to pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
