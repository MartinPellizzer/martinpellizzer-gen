It produces round, green to yellow-orange fruits that are typically inedible due to their high acidity and bitter taste. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of essential oils. Its botanical features include a branched structure, thorn-like protrusions, and a strong, distinctive scent. This subsp. is often used in perfumery and traditional medicine."
