    "intro": "Carex bonariensis f. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf marsh sedge, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or moist soil environments, thriving in partial to full shade. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, and it is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive, low-maintenance appearance. The varietal form 'pumila' is distinguished by its shorter stature compared to the typical Carex bonariensis."
