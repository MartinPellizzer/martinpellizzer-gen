    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis var. platychlaena, commonly known as the broad-leaf brittle fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to various regions in Asia, including China and Japan. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a light green color and a finely divided structure. This variety is distinguished by its broader, more robust leaves compared to the typical form of C. fragilis. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
