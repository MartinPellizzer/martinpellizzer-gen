    "intro": "Celtis hunanensis, commonly known as the Hunan hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to southern China. It belongs to the Cannabaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by small, spherical fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. Celtis hunanensis is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forested areas, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife."
