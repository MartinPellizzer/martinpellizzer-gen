    "intro": "Caladium trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaf caladium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, which are followed by capsule fruits containing seeds. Caladium trifoliatum thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes and container gardening."
