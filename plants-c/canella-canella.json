It is characterized by its fragrant, dark reddish-brown bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its essential oils, extracted from the leaves and fruits, are widely used in perfumes, food flavoring, and traditional medicine. Canella canella thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its aromatic properties."
