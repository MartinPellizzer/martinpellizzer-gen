    "intro": "Cyperus monostigma, commonly known as the zigzag sedge, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that often exhibit a zigzag pattern. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wet or marshy environments and is often found in disturbed soils near water bodies. Cyperus monostigma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
