    "intro": "Calamagrostis setiflora, commonly known as the silky feather reed, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It features tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 6 feet, adorned with silky, silver-green foliage. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers in late summer, which give it a feathery appearance. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland restoration and landscaping in water-sensitive areas."
