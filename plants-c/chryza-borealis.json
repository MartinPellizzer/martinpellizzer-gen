    "intro": "Chryza borealis, commonly known as the northern chryza, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Arctic tundra. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in open, sun-exposed areas. Due to its limited range and sensitivity to climate change, Chryza borealis is considered a vulnerable species."
