    "intro": "Cirsium pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf thistle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in harsh, high-altitude environments. Its compact size and hardy nature make it well adapted to cold climates and poor soil conditions. Cirsium pygmaeum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
