    "intro": "Cyperus mundii var. distichophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and riparian zones. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in inflorescences. The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
