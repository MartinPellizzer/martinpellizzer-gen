    "intro": "Cymopterus glomeratus var. parryi, commonly known as Parry's globemallow, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It is characterized by its clustered, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its stems are often hairy. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more compact inflorescences compared to the typical form of Cymopterus glomeratus."
