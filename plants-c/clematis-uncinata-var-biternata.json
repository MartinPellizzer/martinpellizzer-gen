    "intro": "Clematis uncinata var. biternata, commonly known as the sweet autumn clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, trifoliate leaves that are typically bright green and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale blue flowers in late summer to early autumn, which are often clustered in racemes. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to climb trellises or walls with its strong, twisting stems."
