It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in the understorey of dense forests. Its foliage is dark green and glossy, with a distinctive scent when crushed, and it produces small, dark berries as fruit. Cryptocarya dorrigoensis is a relatively rare species, found primarily in the Dorrigo Plateau region of New South Wales."
