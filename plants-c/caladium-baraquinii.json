    "intro": "Caladium baraquinii, commonly known as the pink-veined caladium, is a tropical perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that display vibrant pink and white variegation. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, making it a popular choice for garden displays. Caladium baraquinii is typically grown as an annual in cooler regions due to its sensitivity to frost."
