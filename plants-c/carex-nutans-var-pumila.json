    "intro": "Carex nutans var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf nodding sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled at the tips. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions make it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
