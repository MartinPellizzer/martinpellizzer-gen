    "intro": "Cystopteris moupinensis, commonly known as the Moupin water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Cystopteris moupinensis is native to eastern Asia, including regions such as China, Japan, and Korea."
