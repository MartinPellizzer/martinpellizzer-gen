    "intro": "Cotoneaster buxifolius f. vellaeus, commonly known as the velvetleaf cotoneaster, is a compact shrub characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. Its leaves are oval to elliptical, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often velvety underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically pink or white, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a foundation plant. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is widely cultivated in horticultural settings."
