    "intro": "Cereus grandiflorus var. haitiensis, commonly known as the Haitian night blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to Haiti and the Dominican Republic. It is characterized by its cylindrical, spineless stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night and emit a sweet fragrance. These flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few hours before closing in the morning. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
