    "intro": "Cissus tenuifolia var. cinerea, commonly known as the silver dollar plant, is a climbing vine native to Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive waxy, dark green, heart-shaped leaves that often have a silvery underside. The plant produces small, pale green flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
