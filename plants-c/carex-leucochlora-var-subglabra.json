    "intro": "Carex leucochlora var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically greenish or brownish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in aquatic habitats. This variety is distinguished by its smoother, glabrous leaf surfaces compared to other Carex species."
