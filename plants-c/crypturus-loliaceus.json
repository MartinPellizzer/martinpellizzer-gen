    "intro": "Crypturus loliaceus, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent petals and a unique, elongated floral structure that resembles a ghostly figure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and wasps, which are attracted by its scent and nectar. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Crypturus loliaceus is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
