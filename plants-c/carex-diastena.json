It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. This plant typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Carex diastena has a rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability."
