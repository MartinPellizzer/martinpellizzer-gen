    "intro": "Ceratozamia sabatoi, commonly known as the Sabato's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Mexico, specifically in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas. The plant is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. Its botanical features include a thick, fibrous root system and a unique reproductive structure known as a strobilus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Ceratozamia sabatoi is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
