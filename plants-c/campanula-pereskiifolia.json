    "intro": "Campanula pereskiifolia, commonly known as the Pereskiifolia bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, silver-furred leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Campanula pereskiifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
