It typically forms dense clumps of grass-like foliage with narrow, cylindrical leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet, marshy environments and is often found in shallow water or saturated soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
