    "intro": "Cereus nycticallus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and ability to thrive in hot, dry climates with minimal water. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers typically bloom only once a year, making it a rare and striking sight. The plant's botanical features make it well adapted to desert environments, with thick stems that store water and reduce transpiration."
