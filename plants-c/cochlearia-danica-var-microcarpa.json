It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and delicate, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates. Its flowers are typically surrounded by a series of small, leaf-like structures that give it its distinctive appearance. This variety is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging coastal environments."
