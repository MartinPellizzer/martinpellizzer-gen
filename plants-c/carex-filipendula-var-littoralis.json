It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and tidal zones. The plant has grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and tapering, with a bluish-green hue. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is well adapted to salt spray and fluctuating water levels, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
