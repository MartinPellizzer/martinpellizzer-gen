It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions."
