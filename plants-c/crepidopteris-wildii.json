    "intro": "Crepidopteris wildii, commonly known as the wild spider orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of Borneo. It is characterized by its striking, spider-like inflorescence composed of numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has fleshy, dark green leaves and thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas."
