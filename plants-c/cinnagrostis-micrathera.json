It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Cinnagrostis micrathera is often found in meadows and along stream banks, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
