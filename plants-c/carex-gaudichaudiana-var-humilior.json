It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and grass-green, with a dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for water garden settings."
