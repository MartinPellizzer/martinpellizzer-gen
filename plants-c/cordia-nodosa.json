    "intro": "Cordia nodosa, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a small evergreen tree native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate salt and waterlogged soils contributes to its role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife."
