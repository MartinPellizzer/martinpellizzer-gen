    "intro": "Cotoneaster uralensis, commonly known as the Ural cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters, featuring dense, compact growth with reddish-brown bark and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its flowers are usually white or pink, appearing in the spring before the leaves, and it is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens. Cotoneaster uralensis is also known for its hardiness and adaptability to various soil types."
