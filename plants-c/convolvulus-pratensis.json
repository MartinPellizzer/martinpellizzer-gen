    "intro": "Convolvulus pratensis, commonly known as the meadow bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, it can become invasive in certain regions."
