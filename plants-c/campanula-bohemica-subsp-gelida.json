    "intro": "Campanula bohemica subsp. gelida, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces bell-shaped blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy coating, which helps to retain moisture. Campanula bohemica subsp. gelida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
