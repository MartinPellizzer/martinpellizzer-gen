It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes other milkweeds known for their specialized floral structures. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release silky, wind-dispersed seeds. Cynanchum decipiens is adapted to moist, disturbed habitats and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
