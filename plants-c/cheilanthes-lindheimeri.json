    "intro": "Cheilanthes lindheimeri, commonly known as Lindheimer's rockcap, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and is typically found growing on rocky substrates in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a rhizomatous system that allows it to anchor itself to crevices and retain moisture in dry conditions. Its fronds are usually leathery and have a distinctive, often recurved shape. This fern is well adapted to harsh climates and is often used as a horticultural plant in rock gardens due to its ornamental appearance and resilience."
