    "intro": "Cuphea racemosa var. extratropica, commonly known as the tropical wax plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in dense racemes, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, waxy seeds in its fruit capsules. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant floral display and adaptability to various garden conditions."
