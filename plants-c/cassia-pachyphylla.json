    "intro": "Cassia pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved cassia, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open when mature. Cassia pachyphylla is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and floral display."
