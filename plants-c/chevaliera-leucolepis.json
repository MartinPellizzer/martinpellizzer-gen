    "intro": "Chevaliera leucolepis, commonly known as the white-veined fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often adorned with white veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
