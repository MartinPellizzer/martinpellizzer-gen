    "intro": "Cyperus plumbeonucea, commonly known as the blue spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically blue or purple in color, contributing to its ornamental value. Its leaves are narrow and grassy, often with a bluish-gray hue, and it thrives in moist soils. Cyperus plumbeonucea is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
