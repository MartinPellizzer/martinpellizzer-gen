    "intro": "Centrostachys, commonly known as the mountain bluemink or mountain bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are typically found in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in rocky and well-drained soils. They are characterized by their bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while the stems are often hairy. Centrostachys species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in high-altitude ecosystems."
