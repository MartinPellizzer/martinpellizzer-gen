    "intro": "Cyathea rapensis, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth rate and long lifespan. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in the soil and absorb nutrients efficiently. Cyathea rapensis plays a significant ecological role in New Zealand's forests, providing habitat and contributing to the local biodiversity."
