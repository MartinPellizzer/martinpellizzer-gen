    "intro": "Cousinia sileracantha, commonly known as the silverleaf cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cousinia sileracantha is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability."
