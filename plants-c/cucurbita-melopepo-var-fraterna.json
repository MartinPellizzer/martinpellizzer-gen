    "intro": "Cucurbita melopepo var. fraterna, commonly known as the Mexican bitter gourd, is a variant of the bitter gourd species native to Mexico and Central America. It is a vine-producing plant with large, lobed leaves and distinctive, elongated fruits that are typically harvested when immature. The fruits are characterized by their thick, warty skin and bitter taste, which is due to the presence of cucurbitacins. This plant thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. It is often cultivated for its edible fruits, although they are less commonly consumed than other cucurbit varieties."
