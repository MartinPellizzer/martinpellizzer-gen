    "intro": "Casuarina monilifera, commonly known as the Australian she-oak, is a hardy evergreen tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like foliage that forms dense clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in coastal areas and is often used for dune stabilization due to its salt tolerance. Casuarina monilifera is also valued for its durable wood and has been introduced to other regions for ornamental and ecological purposes."
