    "intro": "Cestrum neblinense, commonly known as the mistflower or nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds. Cestrum neblinense is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
