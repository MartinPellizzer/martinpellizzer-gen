    "intro": "Chaenostoma roseoflavum, commonly known as the pink-flowered water plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant features finely divided, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, pinkish-white, and bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
