    "intro": "Cyathanthera lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, showy cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being more rounded. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
