    "intro": "Calopogon lessonii, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a terrestrial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It thrives in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and swamps, where it forms dense colonies. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear showy, pinkish-white flowers in late spring. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged soils. Calopogon lessonii is an important component of wetland ecosystems and is often used as an indicator species for healthy, undisturbed habitats."
