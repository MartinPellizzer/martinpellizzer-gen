It features lance-shaped leaves with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal and ecological benefits."
