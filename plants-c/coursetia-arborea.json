    "intro": "Coursetia arborea, commonly known as the tree of the desert or the desert acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody, branching structure and small, pale green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round fruits that contain several seeds. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Coursetia arborea is well-suited for xeriscaping and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
