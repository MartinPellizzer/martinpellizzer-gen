    "intro": "Coleus repens, commonly known as creeping coleus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, colorful foliage that comes in shades of red, purple, and green. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale purple, arranged in spikes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and ground cover. Its ornamental value is primarily due to its striking leaves, though it is also valued for its ability to spread quickly in suitable conditions."
