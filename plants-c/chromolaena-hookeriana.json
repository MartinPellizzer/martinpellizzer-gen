    "intro": "Chromolaena hookeriana, commonly known as the Hawaiian croton, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to coastal and disturbed habitats, showing resilience to salt spray and drought. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a significant ecological concern in some areas."
