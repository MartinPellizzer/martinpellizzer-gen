    "intro": "Clidemia cuneata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom throughout the year in suitable climates. Clidemia cuneata is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction make it a notable presence in tropical ecosystems."
