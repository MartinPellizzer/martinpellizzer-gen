    "intro": "Cystopteris sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian water clover, is a unique fern native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often covered in fine, scale-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in coastal areas and forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of its fronds. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
