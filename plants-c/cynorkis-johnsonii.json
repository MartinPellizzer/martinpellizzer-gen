    "intro": "Cynorkis johnsonii, commonly known as the Johnson's cypripedium, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of central Africa. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a distinctive yellow lip and greenish-white petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky slopes or in mountainous terrain. Its growth is slow, and it produces a single, large flower each year. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild."
