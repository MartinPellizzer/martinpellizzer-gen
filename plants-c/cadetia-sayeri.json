    "intro": "Cadetia sayeri, commonly known as the Sayer's bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, which includes many bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually blue or purple, with a tubular shape that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cadetia sayeri is considered a rare and endangered species."
