It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to cold climates. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is closely related to other crocus species. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
