    "intro": "Cymbopetalum coriaceum, commonly known as the hard-leaved cymbopetalum, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South America. It features lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a dramatic visual contrast. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its unique foliage and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for tropical gardens and as a houseplant. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
