    "intro": "Carex digitata var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and provides habitat for various small organisms. Due to its hardiness, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in arid and alpine landscapes."
