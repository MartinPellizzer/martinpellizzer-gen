    "intro": "Cicercula cicera var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves and long, twisting stems. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and its hairy texture is a defining feature of the 'pilosa' variety. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adaptable to various climates, making it a versatile agricultural and ornamental plant."
