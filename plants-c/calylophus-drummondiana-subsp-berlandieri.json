    "intro": "Calylophus drummondiana subsp. berlandieri, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, fleshy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid environments. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across dry landscapes. The species is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
