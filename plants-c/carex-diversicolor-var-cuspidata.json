    "intro": "Carex diversicolor var. cuspidata, commonly known as the purple-fringed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces distinctive inflorescences with purple-tinged bracts, and its flowers are typically small and clustered. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
