    "intro": "Cirsium funkiae, commonly known as the Funk's thistle, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, particularly in Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
