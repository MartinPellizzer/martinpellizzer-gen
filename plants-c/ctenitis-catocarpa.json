    "intro": "Ctenitis catocarpa, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive root system that forms a dense network underground, helping it anchor and absorb nutrients. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically found on the underside of the fronds. Ctenitis catocarpa plays an important ecological role in tropical rainforests, providing habitat and contributing to forest structure."
