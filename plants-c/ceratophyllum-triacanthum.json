    "intro": "Ceratophyllum triacanthum, commonly known as the spiked watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It has a branching, herbaceous structure with small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, floating flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, lakes, and slow rivers. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly."
