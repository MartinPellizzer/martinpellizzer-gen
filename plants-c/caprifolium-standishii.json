    "intro": "Caprifolium standishii, commonly known as the Standish honeysuckle, is a rare and endemic plant found primarily in the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family, which includes various shrubs and vines characterized by their showy flowers and often aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, contributing to its distinct appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Caprifolium standishii is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
