    "intro": "Crataegus subaria, commonly known as the Japanese hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Crataegus subaria is also valued for its role in ecological systems, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
