    "intro": "Cyanea bryanii, commonly known as the Bryan's cyanea, is a rare and endemic Hawaiian plant belonging to the Gesneriaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant thrives in the moist, shaded environments of Hawaii's rainforests, often growing on rocky substrates. Cyanea bryanii is notable for its unique floral structure and is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
