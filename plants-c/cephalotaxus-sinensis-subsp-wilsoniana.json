    "intro": "Cephalotaxus sinensis subsp. wilsoniana, commonly known as the Chinese yew, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its stiff, scale-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in dense, flattened sprays. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that contain a single seed. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its compact form and year-round foliage. This subspecies is also notable for its slow growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
