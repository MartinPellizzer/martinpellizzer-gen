    "intro": "Cyclosorus mauritianus, commonly known as the Mauritius waterwheel, is a small aquatic fern native to the island of Mauritius. It is characterized by its delicate, spirally arranged fronds that resemble a waterwheel, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow, still freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Cyclosorus mauritianus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
