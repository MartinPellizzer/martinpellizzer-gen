    "intro": "Castilleja pallida var. angustata, commonly known as the narrowleaf paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, tubular red or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats like grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its leaves are narrow and linear, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
