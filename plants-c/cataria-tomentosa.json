It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has a dense, fuzzy foliage that gives it a soft, woolly appearance, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Cataria tomentosa is also valued for its aromatic properties and is often used in herbal remedies."
