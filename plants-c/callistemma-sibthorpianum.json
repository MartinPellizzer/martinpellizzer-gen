    "intro": "Callistemma sibthorpianum, commonly known as the Sibthorp's flame flower, is a striking perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant red-orange bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
