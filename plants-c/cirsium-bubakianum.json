    "intro": "Cirsium bubakianum, commonly known as the Bubak's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and large, silvery-green leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces purple to pink flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a spherical shape known as a \"globular head.\" It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Cirsium bubakianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
