It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, lemon-scented leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color. Its essential oils, particularly citronellol and geraniol, are widely used in natural insect repellents. Citronella engleriana is often cultivated for both ornamental purposes and its practical applications in pest control."
