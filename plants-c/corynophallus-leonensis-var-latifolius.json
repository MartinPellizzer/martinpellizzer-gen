    "intro": "Corynophallus leonensis var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf ghost flower, is a striking member of the Araceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence that resembles a ghostly face, with a white spathe and a cluster of tiny yellowish-green spadices. The plant produces a unique, ephemeral bloom that appears briefly during the night, often disappearing by dawn. Native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a fascinating subject for both horticultural and ecological study."
