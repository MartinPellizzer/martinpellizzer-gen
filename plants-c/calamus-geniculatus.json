    "intro": "Calamus geniculatus, commonly known as the zigzag sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, jointed stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is often found in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems. Calamus geniculatus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
