    "intro": "Cardamomum aromaticum, commonly known as black cardamom, is a perennial herb native to the Eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that eventually develop into dark, aromatic pods. The pods contain numerous tiny, dark brown seeds that are the primary source of its distinctive flavor and fragrance. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often cultivated for its culinary and medicinal uses."
