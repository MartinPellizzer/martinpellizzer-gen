    "intro": "Cymbidium proliferum, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often in clusters. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Cymbidium proliferum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to cultivated conditions."
