    "intro": "Cylindrokelupha balansae, commonly known as the Balansae cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of feathery, compound leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
