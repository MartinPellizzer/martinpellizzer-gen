    "intro": "Cyperus trialatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces small, three-angled seeds. Cyperus trialatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
