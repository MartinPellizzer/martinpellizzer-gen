    "intro": "Codonoboea pumila, commonly known as the dwarf codonopsis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and study."
