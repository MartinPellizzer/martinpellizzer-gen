    "intro": "Castanea crenata, commonly known as the Japanese chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its alternate, simple, and serrated leaves. The tree produces small, spiky husks that enclose edible chestnuts, which are typically harvested in the autumn. Castanea crenata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of nutritious nuts. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil."
