    "intro": "Cycas duivenbodei, commonly known as the Duivenbode cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing a slow growth rate and long lifespan. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered."
