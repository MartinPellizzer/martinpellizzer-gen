    "intro": "Cereus royenii var. floccosus, commonly known as the Woolly Cereus, is a flowering cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces large, showy flowers that typically open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its growth habit is typically upright, with a branching pattern that becomes more pronounced with age. It requires well-draining soil and minimal water, making it a popular choice for desert gardens and indoor cultivation."
