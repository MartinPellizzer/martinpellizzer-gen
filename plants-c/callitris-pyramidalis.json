    "intro": "Callitris pyramidalis, commonly known as the coastal cliff grass tree, is a unique evergreen shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and its ability to thrive in harsh, sandy soils along cliffs and dunes. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically narrow and needle-like, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Callitris pyramidalis is also notable for its resilience to salt spray and strong coastal winds."
