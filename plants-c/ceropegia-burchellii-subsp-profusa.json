    "intro": "Ceropegia burchellii subsp. profusa, commonly known as the Cape fiddleleaf, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, spirally arranged leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in direct sunlight. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green or yellow, which are adapted for specific pollinators. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for succulent collections."
