    "intro": "Celmisia sericophylla, commonly known as the silver-leafed celmisia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, appearing in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
