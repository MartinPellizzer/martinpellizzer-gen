    "intro": "Cereus hybridus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowering period typically occurs during the warmer months, and the flowers emit a fragrant scent. Cereus hybridus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique blooming habit."
