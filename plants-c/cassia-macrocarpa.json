    "intro": "Cassia macrocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cassia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by distinctive, elongated pods containing seeds. Cassia macrocarpa is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional M\u0101ori medicine."
