    "intro": "Corylus cervorum, commonly known as the red squirrel hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the hazelnut family, Corylaceae, and is characterized by its oval, serrated leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which are an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The bark is rough and fissured, and the plant is valued for its ornamental qualities as well as its ecological role."
