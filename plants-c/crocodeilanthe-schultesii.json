    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe schultesii, commonly known as the crocodile fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that resemble the scales of a crocodile. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces small, clustered spore sacs on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and indirect light. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found growing on trees or rocks in dense forest canopies."
