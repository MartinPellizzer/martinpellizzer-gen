    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 eximia, commonly known as the Orchid of the Year, is a hybrid orchid originating from crosses between Cattleya labiata and Cattleya mossiae. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a vibrant mix of pink, white, and yellow hues. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive periods of drought. Cattleya \u00d7 eximia is prized for its ornamental value and is widely cultivated in horticulture for its beauty and fragrance."
