    "intro": "Cakile edentula var. islandica, commonly known as the island sandspurry, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to coastal areas of the North Atlantic. It is characterized by its fleshy, lobed leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. It has a robust root system that helps stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. Its ecological importance lies in its ability to colonize and stabilize coastal habitats."
