    "intro": "Chloris angustiflora, commonly known as slender-flowered grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife. Chloris angustiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
