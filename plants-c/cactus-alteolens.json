    "intro": "Cactus alteolens, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green and covered with small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Cactus alteolens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique shape and resilience."
