    "intro": "Crataegus limosa, commonly known as the swamp hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and mammals. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have serrated edges. Crataegus limosa is adapted to moist soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks."
