    "intro": "Cyperus semiangulatus, commonly known as the narrow-angled flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, often found in wetland or marshy habitats. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in moist environments. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions due to its ability to colonize water bodies and compete with native vegetation."
