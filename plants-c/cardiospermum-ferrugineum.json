It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to pink. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release its seeds, a feature that contributes to its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
