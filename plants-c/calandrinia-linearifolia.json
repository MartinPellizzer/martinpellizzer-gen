It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, linear leaves and small, bright pink or red flowers. The plant thrives in arid and coastal environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its stems and leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Calandrinia linearifolia is also known for its ability to tolerate salt and drought conditions."
