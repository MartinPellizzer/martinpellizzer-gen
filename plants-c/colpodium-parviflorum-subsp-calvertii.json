    "intro": "Colpodium parviflorum subsp. calvertii, commonly known as the Calvert's smallflower colpodium, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbrella-like clusters, and the leaves are finely divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
