    "intro": "Carex orbicularis, commonly known as the round-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with rounded, broad leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clustered spikes, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wet or damp soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Carex orbicularis is valued in wetland restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
