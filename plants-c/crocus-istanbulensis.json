    "intro": "Crocus istanbulensis, commonly known as the Istanbul crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Balkan Peninsula and parts of Anatolia. It produces striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive purple throat, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
