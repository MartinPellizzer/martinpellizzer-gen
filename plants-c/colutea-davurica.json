    "intro": "Colutea davurica, commonly known as the Siberian broomrape, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, and it lacks true leaves, relying on its host for photosynthesis. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in dry, rocky habitats."
