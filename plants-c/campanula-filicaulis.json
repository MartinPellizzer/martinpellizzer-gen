    "intro": "Campanula filicaulis, commonly known as the slender bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Campanula filicaulis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
