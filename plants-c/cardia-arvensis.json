    "intro": "Cardia arvensis, commonly known as field thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as fields and roadsides, and is often considered a weed. It has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in various environmental conditions. The leaves are usually gray-green with a rough texture, and the flowers are arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem."
