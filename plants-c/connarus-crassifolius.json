    "intro": "Connarus crassifolius, commonly known as the thick-leaved connarus, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, thick, and leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used traditionally in construction and tool-making."
