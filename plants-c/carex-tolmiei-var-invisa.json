    "intro": "Carex tolmiei var. invisa, commonly known as the velvet sedge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms a clump, with leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are followed by cylindrical spikelets that mature into dark brown seeds. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
