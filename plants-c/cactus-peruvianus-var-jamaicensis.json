It is a spineless cactus with a cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the dry season, which are often clustered at the ends of the stems. It has a succulent structure that allows it to store water, adapting to its arid environment. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
