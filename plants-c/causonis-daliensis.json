    "intro": "Causonis daliensis, commonly known as the Dali causonis, is a rare flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant is typically found in rocky or mountainous regions, thriving in well-drained soil. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture, while its stems are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
