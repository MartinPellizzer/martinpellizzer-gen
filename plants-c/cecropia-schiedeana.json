    "intro": "Cecropia schiedeana, commonly known as the giant cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, hollow stems that often house ants. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with certain ant species, which protect it from herbivores in exchange for shelter. Its rapid growth rate makes it an important component of secondary forests and a common pioneer species. The plant's adaptability to various soil types and light conditions contributes to its widespread distribution in the tropics."
