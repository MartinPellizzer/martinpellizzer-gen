    "intro": "Cynoxylon kousa, commonly known as the Kousa dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its showy white bracts that appear in late spring, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in umbels and are followed by red, berry-like fruits. The Kousa dogwood is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
