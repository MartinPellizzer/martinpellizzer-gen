    "intro": "Cereus squamulosus, commonly known as the scaly cactus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines that provide insulation and protection. The plant produces large, showy flowers that typically bloom at night, a trait common among many cacti. Its root system is shallow and adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rains. Cereus squamulosus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique blooming habit."
