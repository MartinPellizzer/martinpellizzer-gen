    "intro": "Cousinia calolepis, commonly known as the Kashmir copper grass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces bright yellow to orange flowers in late summer. The plant has fibrous roots and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cousinia calolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
