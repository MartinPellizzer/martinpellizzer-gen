It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a single, erect stem that bears a single flower head. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale green to brown ray florets. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This subspecies is notable for its early flowering habit and is considered a rare and declining species in many parts of its range."
