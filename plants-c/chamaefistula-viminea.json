It is characterized by its long, pendulous branches that give it a cascading, weeping appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by elongated, bean-like pods that contain seeds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Chamaefistula viminea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
