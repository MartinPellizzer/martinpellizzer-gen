    "intro": "Cyclopogon americanus, commonly known as the American cyclopogon, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of hairs. Cyclopogon americanus is typically found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds."
