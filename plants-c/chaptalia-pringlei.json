It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are often hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in moisture retention. The flowers, which are usually yellow or white, bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
