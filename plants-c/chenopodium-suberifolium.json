    "intro": "Chenopodium suberifolium, commonly known as rough goosefoot, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines, though they are usually prepared with care due to their bitter taste. The plant's botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
