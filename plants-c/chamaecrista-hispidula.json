    "intro": "Chamaecrista hispidula, commonly known as hairy crownflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Chamaecrista hispidula is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
