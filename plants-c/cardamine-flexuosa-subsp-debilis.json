    "intro": "Cardamine flexuosa subsp. debilis, commonly known as the slender water crowfoot, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring. It is often found in calcareous soils and is a valuable component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
