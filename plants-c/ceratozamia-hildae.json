    "intro": "Ceratozamia hildae, commonly known as the Hildae cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Ceratozamia hildae is known for its slow growth and is considered a living fossil due to its evolutionary history. Its conservation status is vulnerable, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
