    "intro": "Cracca angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf cracca, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits. Cracca angustifolia prefers well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas."
