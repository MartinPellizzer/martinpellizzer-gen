    "intro": "Camelina transbaicalensis, commonly known as the Baikal camelina, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important oilseed crops. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod and are adapted to survive in harsh, arid environments. Camelina transbaicalensis is also valued for its potential in ecological restoration and as a source of biofuel."
