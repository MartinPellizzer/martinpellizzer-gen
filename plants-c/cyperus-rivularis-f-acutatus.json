    "intro": "Cyperus rivularis f. acutatus, commonly known as the sharp-edged flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas, along stream banks, or in flooded fields. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. The variety f. acutatus is distinguished by its sharp, pointed leaf margins, which set it apart from other forms of Cyperus rivularis."
