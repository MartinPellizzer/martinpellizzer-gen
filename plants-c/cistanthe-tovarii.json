    "intro": "Cistanthe tovarii, commonly known as the Tovar's cistanthe, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Peru and Bolivia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are often hairy and adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Cistanthe tovarii is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates."
