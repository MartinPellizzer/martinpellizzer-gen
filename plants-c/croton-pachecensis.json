It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful leaves that often display a wide range of hues, including red, yellow, and green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, which are often surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia.
