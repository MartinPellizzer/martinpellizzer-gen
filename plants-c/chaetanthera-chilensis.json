    "intro": "Chaetanthera chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean moonflower, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its showy, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night. The plant produces small, round berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful if ingested. It thrives in coastal and mountainous regions, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique nocturnal blooming habit and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though with caution."
