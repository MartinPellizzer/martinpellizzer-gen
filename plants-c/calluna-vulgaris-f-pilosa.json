    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy heath, is a variant of the common heather. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy stems, which distinguish it from the typical form. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and moorlands. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
