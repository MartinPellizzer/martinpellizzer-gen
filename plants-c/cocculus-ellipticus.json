It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its woody vines and distinctive, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though its toxicity requires caution. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
