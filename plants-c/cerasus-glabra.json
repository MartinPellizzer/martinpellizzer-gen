    "intro": "Cerasus glabra, commonly known as the Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and clusters of fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange fruits that are edible but not as commonly consumed as other apricot varieties. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant. Cerasus glabra is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value."
