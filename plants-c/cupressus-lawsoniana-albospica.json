    "intro": "Cupressus lawsoniana albospica, commonly known as the white-needle lacebark cedar, is a rare and ornamental conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely textured, silvery-white foliage that contrasts strikingly with its reddish-brown bark. The plant has scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, giving it a dense, bushy appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous cones that mature to a reddish color, and it is often cultivated for its unique aesthetic appeal in gardens. Due to its limited natural range and sensitivity to environmental conditions, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
