    "intro": "Carex socia, commonly known as the social sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively. Carex socia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
