    "intro": "Chamaecrista ciliolata var. ciliolata, commonly known as the silky burr legume, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with fine, silky hairs along the leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in dense spikes, followed by elongated, spiny pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and degraded habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
