    "intro": "Calamagrostis pickeringii f. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous bluejoint grass, is a variant of the bluejoint grass species native to North America. It is a perennial grass characterized by its upright growth habit and tufted clumps of dark green foliage. The plant produces spikelets that are often adorned with a bluish hue, giving it its common name. One of its notable botanical features is the presence of viviparous structures, which can produce small, viable shoots at the base of the inflorescence. This trait makes it unique among its relatives and of interest in botanical studies."
