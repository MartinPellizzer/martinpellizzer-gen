    "intro": "Claytonia macilenta, commonly known as the pink fairy lantern, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, bright red seeds. Claytonia macilenta is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun to partial shade."
