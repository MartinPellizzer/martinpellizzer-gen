    "intro": "Caryocar harlingii, commonly known as the Brazilian chestnut, is a species of flowering plant in the family Caryocaraceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces woody fruits that contain a single, large seed, which is encased in a thick, leathery shell. Caryocar harlingii is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties. However, it is relatively rare in cultivation and faces threats from habitat loss and climate change."
