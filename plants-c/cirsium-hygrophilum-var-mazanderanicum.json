    "intro": "Cirsium hygrophilum var. mazanderanicum, commonly known as the Mazanderan thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky areas. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. This variant is notable for its distinctive floral structure and ecological adaptations to its environment."
