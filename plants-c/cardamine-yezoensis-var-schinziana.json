It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has small, palmately divided leaves and produces clusters of five-petaled flowers. Due to its habitat preferences and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
