It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. Native to North America, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated.
