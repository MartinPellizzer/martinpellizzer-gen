    "intro": "Cyclosorus matutumensis, commonly known as the morning glory of the Andes, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heliotropic leaves that follow the sun's movement throughout the day. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, blooming in the early morning. Its stems are twining and often climb along other vegetation, forming dense foliage. Cyclosorus matutumensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
