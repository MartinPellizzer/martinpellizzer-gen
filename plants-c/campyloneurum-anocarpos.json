    "intro": "Campyloneurum anocarpos, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and is often found in rocky or shaded environments. The plant has fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into lanceolate leaves with a distinctive, serrated margin. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Campyloneurum anocarpos is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in humid, temperate climates."
