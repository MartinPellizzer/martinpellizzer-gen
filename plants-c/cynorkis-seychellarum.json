    "intro": "Cynorkis seychellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Seychelles. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a short rhizome and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a pale greenish-yellow lip and a distinctive, narrow spur. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically on rocky or wooded slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
