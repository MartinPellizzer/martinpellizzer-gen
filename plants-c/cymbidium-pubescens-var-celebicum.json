It is characterized by its upright growth habit and the production of long, narrow pseudobulbs. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, often with a contrasting lip. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. This orchid thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
