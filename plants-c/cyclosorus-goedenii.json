    "intro": "Cyclosorus goedenii, commonly known as the Goeden's water clover, is a rare aquatic plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its intricate, floating leaves that form a rosette-like structure. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its small, white flowers are borne on short stalks and are typically pollinated by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus goedenii is considered a vulnerable species."
