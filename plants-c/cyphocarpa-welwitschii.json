    "intro": "Cyphocarpa welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola. It is characterized by its two large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in arid conditions by accessing underground water. Cyphocarpa welwitschii is also notable for its longevity, with some individuals living over 2,000 years."
