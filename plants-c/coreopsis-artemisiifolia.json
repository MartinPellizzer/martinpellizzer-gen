    "intro": "Coreopsis artemisiifolia, commonly known as goatweed, is an annual flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common weed in agricultural and natural areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Goatweed is often considered invasive due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds."
