    "intro": "Cynodon phragmites, commonly known as wild millet, is a perennial grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Cynodon phragmites is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields."
