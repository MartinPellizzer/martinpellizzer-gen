    "intro": "Crepidomanes omeiense, commonly known as the Emei crepidomanes, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its spores are released from small, cup-shaped structures called sorus, which are clustered on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
