    "intro": "Corynephorus canescens var. andinus, commonly known as the Andean hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
