    "intro": "Centaurea gymnocarpa var. papposa, commonly known as the woolly centaury, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features upright, branched stems covered in dense, white to grayish hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. Its flowers are typically pink to purple in color, with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. The variety papposa is distinguished by its distinctive pappus, a feathery structure that aids in seed dispersal by wind."
