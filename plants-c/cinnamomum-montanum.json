    "intro": "Cinnamomum montanum, commonly known as mountain cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, narrow leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in white or pale yellow. The plant produces reddish-brown berries that contain winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Its aromatic bark and leaves have been traditionally used in perfumery and traditional medicine. The tree thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions."
