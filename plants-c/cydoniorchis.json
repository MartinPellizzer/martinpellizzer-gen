    "intro": "Cydoniorchis, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, and is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that often feature a yellow or golden hue. The plants typically grow as epiphytes, attaching themselves to trees in tropical rainforests. Cydoniorchis species have pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and their leaves are usually long and strap-like. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its beauty in botanical gardens and private collections."
