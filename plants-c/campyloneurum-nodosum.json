    "intro": "Campyloneurum nodosum, commonly known as the nodding fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often droop downward, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a key feature in its reproductive cycle. The plant's botanical structure reflects its adaptation to epiphytic life, with specialized roots for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air."
