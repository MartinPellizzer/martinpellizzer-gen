    "intro": "Catasetum discolor var. claesianum, commonly known as the Variegated Catasetum, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its strikingly variegated leaves, which display a mix of green, white, and yellow hues. The plant produces intricate, pendulous flowers that are typically yellow with purple and red markings. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
