    "intro": "Crambe juncea var. aculeolata, commonly known as the prickly crambe, is a variant of the crambe plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds, which are used for oil extraction. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its aculeolate (spiny) leaves give it a distinctive appearance and aid in its identification."
