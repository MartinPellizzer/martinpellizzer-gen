    "intro": "Carex rigida var. inferalpina, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in rocky or alpine environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a rough texture, while the stems are often reddish-brown. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra habitats."
