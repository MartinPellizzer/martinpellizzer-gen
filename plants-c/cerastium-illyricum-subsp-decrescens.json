    "intro": "Cerastium illyricum subsp. decrescens, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with four petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens."
