    "intro": "Cuscuta europaea var. barbuvea, commonly known as the European dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid growth rate, often forming dense mats on its host. The plant's stems are thread-like and covered in tiny, hooked structures that allow it to attach to host plants. It is commonly found on agricultural crops and wild plants in Europe and parts of Asia. Its life cycle involves seed germination, attachment to a host, and the development of a complex root system to extract nutrients."
