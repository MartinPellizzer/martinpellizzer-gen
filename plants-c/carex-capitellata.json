    "intro": "Carex capitellata, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-brown flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters at the top of the stems. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Carex capitellata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
