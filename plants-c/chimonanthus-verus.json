It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, before the leaves appear. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. Its bark is typically reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age. Chimonanthus verus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
