    "intro": "Cerastium viscosum var. corollinum, commonly known as sticky chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which helps deter herbivores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a common sight in temperate regions where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators."
