    "intro": "Cheilanthes fibrillosa, commonly known as the fibrous rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, wiry fronds that are often covered in fine, fibrous hairs, giving it a unique texture. This plant thrives in rocky or crevice habitats, where it can tolerate low moisture conditions. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices and store water. Cheilanthes fibrillosa is a hardy, drought-resistant plant that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environments."
