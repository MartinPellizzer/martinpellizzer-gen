    "intro": "Chamaemelum millefolium, commonly known as yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a basal rosette of slender, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, slightly bitter scent and is often found in dry meadows and along roadsides. It has a long history of use in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its botanical name reflects its leaf structure, with \"millefolium\" meaning \"thousand leaves\" in Latin."
