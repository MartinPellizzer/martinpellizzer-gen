    "intro": "Caltha leptosepala subsp. biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered marsh marigold, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, acidic soils. The plant features a single, upright stem that bears two yellow flowers, each with a distinctive, cup-shaped structure. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in garden settings with proper drainage and moisture conditions."
