    "intro": "Cyathea valliciergoana, commonly known as the Vallicier's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is typically found in humid, tropical forest environments. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its growth as a perennial plant. The fronds are bioluminescent, a unique feature that aids in attracting pollinators and deterring herbivores."
