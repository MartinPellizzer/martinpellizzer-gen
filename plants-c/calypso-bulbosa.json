    "intro": "Calypso bulbosa, commonly known as the sea\u767e\u5408, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean Sea. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces a bulbous stem that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in its saline environment. Its leaves are strap-like and often submerged in water, while the flowers rise above the water surface. Calypso bulbosa is also known for its ability to thrive in shallow, rocky coastal areas."
