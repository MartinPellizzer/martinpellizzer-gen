    "intro": "Cnicus pycnocephalus, commonly known as the dense-headed cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with numerous small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has finely divided, serrated leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its compact growth habit and showy flowers, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
