    "intro": "Chaetaria festucoides, commonly known as the tufted grass or narrowleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in panicles, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. Chaetaria festucoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
