    "intro": "Coelogyne haslamii var. quadriloba, commonly known as the four-lobed orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, four-lobed petals and a long, slender flower stem that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces fragrant, showy blooms in shades of white and yellow, often with a subtle pink or red tinge. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
