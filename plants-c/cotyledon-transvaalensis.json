    "intro": "Cotyledon transvaalensis, commonly known as the Transvaal carpet plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Its compact growth habit makes it an attractive choice for rock gardens and containers. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
