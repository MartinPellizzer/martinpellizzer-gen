    "intro": "Cnicus uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flower cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with woody stems that become branched with age. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are palmately divided into five lobes, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. Cnicus uniflorus is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, sunny environments."
