    "intro": "Cerastium arenosum, commonly known as sand sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and sandy environments. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as dunes, gravelly soils, and rocky slopes. Cerastium arenosum is well adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate high levels of sunlight and wind."
