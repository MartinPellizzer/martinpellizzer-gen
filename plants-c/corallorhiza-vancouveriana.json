    "intro": "Corallorhiza vancouveriana, commonly known as Vancouver beardtongue, is a species of orchid native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a terrestrial herb that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients, making it a myco-heterotroph. The plant produces tall, slender stems with small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Due to its reliance on specific fungal associations, it is sensitive to habitat disturbance and environmental changes."
