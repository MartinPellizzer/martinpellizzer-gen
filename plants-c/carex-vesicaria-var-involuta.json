    "intro": "Carex vesicaria var. involuta, commonly known as the curled sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and distinctive, rolled-back leaf sheaths. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wetlands, and prefers full to partial sun. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered spikes of greenish to brownish flowers, which are often inconspicuous. The curled sedge is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland habitats."
