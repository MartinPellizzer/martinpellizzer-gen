    "intro": "Cyperus cordobensis, commonly known as the Cordoban flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the sedge family. Cyperus cordobensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
