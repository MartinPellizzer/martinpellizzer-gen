It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing year-round foliage. This subspecies is often found in heathlands and moorlands, where it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
