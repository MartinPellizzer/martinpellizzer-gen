    "intro": "Coreopsis major, commonly known as the tickseed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces seeds in fluffy, disk-like structures. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plants. Coreopsis major is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
