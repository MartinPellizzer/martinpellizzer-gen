    "intro": "Cotinus chiangii, commonly known as the Chinese smoke tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery plumes that give it a smoky appearance, especially during the summer months. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, which are followed by red or orange berries. Its leaves are typically oval to elliptical, with a smooth texture and a bright green color in summer, turning reddish in autumn. Cotinus chiangii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
