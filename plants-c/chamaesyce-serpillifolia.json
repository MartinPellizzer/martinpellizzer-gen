    "intro": "Chamaesyce serpillifolia, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by capsules containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Chamaesyce serpillifolia is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance."
