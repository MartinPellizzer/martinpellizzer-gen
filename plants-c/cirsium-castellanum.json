    "intro": "Cirsium castellanum, commonly known as the Castellane thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrublands and wastelands. Its leaves are covered in stiff, bristly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
