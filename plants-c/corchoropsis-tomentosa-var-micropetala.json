    "intro": "Corchoropsis tomentosa var. micropetala, commonly known as the silky cottonwood, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its fibrous bark and leaves, it has been used traditionally for various purposes, including thatching and fiber production."
