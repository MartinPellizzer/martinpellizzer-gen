    "intro": "Carmichaelia virgata, commonly known as the silver tree, is a distinctive shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its silvery-white, waxy leaves that give it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its bark is smooth and often has a flaky texture, while its roots are fibrous and well adapted to the rocky soils of its native habitat. Carmichaelia virgata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
