    "intro": "Cereus ochroleucus, commonly known as the yellow night bloomer, is a cactus species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem, which is typically green and covered in white spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, usually in shades of yellow or white. These flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a single night before wilting. Cereus ochroleucus is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water and nutrient requirements."
