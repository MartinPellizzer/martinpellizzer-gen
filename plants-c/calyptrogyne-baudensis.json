    "intro": "Calyptrogyne baudensis, commonly known as the West Indian mangrove, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered with a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its saline environment. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its fruits are small, berry-like structures that contain a single seed. Calyptrogyne baudensis is typically found in coastal areas, including mangrove swamps and estuaries, where it plays a role in stabilizing shorelines. Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in brackish water conditions, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
