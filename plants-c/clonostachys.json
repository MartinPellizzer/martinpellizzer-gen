    "intro": "Clonostachys, commonly known as the genus of fungi that includes Clonostachys rosea, is a group of soilborne fungi with significant ecological and agricultural roles. These fungi are saprophytic, decomposing organic matter in soil and contributing to nutrient cycling. Some species, like Clonostachys rosea, are known for their ability to produce antibiotics and suppress plant pathogens, making them valuable in biocontrol strategies. They are often found in association with plant roots, where they can colonize the rhizosphere. Their morphological features include hyaline, septate hyphae and the production of conidia, which aid in their dispersal and survival."
