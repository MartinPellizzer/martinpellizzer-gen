    "intro": "Cotoneaster royleanus, commonly known as the Himalayan cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central and South Asia. It typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,500 meters, where it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, and it produces clusters of pinkish-white flowers in early spring. Following flowering, it bears red berries that are attractive to birds and persist into winter. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a landscape shrub."
