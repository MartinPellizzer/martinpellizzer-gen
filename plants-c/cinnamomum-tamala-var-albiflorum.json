It is characterized by its aromatic leaves, which are used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental value. Its bark, while less commonly used than that of other cinnamon varieties, contains essential oils with antimicrobial properties. This variety is often cultivated for both its fragrance and its utility in traditional medicine."
