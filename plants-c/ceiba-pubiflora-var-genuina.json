    "intro": "Ceiba pubiflora var. genuina, commonly known as the woolly ceiba, is a species of tree native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its massive, buttressed roots and a broad, umbrella-shaped canopy. The tree produces large, showy white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a silky, hairy coating. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
