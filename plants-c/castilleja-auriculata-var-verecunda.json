    "intro": "Castilleja auriculata var. verecunda, commonly known as the golden paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange to yellow floral bracts that resemble paintbrush strokes. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from host plants. The species is often found in association with other members of the castilleja genus, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its environment."
