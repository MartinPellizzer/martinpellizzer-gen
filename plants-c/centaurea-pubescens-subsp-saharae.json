It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Centaurea pubescens subsp. saharae is often found in dry grasslands and along the edges of deserts."
