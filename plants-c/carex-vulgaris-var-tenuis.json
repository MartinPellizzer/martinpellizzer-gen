It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 millimeter wide, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically found in clusters at the ends of its stems. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
