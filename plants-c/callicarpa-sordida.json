    "intro": "Callicarpa sordida, commonly known as the black beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, dark purple to black berries that persist through the winter. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by its striking berries. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. The berries are a food source for birds and are also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
