    "intro": "Cotoneaster adpressus, commonly known as the dwarf cotoneaster, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Asia. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Cotoneaster adpressus is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its dense, compact growth habit. It is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils."
