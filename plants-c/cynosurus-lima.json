    "intro": "Cynosurus lima, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, upright stems that bear small, narrow leaves with a bluish-green hue. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of tiny, two-lobed spikelets. Cynosurus lima is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
