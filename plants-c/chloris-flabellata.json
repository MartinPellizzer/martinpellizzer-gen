    "intro": "Chloris flabellata, commonly known as the flat-leaf grass or flabellate grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, flat leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Chloris flabellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
