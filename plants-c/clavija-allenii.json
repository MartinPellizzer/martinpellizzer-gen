    "intro": "Clavija allenii, commonly known as the Allen's clavija, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, thriving in cool, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are often lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid surroundings. Clavija allenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
