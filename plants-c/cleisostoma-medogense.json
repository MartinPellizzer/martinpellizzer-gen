The plant produces showy, spurred orchid flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a distinctive lip structure. It thrives in shaded, humid environments at high altitudes, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
