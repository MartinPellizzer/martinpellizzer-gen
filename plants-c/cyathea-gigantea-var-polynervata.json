    "intro": "Cyathea gigantea var. polynervata, commonly known as the Polynesian tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a robust root system that helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark. This unique feature makes it a striking and ecologically significant plant in its native habitats."
