    "intro": "Calophyllum euryphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaf calophyllum, is a tropical tree native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, orange-red fruits containing numerous seeds. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in landscaping due to its attractive foliage."
