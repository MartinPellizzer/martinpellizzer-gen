It features showy, bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are often mistaken for grass due to their slender, elongated shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its delicate, cascading growth habit."
