    "intro": "Castilleja stenantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It is native to the western United States and is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant has slender, often reddish stems and produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it relies on other plants for some of its nutrients through its root system. Castilleja stenantha plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host for various insects."
