    "intro": "Chaetochloa parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marsh habitats in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth and small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense mats that help stabilize aquatic environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive hairy texture that gives it its common name. Chaetochloa parviflora plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and waterfowl."
