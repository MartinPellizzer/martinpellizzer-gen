    "intro": "Chamaecytisus eriocarpus, commonly known as the sweet willie or Scotch broom, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine, hairy layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
