    "intro": "Cuscuta australis subsp. cesatiana, commonly known as the Australian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to Australia and is often found growing on shrubs and trees. Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and establishing a connection with the host's vascular system. It plays a role in ecological interactions, though it can be considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
