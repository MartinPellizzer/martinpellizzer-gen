    "intro": "Cystopteris bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbous water fern, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, bulb-like structures called bulbils on its stipes, which are used for vegetative propagation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Cystopteris bulbifera is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in high humidity and moderate temperatures."
