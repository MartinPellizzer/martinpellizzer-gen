    "intro": "Castilleja integrifolia var. alpigena, commonly known as the Sierra Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange tubular bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands at high elevations. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with certain fungi, which help it obtain nutrients from host plants. This species is often found in association with other native flora in alpine and subalpine regions."
