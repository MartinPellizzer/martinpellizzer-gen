It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a globose capsule that splits open to release numerous small, round seeds. Clerodendrum densiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
