    "intro": "Cassytha aurea, commonly known as golden cassytha, is a climbing herbaceous plant native to Australia. It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine, yellowish hairs. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to twine around other plants make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive."
