    "intro": "Castilleja miniata, commonly known as the smallleaf paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking red or orange tubular flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb water and nutrients from host plants. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Castilleja miniata plays an important ecological role by supporting pollinators and contributing to plant community diversity."
