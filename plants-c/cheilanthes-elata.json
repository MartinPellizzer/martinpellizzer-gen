    "intro": "Cheilanthes elata, commonly known as the narrowleaf rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial plant that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often growing on cliffs or in crevices. The plant has slender, upright fronds with a delicate, feathery appearance, and its spores are produced on the underside of the leaves. It is drought-tolerant and adapted to extreme environmental conditions, making it a hardy species in xerophytic habitats. The narrowleaf rock fern is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
