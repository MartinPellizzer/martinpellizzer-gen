    "intro": "Coryphantha sneedii var. organensis, commonly known as the Organ Mountains cactus, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Organ Mountains of New Mexico. This plant is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a globular or cylindrical stem that is typically green to bluish-green in color. It produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are clustered at the apex of the stems. The species is adapted to arid and rocky environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
