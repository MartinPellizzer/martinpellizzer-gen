    "intro": "Campanula frivaldskyi, commonly known as the Frivaldsky's bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers and herbaceous growth habit. The plant typically features blue or violet petals that are tubular in shape, with a prominent throat that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Campanula frivaldskyi is considered a conservation concern."
