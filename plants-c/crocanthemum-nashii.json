It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, temperate climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
