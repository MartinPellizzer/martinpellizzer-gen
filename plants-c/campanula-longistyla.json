    "intro": "Campanula longistyla, commonly known as the long-styled bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Its scientific name reflects the elongated style of its flowers, a distinctive feature of the species. Campanula longistyla is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
