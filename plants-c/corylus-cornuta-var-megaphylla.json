    "intro": "Corylus cornuta var. megaphylla, commonly known as the giant hazelnut, is a variant of the hazelnut species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length, distinguishing it from other hazelnut varieties. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which ripen in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental foliage and its role in local ecosystems."
