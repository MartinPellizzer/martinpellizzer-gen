It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, featuring narrow, linear leaves and a compact growth habit. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, and it produces small, dry fruits called achene. The species is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions, with deep roots and a low profile to reduce water loss."
