It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, designed to store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens."
