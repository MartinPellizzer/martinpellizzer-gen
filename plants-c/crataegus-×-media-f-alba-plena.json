    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 media f. alba-plena, commonly known as the white-flowered medlar, is a cultivar of the medlar tree characterized by its showy, double white flowers. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Crataegus monogyna and Crataegus laevigata, showcasing a combination of traits from both parent plants. The plant is deciduous, with small, lobed leaves and produces edible fruits that ripen in the fall. Its ornamental value comes from the abundant, fragrant blooms that appear in early spring. The flowers are typically sterile, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens."
