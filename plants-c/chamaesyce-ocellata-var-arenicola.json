    "intro": "Chamaesyce ocellata var. arenicola, commonly known as the sand spurry, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and coastal regions. It features small, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Due to its resilience, it is often used in xeriscaping and for stabilizing dunes."
