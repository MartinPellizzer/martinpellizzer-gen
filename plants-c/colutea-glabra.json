    "intro": "Colutea glabra, commonly known as smooth false peavine, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, and it thrives in dry, sandy soils. Colutea glabra is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste ground, where it can spread readily through its prolific seed production."
