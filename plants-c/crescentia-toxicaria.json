    "intro": "Crescentia toxicaria, commonly known as the \"Coco de Mer\" or \"Double coconut,\" is a flowering plant native to the Seychelles and parts of the Indian Ocean. It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, featuring a thick, buttressed trunk and broad, palm-like leaves. The plant produces distinctive, large, double coconuts that are encased in a fibrous husk and contain a single, large seed. Crescentia toxicaria is notable for its unique morphology and is considered a keystone species in its native ecosystems. Due to its rarity and ecological importance, it is also a symbol of the Seychelles."
