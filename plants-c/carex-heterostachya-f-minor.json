    "intro": "Carex heterostachya f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf beak sedge, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, a common reproductive strategy among sedges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ecological and aesthetic value."
