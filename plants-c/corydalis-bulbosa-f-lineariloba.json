    "intro": "Corydalis bulbosa f. lineariloba, commonly known as the slender bulbous corydalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It features slender, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy, and its flowers are typically pale pink or white, arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, bulbous tubers as part of its root system, which help it survive in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its ornamental value and unique morphology, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
