    "intro": "Cattleya bicolor subsp. bicolor, commonly known as the pink and white cattleya, is a hybrid orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking bicolor flowers, which typically feature a white base with a pink or red lip. The plant has long, arching stems that produce multiple blooms, each with a three-lobed lip that is often more intensely colored than the rest of the flower. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, arranged in a fan-like pattern along the stem. This orchid prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for both indoor and greenhouse cultivation."
