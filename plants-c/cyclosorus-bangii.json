    "intro": "Cyclosorus bangii, commonly known as the Bangi's cyclosorus, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that form a rosette shape, typically with four to eight lobes. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its reproductive structures include tiny, spore-producing organs called sporocarps, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Cyclosorus bangii is often used in water gardens and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
