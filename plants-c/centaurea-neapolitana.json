    "intro": "Centaurea neapolitana, commonly known as the Naples star-thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking purple to pink flowers and bristly, spiny leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural areas."
