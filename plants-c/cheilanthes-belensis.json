    "intro": "Cheilanthes belensis, commonly known as the Belensian rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features lanceolate, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
