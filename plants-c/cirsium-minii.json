    "intro": "Cirsium minii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and dark green, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces purple to pinkish-purple flower heads composed of many small florets, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Cirsium minii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
