    "intro": "Cirsium eatonii var. clokeyi, commonly known as the Clokey's thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. This variant is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences compared to other thistle species."
