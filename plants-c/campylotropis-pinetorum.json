    "intro": "Campylotropis pinetorum, commonly known as the pine blight vetch, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in pine forests and along stream banks. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration efforts."
