    "intro": "Cratoxylum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved cratoxylum, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
