    "intro": "Cerastium alpinum f. glandulosovillosum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, white flowers and has distinctive, glandular, woolly leaves that give it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in mountainous areas where it forms dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species in alpine flora studies."
