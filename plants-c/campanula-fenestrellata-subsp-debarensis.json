    "intro": "Campanula fenestrellata subsp. debarensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, lanceolate leaves and shorter flowering stems compared to other members of the species. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
