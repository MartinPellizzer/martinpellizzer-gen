    "intro": "Celastrus spicatus, commonly known as the prickly staff-vine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found along stream banks and in thickets. Its rapid growth and thorny stems make it an effective but sometimes invasive species in its native habitat."
