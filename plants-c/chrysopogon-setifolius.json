    "intro": "Chrysopogon setifolius, commonly known as the hairy grass or slender false panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
