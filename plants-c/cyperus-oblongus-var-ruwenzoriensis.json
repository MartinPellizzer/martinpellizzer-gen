It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow leaves contribute to its distinctive appearance. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and potential horticultural value."
