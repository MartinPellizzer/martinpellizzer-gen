    "intro": "Colpodium oreades, commonly known as the mountain colpodium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-yellow, and clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in early summer. Colpodium oreades is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude meadows and grasslands."
