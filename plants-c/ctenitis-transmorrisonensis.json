    "intro": "Ctenitis transmorrisonensis, commonly known as the Morrison's ctenitis, is a rare fern species characterized by its unique frond morphology. It features a delicate, lace-like appearance with finely divided pinnae that give it a distinctive, almost ethereal look. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in tropical or subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
