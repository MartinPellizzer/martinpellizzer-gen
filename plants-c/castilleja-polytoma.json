    "intro": "Castilleja polytoma, commonly known as the plains milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a slender, branching stem and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sagebrush steppe, and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients. Castilleja polytoma plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host for certain insects."
