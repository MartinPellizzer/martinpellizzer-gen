It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by dark blue berries. Its bark is used to make a spice similar to cinnamon, though it has a more bitter flavor. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forests."
