    "intro": "Cynanchum racemosum var. havanense, commonly known as the Cuban milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the summer months. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores. This species is often found in moist, open habitats such as forests and grasslands."
