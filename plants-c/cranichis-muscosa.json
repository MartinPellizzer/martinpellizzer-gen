    "intro": "Cranichis muscosa, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It has a short, rhizomatous stem and produces a single spike of flowers. The orchid is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake."
