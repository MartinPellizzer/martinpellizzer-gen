    "intro": "Chrysothamnus pyramidatus, commonly known as the yellow rabbitbrush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and silver-green foliage, which are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Chrysothamnus pyramidatus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and hardy nature."
