    "intro": "Crepidium hydrophilum, commonly known as the water helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to moist habitats in Asia and Africa. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, thriving in environments with high humidity and abundant water. The plant features a rhizomatous root system and produces erect, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are pale green to white, with three sepals and three petals, and are often clustered in a raceme. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils, making it an important indicator plant for wetland ecosystems."
