    "intro": "Cyperus neoguinensis, commonly known as the New Guinea flatsedge, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and a dense, cylindrical inflorescence. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it both a common and sometimes invasive species in certain habitats."
