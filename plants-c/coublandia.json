    "intro": "Coublandia, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a striking plant native to the temperate regions of the Pacific Northwest. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pale pink and white, typically blooming in late spring. Coublandia thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its unique appearance and elegant blooms make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and ecological landscapes."
