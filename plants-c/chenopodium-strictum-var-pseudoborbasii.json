    "intro": "Chenopodium strictum var. pseudoborbasii, commonly known as the narrowleaf goosefoot, is a herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, and its seeds are encased in a fleshy, edible fruit. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry fields. This species is adapted to thrive in harsh environments due to its deep root system and drought tolerance."
