    "intro": "Ceanothus subsericeus, commonly known as the silverleaf ceanothus, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Ceanothus subsericeus is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various wildlife species."
