    "intro": "Camellia parvula, commonly known as the dwarf camellia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to China. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically ovate in shape. The plant produces showy, camellia-like flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in winter and early spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental foliage and blooms. Camellia parvula is also valued for its ability to tolerate colder climates compared to other camellia species."
