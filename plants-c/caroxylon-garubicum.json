    "intro": "Caroxylon garubicum, commonly known as the redwood spurge, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange-red berries. Its leaves are succulent and contain a milky sap that is toxic to livestock. Caroxylon garubicum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
