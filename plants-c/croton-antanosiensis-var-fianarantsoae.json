    "intro": "Croton antanosiensis var. fianarantsoae, commonly known as the Madagascar croton, is a shrub native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to red and yellow. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiny capsules containing seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
