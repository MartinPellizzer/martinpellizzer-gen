    "intro": "Coronilla sericea, commonly known as silky coronilla, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its trifoliate leaves and ability to fix nitrogen make it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects. It is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
