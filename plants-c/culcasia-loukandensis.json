    "intro": "Culcasia loukandensis, commonly known as the African giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of water bodies, and it plays a role in providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Culcasia loukandensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal in water gardens and ponds."
