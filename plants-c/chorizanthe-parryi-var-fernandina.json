    "intro": "Chorizanthe parryi var. fernandina, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant produces dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The species is well-known for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
