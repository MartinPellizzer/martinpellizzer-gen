    "intro": "Cuscuta compacta var. adpressa, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is typically found growing on the stems of other plants, such as grasses and shrubs. It is native to North America and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its life cycle is short, with rapid growth and reproduction through seeds."
