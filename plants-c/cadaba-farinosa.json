    "intro": "Cadaba farinosa, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine white hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Its succulent-like leaves store water, making it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
