    "intro": "Caryomene foveolata, commonly known as the foveolata caryomene, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant's leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its native habitat. Caryomene foveolata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
