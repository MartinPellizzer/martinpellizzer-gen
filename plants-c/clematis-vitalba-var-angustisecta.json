    "intro": "Clematis vitalba var. angustisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf honeysuckle, is a climbing vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, twining stems and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and divided. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening, though it can be invasive in some regions. The fruit is a small, dark blue berry that ripens in late summer."
