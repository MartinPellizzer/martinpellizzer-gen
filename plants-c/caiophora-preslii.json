    "intro": "Caiophora preslii, commonly known as the Preslii's ghost plant, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, where it thrives in cool, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Its flowers are small, tubular, and typically pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Caiophora preslii is considered a conservation concern."
