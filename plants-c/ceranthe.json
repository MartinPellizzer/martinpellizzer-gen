    "intro": "Ceranthe, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a short, unbranched stem and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to environmental changes, Ceranthe is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
