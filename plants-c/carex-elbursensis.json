    "intro": "Carex elbursensis, commonly known as the Elburz sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Elburz Mountains in Iran. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or subalpine habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-ranked spikelets, which are wind-pollinated. Carex elbursensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to high-altitude conditions."
