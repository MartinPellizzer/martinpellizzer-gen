    "intro": "Chenopodium album f. heterophyllum, commonly known as red goosefoot, is a variant of the common goosefoot characterized by its distinct red pigmentation in the leaves and stems. It is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family, native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in temperate climates. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and have a rough texture due to the presence of small, sand-like crystals called phylloclades. The inflorescence consists of small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, terminal spikes."
