    "intro": "Cervaria latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf cervaria, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Cupuliferae and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive, cup-like structures called cupules, which enclose its seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
