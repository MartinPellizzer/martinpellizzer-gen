    "intro": "Clethra tinifolia, commonly known as the smallleaf clethra, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and seasonal interest, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Clethra tinifolia is also valued for its ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils and its role in supporting local wildlife."
