    "intro": "Clematis flammula var. caespitosa, commonly known as the creeping clematis, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats or cushions, often found in rocky or shaded areas. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The variety caespitosa is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to other forms of Clematis flammula."
