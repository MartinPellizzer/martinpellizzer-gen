    "intro": "Cladocolea molotensis, commonly known as the Molotensk cliffbriar, is a rare shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and woody stems that are covered in dense, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
