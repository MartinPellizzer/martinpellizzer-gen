    "intro": "Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus subsp. puberulus, commonly known as the stickyflower goldenbush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, often glandular foliage that gives it a sticky texture. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with fine, soft hairs, contributing to its pubescent appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
