    "intro": "Copiapoa marginata, commonly known as the \"Coppens\" or \"Coppens cactus,\" is a species of cactus native to Chile. It is a columnar cactus with a distinct rib structure and spines that are typically white or yellow. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are clustered at the top of the stems. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Copiapoa marginata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
