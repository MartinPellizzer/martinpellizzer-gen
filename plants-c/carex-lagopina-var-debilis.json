    "intro": "Carex lagopina var. debilis, commonly known as slender sedge, is a low-growing perennial herb native to moist, temperate regions. It typically forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, arranged in spikelets that are usually found in clusters. It thrives in wet or damp soils, making it a common sight in marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. This variety is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wildlife."
