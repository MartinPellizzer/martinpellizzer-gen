    "intro": "Convolvulus fugacissimus, commonly known as the transient bindweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are usually pale yellow or white, blooming from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are sprawling and often twining. The species is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it endure drought conditions."
