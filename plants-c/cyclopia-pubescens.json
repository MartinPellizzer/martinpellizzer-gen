    "intro": "Cyclopia pubescens, commonly known as the Cape sugarbush, is a shrub native to the fynbos biome of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is drought-resistant, making it well-suited to the Mediterranean climate of its native region. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Cyclopia pubescens plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is also valued for its medicinal properties."
