    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 antigone, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is a hybrid between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium formosanum, resulting in a plant with unique floral characteristics. The flowers are large, showy, and typically have a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a defining feature of the genus Cypripedium. The plant prefers cool, humid environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and protected in its natural habitat."
