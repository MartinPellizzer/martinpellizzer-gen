    "intro": "Cenchrus pedicellatus, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often pink to reddish in color. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is typically found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It is adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in poor soil environments. Cenchrus pedicellatus is often used in erosion control due to its rapid growth and hardy nature."
