    "intro": "Centaurea jacea subsp. banatica, commonly known as the Banat centaury, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pink to purple, with ray florets that are longer than the tubular central florets. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the main species, including variations in leaf shape and flower structure."
