    "intro": "Convolvulus arvensis var. minor, commonly known as lesser field bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rapid growth and extensive root system make it an aggressive weed in agricultural and natural habitats. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be challenging to control due to its persistent nature."
