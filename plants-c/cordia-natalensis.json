    "intro": "Cordia natalensis, commonly known as Natal whiteheart, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by oblong, woody capsules that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in coastal and inland forests. Cordia natalensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine."
