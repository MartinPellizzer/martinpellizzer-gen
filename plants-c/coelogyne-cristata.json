It is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers that bloom in clusters along the stem. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically elongated and strap-like, and it thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light. Coelogyne cristata is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
