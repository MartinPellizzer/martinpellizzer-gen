    "intro": "Cochlearia tatrae, commonly known as the Tatra bellflower, is a rare alpine plant native to the Tatra Mountains in Central Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats at high altitudes, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems are usually unbranched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cochlearia tatrae is considered a vulnerable species."
