    "intro": "Corymbia cadophora subsp. pliantha, commonly known as the red gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin, flaky strips. The leaves are lance-shaped, glossy green on top, and grey-green underneath, with a distinctive waxy coating. It produces small, pale pink to red flowers in clusters, which are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. The tree is adapted to seasonal rainfall patterns and can tolerate drought once established."
