It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that appear in umbel-like clusters, giving it its scientific name. The plant has feathery, bipinnate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its flowers are rich in nectar, making it an important source of food for bees and other pollinators. Cassia umbellata thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
