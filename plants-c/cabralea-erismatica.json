    "intro": "Cabralea erismatica, commonly known as the erismatic cabralea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a slightly hairy texture, while the fruit is a small capsule containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
