    "intro": "Calyptroon, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Nymphaeaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on water surfaces. The plant has a unique structure with a spathaceous calyx that protects the flower before it opens. Its leaves are broad and floating, while its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water. Calyptroon plays a significant role in both ecological systems and cultural symbolism in many Asian societies."
