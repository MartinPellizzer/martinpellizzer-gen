    "intro": "Candollea pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant features intricate fronds with a finely divided structure, often displaying a bluish-green hue. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish. Due to its small size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
