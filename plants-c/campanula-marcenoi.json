    "intro": "Campanula marcenoi, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Campanula marcenoi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and hardiness."
