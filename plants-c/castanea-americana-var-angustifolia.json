    "intro": "Castanea americana var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chestnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically 4\u20138 inches long and have a serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of spiny, burr-like fruits that contain one or two edible nuts. Its flowers are small, inconspicuous, and typically appear in early spring before the leaves. This variety is closely related to the American chestnut but is smaller in size and has a more limited range."
