    "intro": "Cousinia lyrata, commonly known as the musical bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing delicate, fragrant blossoms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette, while its stems are often hairy and covered in fine pubescence. Cousinia lyrata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats."
