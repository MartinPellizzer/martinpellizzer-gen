    "intro": "Clinopodium \u00d7 mixtum, commonly known as hybrid mint or hybrid oregano, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Clinopodium vulgare and Clinopodium scoticum. It is a perennial herb characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed areas. Clinopodium \u00d7 mixtum is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, similar to its parent species."
