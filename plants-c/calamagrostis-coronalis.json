    "intro": "Calamagrostis coronalis, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a tall, ornamental grass native to the moist, acidic soils of northern Europe. It features slender, arching blades that range from blue-green to purple in color, with a striking silver-white inflorescence that appears in late summer. This plant is often used in garden landscapes for its elegant appearance and ability to thrive in wet or boggy conditions. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively low maintenance once established. Calamagrostis coronalis is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
