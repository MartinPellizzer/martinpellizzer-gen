    "intro": "Crepis virens, commonly known as the green oatgrass, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, three-lobed achene, which is a common feature among the genus Crepis. Crepis virens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
