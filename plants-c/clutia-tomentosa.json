    "intro": "Clutia tomentosa, commonly known as wooly clutia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in racemes and bloom during the wet season. Clutia tomentosa is often found in moist, shaded areas and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
