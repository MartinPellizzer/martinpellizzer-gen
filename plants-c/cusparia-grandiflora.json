    "intro": "Cusparia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered cusparia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
