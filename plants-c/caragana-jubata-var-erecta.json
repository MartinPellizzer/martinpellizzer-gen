    "intro": "Caragana jubata var. erecta, commonly known as the upright shrub legume, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and compound leaves composed of multiple small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, followed by small, woody pods that contain several seeds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, contributing to its ecological importance in its native habitat."
