It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or pink flowers that resemble candles, hence its common name. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which help in reducing water loss in arid environments. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. Cuphea elegans is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant blooms and drought tolerance."
