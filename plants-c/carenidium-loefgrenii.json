It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, showcasing its adaptation to harsh conditions. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps reduce water loss, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
