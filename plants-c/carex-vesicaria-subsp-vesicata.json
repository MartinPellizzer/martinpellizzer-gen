It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and stream sides. Its flowering stems bear tiny, three-lobed flowers that are often greenish or brownish in color. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
