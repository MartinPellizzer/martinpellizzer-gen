    "intro": "Calamus macropterus, commonly known as the giant reed or broad-leaved calamus, is a member of the Arecaceae family. It is a tall, slender perennial plant that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often ribbed and have a waxy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stem. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic oils. Calamus macropterus is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found in wetlands and marshy areas."
