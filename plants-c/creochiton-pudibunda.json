    "intro": "Creochiton pudibunda, commonly known as the shy sea snail, is a species of sea snail in the family Crepidulidae. It is characterized by its elongated, spiral-shaped shell that is typically light-colored with a smooth surface. This species is primarily found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocks or other substrates. The shell provides protection against predators and environmental stressors. Its diet mainly consists of algae and detritus, which it scrapes from surfaces using its radula."
