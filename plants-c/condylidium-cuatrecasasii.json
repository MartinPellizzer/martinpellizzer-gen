    "intro": "Condylidium cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cauca orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, showy inflorescences that bear intricate, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. Its botanical features include lanceolate leaves and a short, stout rhizome, which are adaptations to its specialized habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
