It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces bulbous underground stems, which are essential for its propagation and survival. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and often arranged in a fan shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Crinum parvibulbosum thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
