It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that contain seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
