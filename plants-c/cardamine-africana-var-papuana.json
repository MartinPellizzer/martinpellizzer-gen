    "intro": "Cardamine africana var. papuana, commonly known as the Papuan watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water, aiding in its aquatic adaptation. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom during the wet season. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to that of watercress."
