    "intro": "Corallocarpus glomeruliflorus, commonly known as the clustered-flowered corallocarpus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important species. The plant is characterized by its dense, clustered inflorescences that bear small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth surface and prominent veins. While it is not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and potential ecological roles in its native habitat."
