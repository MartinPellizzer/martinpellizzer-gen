    "intro": "Cyclosorus doodioides, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Cyclosorus doodioides plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
