    "intro": "Campanula persicifolia var. latisepala, commonly known as the broad-sepaled bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, often with a white throat. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom reliably in cooler climates."
