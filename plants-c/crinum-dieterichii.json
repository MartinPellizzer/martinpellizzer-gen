    "intro": "Crinum dieterichii, commonly known as the Dieterich's crinum, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces large, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a strong, sweet fragrance. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, forming a dense rosette at the base. Crinum dieterichii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
