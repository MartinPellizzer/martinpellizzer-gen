    "intro": "Convallaria majalis subf. picta, commonly known as the spotted lily or painted lily, is a striking variant of the traditional lily species. It is characterized by its distinctive spotted or mottled leaves, which give it a unique visual appearance. This subform is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland environments. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers with a sweet fragrance, typically blooming in early spring. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation, though it requires well-drained soil and partial shade to thrive."
