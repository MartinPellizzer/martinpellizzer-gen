    "intro": "Carex euxina, commonly known as the red-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in wetlands. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex euxina plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
