    "intro": "Cereus latifrons, commonly known as the broad-leaved cactus, is a species native to the Canary Islands. It is a tall, columnar cactus with thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, a characteristic feature of many cacti in the Cactaceae family. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Cereus latifrons is often cultivated for its striking appearance and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
