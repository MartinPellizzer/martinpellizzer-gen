    "intro": "Cousinia dolicholepis, commonly known as the longstem cushion flower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, low-growing mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Cousinia dolicholepis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
