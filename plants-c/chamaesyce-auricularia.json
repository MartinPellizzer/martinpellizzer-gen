    "intro": "Chamaesyce auricularia, commonly known as the earleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often shaped like ears, giving it its common name, and it is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Chamaesyce auricularia is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
