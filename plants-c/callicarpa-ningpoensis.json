    "intro": "Callicarpa ningpoensis, commonly known as the Ningpo beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its clusters of small, red berries that ripen in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, appearing in the spring before the leaves fully emerge. The berries are edible for birds and sometimes humans, though they are often described as having a tart, slightly sweet flavor."
