    "intro": "Cyrtogonium serratifolium, commonly known as the serrated leaf fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It features fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely serrated margins that give it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist substrates such as tree trunks or rocks. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds."
