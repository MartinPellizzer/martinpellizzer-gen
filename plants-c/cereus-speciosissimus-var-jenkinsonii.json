    "intro": "Cereus speciosissimus var. jenkinsonii, commonly known as the Jenkinson's night bloomer, is a cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and spiny, ribbed structure adapted to withstand extreme drought. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet fragrance, typically opening only after sunset. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well-suited for desert environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique flowering behavior."
