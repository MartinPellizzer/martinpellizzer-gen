    "intro": "Chloris polydactyla f. pauciradiata, commonly known as the sparse-rayed grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale blue to purple flowers. The plant is characterized by its reduced inflorescence structure, with fewer branches compared to the typical form of Chloris polydactyla. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
