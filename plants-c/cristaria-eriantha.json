    "intro": "Cristaria eriantha, commonly known as the woolly marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like stems and clusters of small, pale green to white flowers. The plant produces distinctive, fluffy seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, woolly appearance. Cristaria eriantha thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks."
