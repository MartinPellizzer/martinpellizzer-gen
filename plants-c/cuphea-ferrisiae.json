    "intro": "Cuphea ferrisiae, commonly known as the flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower. Cuphea ferrisiae is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a hardy choice for tropical and subtropical regions."
