    "intro": "Cybianthus coriaceus, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops. Cybianthus coriaceus is an important plant for local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal in coastal gardens."
