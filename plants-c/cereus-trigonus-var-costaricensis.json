It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems and clusters of white, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, thriving in full sun conditions. Its flowers open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. This variety is relatively cold-hardy, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates with proper drainage."
