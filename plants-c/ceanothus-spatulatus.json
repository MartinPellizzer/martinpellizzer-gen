    "intro": "Ceanothus spatulatus, commonly known as the broadleaf ceanothus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of thick, leathery leaves with a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces showy clusters of blue or purple flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Ceanothus spatulatus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate drought conditions."
