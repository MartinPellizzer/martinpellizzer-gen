It features pinnately compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces bright yellow, raceme-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in warm climates. Its flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The seeds are encased in elongated pods and can be used in traditional medicine or as a spice."
