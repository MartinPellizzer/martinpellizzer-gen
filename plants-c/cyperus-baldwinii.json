    "intro": "Cyperus baldwinii, commonly known as Baldwin's flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas. Its flowering spikes are usually small and inconspicuous, with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Cyperus baldwinii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
