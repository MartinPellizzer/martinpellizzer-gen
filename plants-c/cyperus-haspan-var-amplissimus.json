    "intro": "Cyperus haspan var. amplissimus, commonly known as the broadleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, thriving in shallow water or saturated soil. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-ranked spikelets, which are often subtended by bracts. Cyperus haspan var. amplissimus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
