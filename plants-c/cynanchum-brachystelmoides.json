    "intro": "Cynanchum brachystelmoides, commonly known as the short-stemmed dogbane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of East Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its milky sap and opposite leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicles that contain seeds with tufts for wind dispersal. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
