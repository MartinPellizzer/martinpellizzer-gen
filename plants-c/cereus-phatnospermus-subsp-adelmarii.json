    "intro": "Cereus phatnospermus subsp. adelmarii, commonly known as the Adelmarii Cereus, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a common trait among many species in the Cereus genus. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. This subspecies is relatively hardy and can tolerate drought conditions, making it a popular choice for xerophytic gardens."
