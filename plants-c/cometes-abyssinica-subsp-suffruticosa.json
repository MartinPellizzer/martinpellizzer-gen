It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, narrow leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude regions with cool, moist conditions. It is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it adapts to poor soil conditions. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for ecological and horticultural study."
