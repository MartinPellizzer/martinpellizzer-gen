    "intro": "Cercis canadensis, commonly known as the eastern redbud, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. The plant produces small, flat, brown pods that contain three to four seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Cercis canadensis thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
