    "intro": "Chionachne sclerachne, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it withstand harsh cold climates. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize rocky or barren ground. Chionachne sclerachne plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
