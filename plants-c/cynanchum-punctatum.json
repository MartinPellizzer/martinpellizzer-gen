    "intro": "Cynanchum punctatum, commonly known as the punctate milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist woodlands and along stream banks, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and its flowers are pale green to yellowish, arranged in umbels. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant is also a host species for certain butterfly larvae, playing an important role in local ecosystems."
