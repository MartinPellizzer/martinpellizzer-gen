It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Cyperus montanus produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
