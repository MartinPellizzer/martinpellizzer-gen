    "intro": "Carex acuta subvar. graciliflora, commonly known as slender-flowered narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, three-ranked flowers, and it produces three-sided, three-angled seeds. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
