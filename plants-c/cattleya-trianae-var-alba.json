    "intro": "Cattleya trianae var. alba, commonly known as the White Cattleya, is a striking orchid native to the Andes mountains of South America. This variant is distinguished by its pure white petals and a pale yellow lip, which set it apart from other Cattleya species. It typically blooms in late winter to early spring, producing fragrant flowers that attract pollinators. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil, and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its rarity and beauty make it a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts."
