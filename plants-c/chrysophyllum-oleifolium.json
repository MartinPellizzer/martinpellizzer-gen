    "intro": "Chrysophyllum oleifolium, commonly known as the African butterfruit or yellow custard apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to western Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, yellowish-white flowers. The fruit is typically pear-shaped, with a smooth, waxy skin that turns from green to yellow as it ripens. The plant is valued for its edible fruit, which has a sweet, creamy pulp and is often used in local cuisines. It also has ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and is sometimes cultivated for its timber."
