    "intro": "Calamus angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved calamus, is a member of the Aroid family (Araceae). It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in wet, marshy environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Calamus angustifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
