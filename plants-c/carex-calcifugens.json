    "intro": "Carex calcifugens, commonly known as the limestone sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to rocky, calcareous soils in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like flower clusters. The plant is adapted to grow in dry, alkaline environments, often found in crevices and on slopes. Its ability to thrive in calcium-rich soils makes it a valuable indicator species for limestone habitats. Carex calcifugens typically blooms in early spring, producing small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated."
