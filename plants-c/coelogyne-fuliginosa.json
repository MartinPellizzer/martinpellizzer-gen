    "intro": "Coelogyne fuliginosa, commonly known as the sooty orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a rhizomatous structure with fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, soot-like coating. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming during the dry season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its natural habitat with limited rainfall. Coelogyne fuliginosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and unique appearance."
