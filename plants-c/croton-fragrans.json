It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful foliage, which often displays shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Croton fragrans is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and air-purifying properties."
