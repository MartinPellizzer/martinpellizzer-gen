    "intro": "Coryphantha asterias, commonly known as the starry hedgehog cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in bright yellow spines and clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds dispersed by animals. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to arid environments. Coryphantha asterias plays a role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife in its native habitat."
