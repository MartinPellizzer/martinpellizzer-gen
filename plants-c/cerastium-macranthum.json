    "intro": "Cerastium macranthum, commonly known as the greater mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a mat-forming growth habit, often carpeting the ground in moist, shaded areas. It thrives in woodland and meadow environments, preferring well-drained soil. Cerastium macranthum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in garden settings."
