It belongs to the Commelinaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-colored bracts that resemble those of the arum family. The plant features a short, stocky stem with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. Its flowers are small and clustered in a spadix, surrounded by the showy bracts. Commelina critica is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands."
