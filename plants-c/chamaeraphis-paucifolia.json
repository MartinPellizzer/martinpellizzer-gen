It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are usually borne on short pedicels. It thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Chamaeraphis paucifolia is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including high salinity and strong winds."
