    "intro": "Ctenitis coriacea, commonly known as the rough shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are covered in a dense layer of small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often on rocks or tree trunks. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually divided into lance-shaped segments, giving the plant a distinctive, rugged appearance."
