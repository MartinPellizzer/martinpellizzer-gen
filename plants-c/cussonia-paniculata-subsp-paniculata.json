It is a shrub or small tree with slender, bamboo-like stems that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers followed by bright red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Its rhizomes are used as a starch source and have a texture similar to arrowroot."
