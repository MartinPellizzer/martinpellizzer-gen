    "intro": "Cheilanthes tinaei, commonly known as the Texas rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in crevices and retain moisture. Cheilanthes tinaei is often found growing on limestone or sandstone, making it a common sight in desert and semi-arid regions."
