    "intro": "Cyrtandra \u00d7 epiphytica, commonly known as the hybrid Cyrtandra, is a flowering plant in the Gesneriaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Cyrtandra pedata and Cyrtandra hirsuta, both native to tropical regions of the Pacific. This plant is typically epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It features showy, tubular flowers that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The hybrid is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to cultivated environments."
