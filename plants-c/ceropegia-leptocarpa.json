It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and tuberous roots. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often white or pink in color, which attract specific pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant."
