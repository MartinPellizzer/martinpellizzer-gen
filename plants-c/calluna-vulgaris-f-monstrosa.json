    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris f. monstrosa, commonly known as the giant heather, is a variant of the common heather characterized by its enlarged, showy flowers. This form exhibits a more vigorous growth habit compared to typical Calluna vulgaris, with larger, more clustered blooms that can reach up to 5 cm in diameter. The plant is typically found in acidic, well-drained soils in heathlands and moorlands. It produces vibrant pink to purple flowers in late summer, adding visual interest to its natural habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific conditions to thrive."
