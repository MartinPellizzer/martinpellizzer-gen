    "intro": "Callipteris esculenta, commonly known as the edible fern, is a species of fern native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that unfurl gradually. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its fronds are not only ornamental but also have culinary uses in traditional cuisines. However, it is important to note that not all parts of the plant are edible, and proper identification is crucial to avoid toxic species."
