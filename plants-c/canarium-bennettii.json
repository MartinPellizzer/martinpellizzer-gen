    "intro": "Canarium bennettii, commonly known as the white beach almond, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, whitish bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, almond-like fruits that are encased in a hard, woody shell. The fruit contains a single seed, which is often used in traditional medicine and as a food source. Canarium bennettii is also valued for its timber, which is durable and used in construction and furniture-making."
