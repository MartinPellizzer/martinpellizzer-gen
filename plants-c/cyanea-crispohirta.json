    "intro": "Cyanea crispohirta, commonly known as the Hawaiian sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the island of Oahu in Hawaii. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. The plant features showy, violet to blue flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in the hot, dry conditions. Cyanea crispohirta is also known for its ability to thrive in sandy soils and is an important part of the local ecosystem."
