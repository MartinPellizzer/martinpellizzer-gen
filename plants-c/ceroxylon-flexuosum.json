    "intro": "Ceroxylon flexuosum, commonly known as the Andean wax palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its long, drooping leaves that form a dense canopy, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions."
