    "intro": "Carex dioica, commonly known as the common sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves, which are typically arranged in a tight, cylindrical cluster. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are grouped into spikelets, with separate male and female flowers on different plants, making it dioecious. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Carex dioica plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
