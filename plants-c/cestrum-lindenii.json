    "intro": "Cestrum lindenii, commonly known as the night-blooming coffee plant, is a flowering shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that open at night and emit a strong, coffee-like scent. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a slightly hairy texture. Cestrum lindenii thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
