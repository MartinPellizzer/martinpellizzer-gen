    "intro": "Croton kroneanus, commonly known as the red croton, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, palmate leaves that range in color from green to reddish-brown, depending on the season and light exposure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by orange or red berries, adding to its visual appeal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its striking foliage, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in outdoor gardens in suitable climates."
