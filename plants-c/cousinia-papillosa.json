    "intro": "Cousinia papillosa, commonly known as the silky cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Cousinia papillosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
