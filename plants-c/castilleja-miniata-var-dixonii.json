    "intro": "Castilleja miniata var. dixonii, commonly known as the Dixon's Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking red, orange, or yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, often hairy stems and produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually clustered at the base. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe, and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
