    "intro": "Cirsium arenesii, commonly known as the sand thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cirsium arenesii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and provides nectar for pollinators."
