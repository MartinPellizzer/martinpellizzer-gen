    "intro": "Cyclosorus hamiferus, commonly known as the common cyclosorus, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Peltigeraceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on decaying wood or soil. The plant has a thallus that is usually flat or slightly curled, with a distinct central axis and lateral lobes. It reproduces through spores, which are released from cup-shaped structures called soridia. Cyclosorus hamiferus is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and moisture levels in its habitat."
