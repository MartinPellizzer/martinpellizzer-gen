    "intro": "Chrysosplenium dubium, commonly known as the yellow mossy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, often clustered in tight inflorescences. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in its rocky, alpine habitat. Chrysosplenium dubium is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks."
