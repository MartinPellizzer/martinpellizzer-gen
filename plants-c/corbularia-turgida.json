    "intro": "Corbularia turgida, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has broad, waxy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern on the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, while its leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Corbularia turgida is often found in slow-moving or still freshwater environments."
