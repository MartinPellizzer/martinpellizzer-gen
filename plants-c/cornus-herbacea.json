It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red or yellow berries that are edible for birds and small mammals. Cornus herbacea typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage turns vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall, adding ornamental value to its habitat."
