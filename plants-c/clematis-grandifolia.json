    "intro": "Clematis grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It features climbing stems with stout, ridged, and hairy nodes, allowing it to ascend supports with ease. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and trifoliate, with three leaflets that are ovate to elliptic in shape. Clematis grandifolia thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
