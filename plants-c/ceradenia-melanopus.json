    "intro": "Ceradenia melanopus, commonly known as the black-barked orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of South America, particularly in countries like Colombia and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its dark, almost black, bark and its elegant, pale green to white flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicately endangered species."
