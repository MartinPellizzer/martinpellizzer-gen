    "intro": "Cassia granulata, commonly known as the Indian flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a rough, granular texture. The plant produces bright yellow, clustered flowers that bloom in summer, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing flat, winged seeds. Cassia granulata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a resilient plant in diverse environments."
