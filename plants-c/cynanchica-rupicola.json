    "intro": "Cynanchica rupicola, commonly known as the rock milkvetch, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss. It is often found growing on rocky slopes and in dry grasslands. Cynanchica rupicola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
