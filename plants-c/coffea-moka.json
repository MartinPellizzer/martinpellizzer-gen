    "intro": "Coffea moka, commonly known as the Mocha coffee plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to eastern Africa, particularly Ethiopia, and thrives in high-altitude regions with a tropical climate. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds used for coffee production. These seeds, or beans, are harvested, processed, and roasted to develop the characteristic aroma and flavor of Mocha coffee. Coffea moka is valued for its rich, chocolatey taste and is a key variety in the global coffee industry."
