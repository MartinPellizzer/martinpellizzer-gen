    "intro": "Cyanea macrostegia var. parvibracteata, commonly known as the Hawaiian coral tree, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small shrub or tree that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
