    "intro": "Caroxylon stenopterum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved caroxylon, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Myrtaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often accompanied by a faint aromatic scent. It is native to specific regions in Australia, where it thrives in dry, sandy soils. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
