    "intro": "Centaurea sphaerocephala var. polyacantha, commonly known as the clustered knapweed, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust root system and upright, branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces dense, spherical flower heads composed of numerous small, bright yellow to orange-red flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a grayish or blue-green hue due to the presence of fine trichomes. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is often found in dry, rocky soils."
