    "intro": "Carduus ciliatus, commonly known as the silky thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, lobed, silvery-green leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves and stems are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Carduus ciliatus is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows and disturbed areas."
