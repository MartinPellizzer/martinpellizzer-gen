    "intro": "Caesalpinia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty crown or red crown, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves and striking orange-red to yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces long, flat pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Caesalpinia ferruginea is adapted to sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
