    "intro": "Coffea vianneyi, commonly known as the Vianney's coffee, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of western Africa, particularly in countries like Cameroon and Gabon. This plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The fruit, which is similar to other coffee species, contains seeds that are used for producing coffee beans, though it is not widely cultivated. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coffea vianneyi remains a subject of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts."
