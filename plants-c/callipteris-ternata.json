    "intro": "Callipteris ternata, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States and parts of the Caribbean, typically growing in sandy or coastal soils. The plant is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often gray-green in color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer, which are clustered in panicles. Callipteris ternata is well adapted to salt spray and is often found in dune ecosystems, contributing to coastal stabilization."
