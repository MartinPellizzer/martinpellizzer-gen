    "intro": "Cyperus kasamensis, commonly known as the Kasam flatsedge, is a species of sedge native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and seasonally flooded areas. It has a fibrous root system and produces spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Cyperus kasamensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
