    "intro": "Cyathocalyx magnificus, commonly known as the grand cupular vine, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its elaborate, cup-shaped inflorescences. The plant features showy, often brightly colored flowers that are clustered in a unique, umbrella-like structure called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and covered in a waxy cuticle that helps retain moisture in its native humid environment. The vine produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible and contain seeds enclosed in a gelatinous coating. Cyathocalyx magnificus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia."
