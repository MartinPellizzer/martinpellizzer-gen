    "intro": "Coelogyne parvula var. strictiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed coelogyne, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often a deep green. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with prominent red or orange lip petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and resilience."
