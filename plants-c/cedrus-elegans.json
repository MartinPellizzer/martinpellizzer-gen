    "intro": "Cedrus elegans, commonly known as the Lebanon cedar, is a coniferous tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, pyramidal crown. The tree has scale-like leaves that are tightly packed along the branches, and it produces cone-like structures that contain its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, temperate climate. Cedrus elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in ancient architecture and religious symbolism."
