    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 bifrons var. montanoformis, commonly known as the mountain thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, thriving in alpine and subalpine environments. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
