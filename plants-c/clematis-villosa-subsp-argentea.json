It features slender, twining stems that can grow up to 15 feet in length, often covered in fine, silvery-white hairs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of white to pale blue. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. This species thrives in partial shade to full sun and is well-suited for trellises or as a ground cover in woodland gardens."
