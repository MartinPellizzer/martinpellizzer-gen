    "intro": "Cynanchum humile, commonly known as the small milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to regions of Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which is known for its milkweed-like characteristics. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, and it produces small, elongated fruits that contain toxic seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by herbivores and is not commonly used in traditional medicine."
