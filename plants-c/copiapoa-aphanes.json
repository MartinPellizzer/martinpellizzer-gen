It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered with a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to the arid environment. Copiapoa aphanes is a slow-growing species that thrives in full sun and requires minimal water."
