    "intro": "Carex lupulina var. longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-stemmed bulrush, is a perennial sedge characterized by its grass-like leaves and cylindrical flower clusters. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often reddish or brownish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil. This variety is notable for its ecological role in providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
