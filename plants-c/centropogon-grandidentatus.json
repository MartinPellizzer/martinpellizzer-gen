    "intro": "Centropogon grandidentatus, commonly known as the broad-toothed grass. It is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, often with a distinctive appearance due to the broad, tooth-like lobes on the bracts. Centropogon grandidentatus is often found in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges."
