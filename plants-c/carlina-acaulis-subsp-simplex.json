    "intro": "Carlina acaulis subsp. simplex, commonly known as the simple cudweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a single terminal head, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as cliffs and slopes. Due to its compact form and ornamental flowers, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
