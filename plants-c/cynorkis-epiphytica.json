    "intro": "Cynorkis epiphytica, commonly known as the tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a tall, unbranched trunk covered in a dense layer of roots, which helps it anchor to its host. Its fronds are large, feather-like, and can reach several meters in length, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Cynorkis epiphytica thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
