    "intro": "Conopodium capnoides, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. Conopodium capnoides is an important component of aquatic ecosystems, contributing to the food web through both its predatory structures and its role as a habitat for microorganisms."
