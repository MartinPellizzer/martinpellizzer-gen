    "intro": "Crypteronia paniculata var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy crypteronia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. The leaves are elliptical, with a rough texture and a pubescent surface, giving the plant its common name. It produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom during the warmer months. The plant is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, often found in areas with high salinity and strong winds."
