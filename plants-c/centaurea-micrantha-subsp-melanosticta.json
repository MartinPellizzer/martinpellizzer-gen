    "intro": "Centaurea micrantha subsp. melanosticta, commonly known as the dark-stained centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and sunny habitats. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical heads, which are characteristic of the Centaurea genus. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight hairy texture. The subspecies is distinguished by its darker, more contrasting markings on the flower heads compared to other Centaurea species."
