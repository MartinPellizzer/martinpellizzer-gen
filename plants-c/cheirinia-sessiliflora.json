It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native region."
