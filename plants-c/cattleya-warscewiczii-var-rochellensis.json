It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. The plant is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its beauty in botanical gardens and private collections. Due to its limited natural habitat and conservation status, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
