It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bright red or orange tubular flowers. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. Its unique floral structure attracts specific pollinators, contributing to its ecological role in its native environment."
