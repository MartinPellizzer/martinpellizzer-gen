    "intro": "Capsella integrella, commonly known as the common mouse-ear or mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in gardens. Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily. Capsella integrella is an annual plant that completes its life cycle within a single growing season."
