    "intro": "Cyperus esculentus var. sprucei, commonly known as swamp arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features slender, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters, often forming a rosette at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its roots are fibrous and can be harvested for use in traditional medicine or as a vegetable in some cultures. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
