It is characterized by its tall, erect pseudobulbs and long, arching inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms during the winter months, hence its common name. Its leaves are broad, strap-shaped, and arranged in two rows along the stem. Cymbidium floridum is a popular ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
