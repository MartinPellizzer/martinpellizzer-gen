It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, closely packed leaves. The plant produces sporophytes with a distinctive, inflated capsule that releases spores. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ecological preferences make it an important indicator species in certain habitats."
