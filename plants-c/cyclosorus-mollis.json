    "intro": "Cyclosorus mollis, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that form a rosette shape, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often submerged, followed by the development of tiny, bladder-like fruits. Cyclosorus mollis is typically found in ponds, ditches, and other shallow water habitats where it plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients. Its delicate structure and rapid growth make it both a valuable and sometimes invasive species in aquatic ecosystems."
