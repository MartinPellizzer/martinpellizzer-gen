    "intro": "Caralluma lutea subsp. vansonii, commonly known as the yellow nightshade, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically reduced to small spines, reducing water loss through transpiration. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
