    "intro": "Cardamine integra, commonly known as the broad-leaved watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of kidney-shaped, hairy leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its leaves are often used in salads and have a peppery, spicy flavor similar to watercress. Botanically, it belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes other cruciferous plants."
