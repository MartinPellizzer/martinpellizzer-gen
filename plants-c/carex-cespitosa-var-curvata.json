    "intro": "Carex cespitosa var. curvata, commonly known as the curled sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
