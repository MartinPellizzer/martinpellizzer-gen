    "intro": "Conopodium bourgaei f. parvulum, commonly known as the dwarf bladder fern, is a compact, low-growing fern native to the southeastern United States. It features small, round, spore-bearing structures called sorocarps, which are typically clustered in dense groups on the stems. The fronds are typically short and creeping, with a distinctive bladdery appearance due to the presence of specialized air-filled cells. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
