    "intro": "Comarostaphylis rupestris, commonly known as the rock hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows on rocky slopes and coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Comarostaphylis rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
