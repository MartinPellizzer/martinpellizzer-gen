    "intro": "Carex stricta var. elatior, commonly known as tall sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly rough to the touch. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a common sight in wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for various wildlife species."
