    "intro": "Carex clavaudiana, commonly known as the Clavaud's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of many sedge species. Carex clavaudiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
