    "intro": "Chionochloa flavescens subsp. brevis, commonly known as the short-stemmed alpine grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Southern Hemisphere, particularly found in New Zealand. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery or pale green coating. This subspecies thrives in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it forms dense mats. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine invertebrates."
