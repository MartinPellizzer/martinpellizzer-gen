    "intro": "Crucianella kurdistanica, commonly known as the Kurdish sea bean, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Kurdistan. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is known for its unique seed pods that split open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
