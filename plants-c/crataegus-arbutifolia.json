    "intro": "Crataegus arbutifolia, commonly known as the rosehip bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits called rosehips in the fall, which are rich in vitamin C. Its leaves are typically oval with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Crataegus arbutifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
