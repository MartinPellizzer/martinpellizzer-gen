    "intro": "Carex echinata var. angustata, commonly known as narrow-leaved bulblet sedge, is a perennial plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
