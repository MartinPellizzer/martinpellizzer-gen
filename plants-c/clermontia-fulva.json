    "intro": "Clermontia fulva, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow petals and a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often near streams or in rocky areas. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Clermontia fulva is considered a rare and endangered species."
