    "intro": "Cardamine tenuifolia f. communis, commonly known as narrow-leaved watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. The plant features trifoliate leaves with finely toothed margins, and small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in suitable habitats. The species is valued for its peppery flavor and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
