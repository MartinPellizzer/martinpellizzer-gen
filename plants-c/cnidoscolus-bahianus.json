It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible tubers that are rich in starch. Its leaves are also used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its nutritional value."
