It is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow or white flowers and its ability to thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often found growing on cliffs, dunes, and coastal grasslands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils."
