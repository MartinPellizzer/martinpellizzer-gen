    "intro": "Cleistocactus sepium var. ventimigliae, commonly known as the Ventimiglia's ghost cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of northern Argentina. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, often adorned with spines and a unique, ghost-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically hidden within the stem, a feature typical of the cleistocactus genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
