    "intro": "Capparis duchesnei var. sapinii, commonly known as the Alpine caper, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its woody stems, aromatic leaves, and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, tangy berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to grow in harsh alpine conditions."
