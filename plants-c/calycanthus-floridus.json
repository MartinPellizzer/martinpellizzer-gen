    "intro": "Calycanthus floridus, commonly known as the sweetshrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fragrant, reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, elliptical leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy blooms. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Calycanthus floridus is valued in gardens for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
