    "intro": "Crataegus arcana, commonly known as the white thornapple or white hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, thorny branches and clusters of white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are typically oval with serrated edges and turn yellow in autumn. Crataegus arcana is often found in moist woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
