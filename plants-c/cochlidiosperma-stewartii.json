It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a velvety texture. Cochlidiosperma stewartii is primarily of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
