    "intro": "Cryptanthus bivittatus, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a member of the amaranth family (Amaranthaceae). It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and striking rosette of fleshy, grass-like leaves. The leaves are typically dark green with distinctive white or silver markings, resembling a zebra's stripes. It produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple during the growing season. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
