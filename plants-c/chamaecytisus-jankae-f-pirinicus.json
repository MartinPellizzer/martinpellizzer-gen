    "intro": "Chamaecytisus jankae f. pirinicus, commonly known as the Pirin rock rose, is a shrub native to the Balkan region, particularly found in the Pirin Mountains of Bulgaria. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to sunny, alpine environments. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in challenging landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
