    "intro": "Cerastium porphyrii, commonly known as the purple willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its leaves are oval-shaped, hairy, and have a slightly succulent texture, while its stems are prostrate and often root at the nodes. Cerastium porphyrii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded or partially shaded conditions."
