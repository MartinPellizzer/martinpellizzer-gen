    "intro": "Cynanchum nitidum, commonly known as the glossy milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is known for its milky sap, which contains latex. Cynanchum nitidum is often found in moist or wet environments such as marshes and stream banks. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
