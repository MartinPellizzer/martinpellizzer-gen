    "intro": "Ctenitis contigua, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, acidic soils. The fronds are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, feather-like appearance. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. This plant is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and along stream banks."
