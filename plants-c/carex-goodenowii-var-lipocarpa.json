It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, strap-shaped leaves that have a waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
