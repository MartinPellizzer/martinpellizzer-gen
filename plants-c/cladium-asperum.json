    "intro": "Cladium asperum, commonly known as the rough sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, stiff, and often hairy leaf blades that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters at the base of the leaves, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands in marshy areas. Cladium asperum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
