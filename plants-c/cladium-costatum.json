    "intro": "Cladium costatum, commonly known as the marsh hibiscus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in the southeastern United States. It features tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish or purple hue. The plant produces showy, hibiscus-like flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink or red, which bloom from summer to fall. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy texture, adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. Cladium costatum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland wildlife species."
