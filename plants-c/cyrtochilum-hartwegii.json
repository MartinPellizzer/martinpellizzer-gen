    "intro": "Cyrtochilum hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's slipper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, preferring cool and humid conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the rocky substrate, and it has a short flowering period. Cyrtochilum hartwegii is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
