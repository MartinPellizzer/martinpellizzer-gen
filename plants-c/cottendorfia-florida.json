    "intro": "Cottendorfia florida, commonly known as the Florida cottendorfia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the edges of swamps and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
