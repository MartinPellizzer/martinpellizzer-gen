    "intro": "Crepis eritreensis, commonly known as Eritrean hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to the highlands of Eritrea and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces yellow ray flowers surrounded by a series of yellow disk flowers, typical of the genus Crepis. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat."
