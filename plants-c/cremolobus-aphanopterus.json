    "intro": "Cremolobus aphanopterus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of visible leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its specialized aerial roots that absorb nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the canopy of dense forests. Due to its habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species from habitat destruction and climate change."
