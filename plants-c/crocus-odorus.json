    "intro": "Crocus odorus, commonly known as the sweet violet, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from violet to purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, round bulbs that store nutrients for the next growing season. Its flowers are known for their strong, sweet scent, which attracts pollinators such as bees and moths. The plant is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and historical use in perfumery."
