    "intro": "Castilleja franciscana, commonly known as Franciscan paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to California. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, crimson-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and chaparral. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
