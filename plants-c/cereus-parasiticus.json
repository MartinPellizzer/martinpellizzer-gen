    "intro": "Cereus parasiticus, commonly known as the parasitic night-blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from its host plant while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has a tall, spiny stem and produces large, showy white flowers that open at night. Its flowers emit a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming behavior."
