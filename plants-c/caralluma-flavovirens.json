    "intro": "Caralluma flavovirens, commonly known as the yellow-green devil's tongue, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its succulent, spine-tipped stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, further reducing water loss. Caralluma flavovirens is also noted for its ability to survive extreme temperatures and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
