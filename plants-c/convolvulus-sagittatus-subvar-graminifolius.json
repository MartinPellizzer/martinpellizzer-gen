    "intro": "Convolvulus sagittatus subvar. graminifolius, commonly known as the slender arrowhead bindweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The flowers are small, funnel-shaped, and usually pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky areas or along roadsides. It is a perennial species that spreads through both seeds and rhizomes, making it somewhat invasive in certain environments."
