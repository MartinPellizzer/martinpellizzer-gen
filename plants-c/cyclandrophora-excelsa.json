    "intro": "Cyclandrophora excelsa, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a large aquatic plant native to the Amazon basin. It features broad, floating leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing shade and habitat for aquatic life. The plant has a thick, spongy stem that supports its massive leaves and helps it float. Its flowers are typically white or pink, opening in the early morning and closing by midday. Cyclandrophora excelsa plays an important role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its native wetland ecosystems."
