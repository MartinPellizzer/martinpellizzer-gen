    "intro": "Cyathea moniliformis, commonly known as the bearded tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a fibrous, cork-like covering on its trunk, which gives it a rugged texture. Its fronds are typically arranged in a rosette pattern and can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea moniliformis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
