    "intro": "Chenopodium glaucum subsp. salinum, commonly known as saltbush, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas and salt-affected soils due to its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations. The plant has small, often hairy leaves that reduce water loss and aid in salt excretion. Its flowers are typically greenish or yellowish, and it produces small, dry fruits. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
