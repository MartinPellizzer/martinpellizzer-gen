    "intro": "Campanula patula var. costae, commonly known as the Woolly Bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and also covered with a fine layer of soft, white hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a drought-tolerant ground cover."
