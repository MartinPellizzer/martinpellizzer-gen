    "intro": "Campanula velutina var. microphylla, commonly known as the velvet bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are softly hairy, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens despite its limited distribution in the wild."
