    "intro": "Centropogon montanus f. subpubescens, commonly known as the hairy centropogon, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of southern Florida. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like blades. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. Its hairy texture, particularly on the stems and leaves, is a distinguishing feature of this subspecies. It plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by providing food and shelter for various invertebrates and birds."
