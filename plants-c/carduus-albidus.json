    "intro": "Carduus albidus, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and meadows. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a rough texture, and the flowers are white or pale yellow. Carduus albidus is often considered a weed but has been used historically in traditional medicine for its potential healing properties."
