    "intro": "Ctenopteris pensilis, commonly known as the hanging sea fern, is a species of fern native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often hang from rocky outcrops or cliffs near the shoreline. The plant thrives in humid, saline environments and is adapted to withstand coastal winds and salt spray. Its rhizomes grow horizontally along the substrate, anchoring the plant and facilitating the spread of its colonies. Ctenopteris pensilis plays a vital ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small marine and terrestrial organisms."
