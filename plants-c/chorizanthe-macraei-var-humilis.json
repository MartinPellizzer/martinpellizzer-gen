    "intro": "Chorizanthe macraei var. humilis, commonly known as the small-stemmed sand verbena, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters and has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects in dry landscapes."
