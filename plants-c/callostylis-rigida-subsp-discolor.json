    "intro": "Callostylis rigida subsp. discolor, commonly known as the variable rigid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wet or seasonally wet environments such as marshes, swampy areas, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. Its subspecies status reflects variations in leaf color and morphology, particularly the discoloration of the leaf blades. It plays a role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
