    "intro": "Calanthe vestita var. oweniana, commonly known as the Owen's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or among mossy rocks. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
