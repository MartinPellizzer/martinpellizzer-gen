    "intro": "Callista albosanguinea, commonly known as the white blood vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and heart-shaped, glossy green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds. Callista albosanguinea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
