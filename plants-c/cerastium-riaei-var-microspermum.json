    "intro": "Cerastium riaei var. microspermum, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe. It features prostrate stems that form dense mats, covered with small, spoon-shaped leaves. The flowers are white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, and bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salty, wind-swept environments. This plant is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
