It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
