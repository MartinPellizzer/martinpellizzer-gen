    "intro": "Campanula cochleariifolia var. brachyantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The leaves are narrow and lanceolate, often with a hairy texture, and are arranged alternately along the stem. This variety is distinguished by its shorter flower stems compared to the typical form, giving it a more compact appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
