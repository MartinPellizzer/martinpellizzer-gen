    "intro": "Cylindrokelupha tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin cylinder-fruit, is a rare and unique plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical fruits that develop from the base of the plant. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
