    "intro": "Campylostemon bequaertii, commonly known as the Hawaiian bignay, is a rare and endemic plant native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a flowering shrub belonging to the family Malvaceae, characterized by its woody stems and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as mesic forests and streamside areas. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Campylostemon bequaertii is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its unique botanical traits."
