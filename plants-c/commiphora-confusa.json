    "intro": "Commiphora confusa, commonly known as the African myrrh, is a small, deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that exudes a resin when damaged. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and oval-shaped, leathery leaves. Its resin, known as myrrh, has been used traditionally for its aromatic and medicinal properties. Commiphora confusa typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in savanna and woodland areas."
