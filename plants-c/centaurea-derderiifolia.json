    "intro": "Centaurea derderiifolia, commonly known as the Armenian knapweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Centaurea derderiifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
