    "intro": "Ctenitis sciaphila, commonly known as the shade fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Oleandraceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that thrive in low-light conditions. This plant is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in moist, shaded forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across the forest floor. The fronds are typically bioluminescent in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
