    "intro": "Craterostigma schweinfurthii, commonly known as the Schwerin's rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, demonstrating high drought tolerance. Its unique morphology and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
