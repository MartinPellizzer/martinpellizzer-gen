    "intro": "Cattleya jongheana, commonly known as the Jongheana orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Colombia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange with dark red or purple markings. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Cattleya jongheana is prized for its vibrant blooms and is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
