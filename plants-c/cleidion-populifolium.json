    "intro": "Cleidion populifolium, commonly known as the poplar-leafed cleidia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of poplar trees, hence its common name. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a fluffy, cotton-like seed dispersal mechanism. Cleidion populifolium is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
