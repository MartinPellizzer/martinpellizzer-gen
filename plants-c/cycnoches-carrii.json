    "intro": "Cycnoches carrii, commonly known as the Carri's cycnoches, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale blue with a distinctive yellow lip. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in the humid, shaded understory of its habitat. Its botanical features include long, strap-like leaves and a complex, intricate floral structure that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
