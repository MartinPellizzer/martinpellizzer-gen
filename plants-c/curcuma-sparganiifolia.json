    "intro": "Curcuma sparganiifolia, commonly known as the mountain turmeric, is a rhizomatous herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features upright, narrow leaves and produces clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant's rhizomes contain curcuminoids, similar to those found in common turmeric, and are valued for their potential anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often cultivated for both ornamental and medicinal purposes. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
