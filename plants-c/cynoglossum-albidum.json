    "intro": "Cynoglossum albidum, commonly known as white hound's tongue, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are hairy and often covered in a white waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Cynoglossum albidum is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
