    "intro": "Copaifera grandifolia, commonly known as Brazilian copaiba, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and large, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Its resin, known as copaiba balsam, is highly valued for its medicinal and aromatic properties. Copaifera grandifolia plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
