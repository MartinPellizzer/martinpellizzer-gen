    "intro": "Cynanchum grayi, commonly known as gray's milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its milky sap, a common feature among members of this family. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has slender, branching stems with small, opposite leaves. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish, and it produces capsule fruits that contain toxic seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by herbivores, which helps it survive in its arid environment."
