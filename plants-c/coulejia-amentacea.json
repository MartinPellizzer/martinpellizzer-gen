    "intro": "Coulejia amentacea, commonly known as the silverleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, silvery-green leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in wetland ecosystems. Coulejia amentacea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
