    "intro": "Carex parva, commonly known as small sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize new areas. Carex parva plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
