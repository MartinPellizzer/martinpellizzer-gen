    "intro": "Cercis occidentalis var. texensis, commonly known as the Texas redbud, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces small, flat pods that contain edible seeds, which are often consumed by wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun to partial shade. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to provide early-season color in gardens and natural landscapes."
