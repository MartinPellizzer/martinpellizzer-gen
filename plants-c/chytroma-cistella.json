    "intro": "Chytroma cistella, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in rocky habitats. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology, including a compact growth form and specialized root structures. The plant has small, often green or brownish flowers that are adapted to its specific ecological niche. It requires well-drained, mineral-rich soils and is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chytroma cistella is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
