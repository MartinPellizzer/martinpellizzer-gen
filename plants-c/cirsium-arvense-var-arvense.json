    "intro": "Cirsium arvense var. arvense, commonly known as Canada thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny leaves, which are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer, and it has a robust root system that allows it to spread aggressively. It is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its ability to form dense stands. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, also known as the daisy or sunflower family."
