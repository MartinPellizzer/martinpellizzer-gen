    "intro": "Celmisia petriei, commonly known as the Stewart Island Celmisia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, often on Stewart Island. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
