    "intro": "Crassina bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored sea lettuce, is a marine green alga found in coastal areas. It has a distinctive appearance with two different colored regions on its blade, typically green and brown. This plant thrives in shallow, tide-pool environments where it attaches to rocks or other substrates. Its simple structure consists of a flat, ribbon-like thallus with no true roots or stems. Crassina bicolor plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
