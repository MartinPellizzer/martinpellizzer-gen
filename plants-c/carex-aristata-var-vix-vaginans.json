It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known for their ecological importance in wetlands and disturbed soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshy areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil, making it valuable for ecological restoration projects."
