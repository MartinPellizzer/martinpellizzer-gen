    "intro": "Cryptanthus blitoides, commonly known as the \"Rainbow Waxlip\" or \"Blitoides Waxlip,\" is a species of flowering plant in the family Haemodoraceae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its dense, low-growing clusters of grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange and yellow, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Cryptanthus blitoides is well-suited for rock gardens and container planting due to its compact size and ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
