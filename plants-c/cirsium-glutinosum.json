    "intro": "Cirsium glutinosum, commonly known as sticky thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces a milky sap that can be sticky and irritating to the skin. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Cirsium glutinosum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in agricultural areas."
