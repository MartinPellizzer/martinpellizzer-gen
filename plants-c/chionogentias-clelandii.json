    "intro": "Chionogentias clelandii, commonly known as the Cleland's snowgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Chionogentias clelandii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry, disturbed areas."
