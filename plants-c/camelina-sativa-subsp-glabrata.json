    "intro": "Camelina sativa subsp. glabrata, commonly known as smooth camelina, is a subspecies of the camelina plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is an annual herb characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, though the subspecies glabrata is distinguished by its smoother, hairless surface. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It is valued for its oil-rich seeds, which are used in both culinary and industrial applications."
