    "intro": "Chamaecrista exigua var. minor, commonly known as the lesser burr legume, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, branched stems and small, pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive light green color. The plant produces clusters of yellow to orange flowers, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing small, hard seeds. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but also has potential value in ecological restoration projects."
