    "intro": "Ctenitis mearnsii, commonly known as Mearns' rockfern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ctenitis mearnsii is considered a rare and endangered species."
