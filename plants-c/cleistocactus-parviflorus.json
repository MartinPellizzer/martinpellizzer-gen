    "intro": "Cleistocactus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered closed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a small, globular cactus with a short stem and dense, spiny ribs. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that open only at night, a characteristic known as nyctinasty. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Cleistocactus parviflorus is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
