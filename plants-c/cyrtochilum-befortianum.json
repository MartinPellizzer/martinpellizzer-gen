It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns on the petals. Cyrtochilum befortianum thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
