    "intro": "Cissus dubia, commonly known as the ghost vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. Its unique foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments make it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Cissus dubia is also valued for its air-purifying properties and ability to climb various structures."
