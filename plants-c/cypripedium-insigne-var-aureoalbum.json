    "intro": "Cypripedium insigne var. aureoalbum, commonly known as the golden white lady's tresses, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, spiraled inflorescence composed of numerous showy, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive greenish lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest floors, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in association with other orchid species in montane ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in many regions."
