    "intro": "Cotinus szechuanensis, commonly known as the Sichuan smoke bush, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its striking, feathery inflorescences that resemble plumes, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellowish-green flowers in late summer, followed by red, fuzzy fruits. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green hue. Cotinus szechuanensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
