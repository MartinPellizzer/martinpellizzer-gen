    "intro": "Coccinia rehmannii var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a variant of the morning glory genus native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. This plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils near the coast, often in areas with high salinity and moderate to high humidity. The plant is adapted to withstand salt spray and tidal influences, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a common sight in mangrove forests and coastal scrublands."
