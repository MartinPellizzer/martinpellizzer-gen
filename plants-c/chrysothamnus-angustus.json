    "intro": "Chrysothamnus angustus, commonly known as the narrowleaf goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, silver-green leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in harsh conditions, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The species plays a role in supporting local pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
