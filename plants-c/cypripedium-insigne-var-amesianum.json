    "intro": "Cypripedium insigne var. amesianum, commonly known as the Amesian lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or lavender flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires specific soil conditions to thrive. Its foliage consists of broad, strap-like leaves, and it produces a single flower per stem. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
