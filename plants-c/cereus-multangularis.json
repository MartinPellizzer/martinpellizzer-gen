    "intro": "Cereus multangularis, commonly known as the angular cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in arid environments. Cereus multangularis is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
