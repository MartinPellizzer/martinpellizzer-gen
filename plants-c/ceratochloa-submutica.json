    "intro": "Ceratochloa submutica, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture that gives it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, cylindrical flower clusters. Ceratochloa submutica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
