    "intro": "Cyperus textilis, commonly known as spike grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow or white flowers, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Cyperus textilis is also valued for its fibrous roots, which have been historically used in textile production."
