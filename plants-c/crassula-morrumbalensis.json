It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapted to its arid environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for collectors and gardeners."
