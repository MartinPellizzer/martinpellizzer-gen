    "intro": "Chamaecytisus hirsutus subsp. leucotrichus, commonly known as the silver broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems covered in silvery-white hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. This subspecies is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness in coastal and dry environments."
