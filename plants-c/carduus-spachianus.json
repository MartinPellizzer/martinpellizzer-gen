    "intro": "Carduus spachianus, commonly known as the Spach's thistle, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, purple to pink flower heads that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes many other thistle and daisy species. The plant has been used historically for its medicinal properties, though it is generally considered a weed in agricultural settings."
