It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and is often found in forest understories. Its fruit is a small, dry schizocarp that splits into two parts when mature, a feature common in the Apiaceae family. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution."
