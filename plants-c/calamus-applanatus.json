    "intro": "Calamus applanatus, commonly known as the flat-stemmed arrowroot, is a species of flowering plant in the family Poaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its flat, rhizomatous stems that grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is often cultivated for its starchy rhizomes, which are used in traditional medicine and as a food source. Calamus applanatus thrives in wet, marshy environments and is often found in swampy or floodplain areas. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and cultural contexts."
