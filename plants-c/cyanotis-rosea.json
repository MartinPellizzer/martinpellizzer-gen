    "intro": "Cyanotis rosea, commonly known as the pink-flowered water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, pale pink to lavender flowers with a distinctive blueish hue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Cyanotis rosea thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for water gardens and wetland restoration projects."
