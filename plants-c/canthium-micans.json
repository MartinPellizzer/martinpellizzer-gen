    "intro": "Canthium micans, commonly known as the silverleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often surrounded by bracts. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Canthium micans thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as savannas and coastal dunes."
