    "intro": "Cuscuta microstyla var. obtusissima, commonly known as the blunt-stemded dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, thread-like appearance due to its slender stems. The plant is often found growing on a variety of hosts, including grasses and shrubs, in temperate regions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological interactions and can sometimes be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
