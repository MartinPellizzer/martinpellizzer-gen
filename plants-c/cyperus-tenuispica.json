    "intro": "Cyperus tenuispica, commonly known as slender spike sedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Cyperus tenuispica is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
