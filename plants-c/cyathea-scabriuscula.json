    "intro": "Cyathea scabriuscula, commonly known as the rough-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and storing nutrients. The fronds are typically dark green and have a rough, scaly texture on their underside, which gives the plant its common name."
