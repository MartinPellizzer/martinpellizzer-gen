    "intro": "Casearia aquifolia, commonly known as the water-leaf or water-leaf tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in botanical studies."
