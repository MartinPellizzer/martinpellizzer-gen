    "intro": "Calypso bulbosa f. americana, commonly known as the American starflower, is a striking perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a short, fibrous root system and produces small, bulb-like structures called corms, which store nutrients for the next growing season. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from the base of the plant. The species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats."
