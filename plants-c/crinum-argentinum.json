    "intro": "Crinum argentinum, commonly known as the Argentine crinum, is a bulbous plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in umbels at the top of tall, slender stems. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that form a dense rosette around the base of the bulb. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. Crinum argentinum is also noted for its strong, sometimes unpleasant fragrance, which can be both a characteristic and a deterrent to some gardeners."
