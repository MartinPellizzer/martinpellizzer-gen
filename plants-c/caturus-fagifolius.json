    "intro": "Caturus fagifolius, commonly known as the leafy caturus, is a lesser-known species within the Caturus genus. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule-like fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
