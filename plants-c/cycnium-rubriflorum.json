    "intro": "Cycnium rubriflorum, commonly known as the red-flowered hogweed, is a member of the Araliaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, red-tinted umbellate flowers. Native to the temperate regions of the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, shady environments. The plant produces small, dark brown berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous."
