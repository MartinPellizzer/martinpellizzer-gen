    "intro": "Crassula multiflora, commonly known as the rock rose or stone plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, compact growth with fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Crassula multiflora is popular as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant in gardens and rockeries."
