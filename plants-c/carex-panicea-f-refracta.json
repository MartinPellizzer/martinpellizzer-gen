    "intro": "Carex panicea f. refracta, commonly known as the refracta sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil in wetland areas. The flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, with the production of tiny, wind-pollinated flowers."
