    "intro": "Corydalis curviflora var. cytisiflora, commonly known as the narrowleaf corydalis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of delicate, pinkish-purple flowers with two upper lobes that curve backward. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variant is closely related to other members of the Fumariaceae family, sharing similar floral structures and growth habits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats."
