    "intro": "Cyperus crustaceus, commonly known as the marsh flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Cyperus crustaceus is also used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water."
