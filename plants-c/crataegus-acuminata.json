    "intro": "Crataegus acuminata, commonly known as the sharpthorn hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pinkish flowers in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally not consumed by humans. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with serrated edges, and it has a dense, bushy growth habit. Crataegus acuminata is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
