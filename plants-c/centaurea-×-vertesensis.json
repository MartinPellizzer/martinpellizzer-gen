    "intro": "Centaurea \u00d7 vertesensis, commonly known as the Hungarian star-thistle, is a hybrid plant species native to the Carpathian Basin. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and bright purple to pink flower heads that resemble stars. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, bracteate involucres. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
