    "intro": "Chloothamnus elatus, commonly known as the tall goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, upright stems and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Chloothamnus elatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
