It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in lowland and montane rainforests. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting the growth of the trunk and roots. The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, contributing to its ornamental value."
