It is characterized by its hairy, creeping stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in the morning. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive if not controlled."
