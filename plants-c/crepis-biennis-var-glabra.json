    "intro": "Crepis biennis var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth annual hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in a single, flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This variety is distinguished from other Crepis species by its lack of pubescence and its shorter, more compact growth habit."
