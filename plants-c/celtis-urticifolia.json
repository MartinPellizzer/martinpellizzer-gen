    "intro": "Celtis urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Americas. It belongs to the Cannabaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The leaves are covered in fine hairs that can cause an itchy rash upon contact, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by small, round berries that are edible for some bird species. The tree is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ecological role in supporting wildlife."
