    "intro": "Cardamine gongylodes, commonly known as the broad-leaved watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to that of watercress. It plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
