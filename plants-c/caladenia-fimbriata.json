It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, spider-like appearance with intricate, fimbriated petals. The plant typically grows in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers, which range in color from yellow to orange, are pollinated primarily by thynnid wasps.
