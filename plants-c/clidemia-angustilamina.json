    "intro": "Clidemia angustilamina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in humid, shaded environments. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and covered in fine, silky hairs. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Clidemia angustilamina is known for its ability to parasitize a variety of host trees, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its native habitats."
