It features dense, compact growth with dark green, almost black, leaves that are slightly fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during the warmer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
