    "intro": "Caucaliopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on tree branches or in moist, shaded environments, relying on its roots for nutrients. Caucaliopsis is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean cloud forests. Due to its rarity and ecological sensitivity, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in many areas."
