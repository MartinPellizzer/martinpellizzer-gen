    "intro": "Chironia lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinct reddish or purple hue on the underside. Its showy, purple to pink flower heads appear in late summer and are composed of numerous small florets. Chironia lanceolata is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
