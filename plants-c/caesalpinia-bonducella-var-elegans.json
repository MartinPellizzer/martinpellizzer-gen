    "intro": "Caesalpinia bonducella var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its bright red or orange floral bracts that resemble flames, which are often more showy than the small, yellow flowers. The plant has bipinnate leaves composed of numerous tiny leaflets, and its bark is smooth and light grey. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. The seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds when mature."
