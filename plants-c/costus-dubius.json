    "intro": "Costus dubius, commonly known as the pink costus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes gingers and turmeric. The plant features tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Costus dubius is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
