    "intro": "Crepis kilimandscharica var. keniensis, commonly known as the Kenyan hairgrass, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Kenya. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by achene fruits with pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in montane grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
