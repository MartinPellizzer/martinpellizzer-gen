    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 canescens, commonly known as the white thornapple or common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate to elliptical leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red to orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Botanically, it is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Crataegus monogyna and Crataegus laevigata, exhibiting a mix of traits from both parent species."
