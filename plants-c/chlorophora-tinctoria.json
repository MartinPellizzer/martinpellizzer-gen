    "intro": "Chlorophora tinctoria, commonly known as the African dye wood, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, palmate leaves. The plant is notable for its ability to produce a reddish dye from its wood, which has been traditionally used by indigenous communities. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and historical significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
