    "intro": "Cephalocarpus, commonly known as the bottlebrush plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive inflorescences, which resemble bottle brushes due to their dense clusters of small, red or yellow flowers. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Cephalocarpus species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often with smooth, bark-like stems. The genus is noted for its ornamental value, particularly in horticulture, due to its vibrant floral displays."
