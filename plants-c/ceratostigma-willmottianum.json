    "intro": "Ceratostigma willmottianum, commonly known as the winter jasmine, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to China. It features clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, preceding its foliage. The plant has wiry, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are dark green, oval-shaped, and provide dense ground cover. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
