It is characterized by its long, drooping clusters of yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds."
