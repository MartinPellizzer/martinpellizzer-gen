    "intro": "Chenorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive member of the orchid family. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Chenorchis species are typically found in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
