It features fleshy, trailing stems with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces delicate, tubular flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its compact growth habit, it is popular as a houseplant and is relatively easy to care for."
