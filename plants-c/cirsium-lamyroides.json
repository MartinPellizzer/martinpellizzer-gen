    "intro": "Cirsium lamyroides, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and large, purple to pinkish-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has deeply lobed, silver-green leaves covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowering heads are surrounded by bracts that form a protective layer around the central disk. Cirsium lamyroides is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in full sun."
