It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Cousinia \u00d7 dualis is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
