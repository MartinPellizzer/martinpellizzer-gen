    "intro": "Cotoneaster glaucophyllus var. serotinus, commonly known as the late-leaved cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central China. It features small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a fine, whitish pubescence, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries that are attractive to birds. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types. However, it may be invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
