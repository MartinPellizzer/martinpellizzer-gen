    "intro": "Ceropegia kituloensis, commonly known as the Kitulo moonvine, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude grasslands of Tanzania. It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green or white. The plant belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed-like species. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insects, such as moths and flies, due to their scent and nectar production. Ceropegia kituloensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and flowering habits."
