    "intro": "Cerastium arcticum var. edmondstonii, commonly known as Edmondston's snowberry, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or tundra environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, and it produces small, spherical berries that are red when mature. This variant is distinguished by its slightly larger size and more robust growth compared to other Cerastium species."
