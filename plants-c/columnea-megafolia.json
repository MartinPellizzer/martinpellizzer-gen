    "intro": "Columnea megafolia, commonly known as the giant leaf columnea, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, velvety, dark green leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange with a contrasting white or yellow throat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea megafolia is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
