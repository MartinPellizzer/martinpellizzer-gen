    "intro": "Crataegus bipinnatifida, commonly known as the Chinese hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately divided into two rows of smaller leaflets, giving it a finely toothed appearance. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible but often tart. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Crataegus bipinnatifida is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine."
