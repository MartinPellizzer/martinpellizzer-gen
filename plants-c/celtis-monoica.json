    "intro": "Celtis monoica, commonly known as the common hackberry, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to North America. It belongs to the Elaeocarpaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by round, green berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color. Celtis monoica is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in a variety of soil types, making it a hardy and adaptable species. It is often used in urban landscapes due to its tolerance to pollution and compact size."
