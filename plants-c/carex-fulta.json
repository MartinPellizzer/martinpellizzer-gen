    "intro": "Carex fulta, commonly known as the broadleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, strap-shaped leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in a cylindrical inflorescence. Carex fulta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
