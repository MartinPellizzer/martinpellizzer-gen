    "intro": "Chenopodium filiforme, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features slender, thread-like stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across sandy or gravelly soils. The leaves are small, fleshy, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This plant is often considered a weed but is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
