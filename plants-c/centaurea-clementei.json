    "intro": "Centaurea clementei, commonly known as Clement's cornflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its bright blue to purple flowers and spiny bracts. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, seed-like fruits called cypsela. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
