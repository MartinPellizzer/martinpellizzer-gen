    "intro": "Cheiridopsis parvibracteata, commonly known as the small-bract carpetweed, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring and summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
