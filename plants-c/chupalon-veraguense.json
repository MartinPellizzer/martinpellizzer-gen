    "intro": "Chupalon veraguense, commonly known as the Veraguas chupalon, is a rare and endemic plant species native to parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as tropical forests and is often found near streams or in humid understory habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
