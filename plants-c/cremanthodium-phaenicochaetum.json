    "intro": "Cremanthodium phaenicochaetum, commonly known as the goldenhead fleur-de-lis, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant is distinguished by its bright yellow to orange flowers, which are often surrounded by dense, hairy bracts. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
