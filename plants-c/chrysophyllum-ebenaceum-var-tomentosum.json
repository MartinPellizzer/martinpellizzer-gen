    "intro": "Chrysophyllum ebenaceum var. tomentosum, commonly known as the African cherry or yellow mango, is a tropical evergreen tree belonging to the Sapotaceae family. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, elliptical leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, yellow-orange fruits with a sweet, tangy flavor. The tree is native to tropical Africa and thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil. It is valued not only for its fruit but also for its timber, which is highly prized for its durability and fine grain."
