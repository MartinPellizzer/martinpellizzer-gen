    "intro": "Cypripedium himalaicum, commonly known as the Himalayan lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a unique adaptation for pollination. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in forested areas at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. Its leaves are broad and leathery, and it produces a single, elegant flower per stem. Due to its limited habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
