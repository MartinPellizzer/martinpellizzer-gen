    "intro": "Calanthe phajoides, commonly known as the Himalayan calanthe, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, with spatulate petals and a spurred lip that is often contrasting in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade, often found in forest understories. Calanthe phajoides is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
