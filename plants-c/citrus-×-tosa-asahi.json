    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 tosa-asahi, commonly known as Tosa Asahi, is a hybrid citrus plant originating from Japan. It is a cross between the mandarin and the pomelo, resulting in a fruit that is typically small to medium in size. The fruit has a thick, loose rind that is easy to peel, and the flesh is segmented with a sweet, tangy flavor. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruit. The plant is relatively cold-hardy and thrives in subtropical climates."
