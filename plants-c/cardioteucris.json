    "intro": "Cardioteucris, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in vibrant shades of red and purple. The plant's leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers are not only ornamental but also hold cultural and spiritual significance among indigenous communities. Cardioteucris is typically found growing in rocky soils and mountainous terrain, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates."
