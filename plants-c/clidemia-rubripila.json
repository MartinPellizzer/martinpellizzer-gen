    "intro": "Clidemia rubripila, commonly known as red-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Onagraceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are distinctly reddish in color. It attaches itself to host trees using specialized structures called haustoria, drawing nutrients and water from the host. Clidemia rubripila produces small, yellowish flowers followed by small, berry-like fruits that are important for local wildlife."
