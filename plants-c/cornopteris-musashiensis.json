    "intro": "Cornopteris musashiensis, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a rare fern species native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that resemble water lilies, allowing it to thrive in aquatic environments. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing spores in specialized structures called sporangia. Its leaves are typically divided into small, lobed segments, and it prefers still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
