    "intro": "Campanula versicolor f. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage and clusters of blue to violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. The varietal form 'tomentella' is distinguished by its dense, woolly covering on the leaves and stems, giving it a unique texture and appearance."
