    "intro": "Cayratia japonica var. pubifolia, commonly known as the Japanese climbing lychee, is a vigorous vining plant native to East Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with hairy undersides, giving it its varietal name \"pubifolia,\" which refers to the pubescent (hairy) texture. The plant produces small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spherical, red berries resembling lychees. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it suitable for trellises and as a ground cover in suitable environments."
