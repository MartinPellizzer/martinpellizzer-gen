It is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a woody stem with numerous branches and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats."
