    "intro": "Caragana sylvatica, commonly known as the Siberian peashrub, is a deciduous shrub native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 11 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers in early summer, followed by pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or dry slopes. Caragana sylvatica is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
