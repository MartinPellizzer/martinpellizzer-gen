    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 limetta var. tuberculosa, commonly known as the rough lemon, is a citrus hybrid characterized by its thick, bumpy rind and small, sour fruit. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is often used as a rootstock in citrus cultivation due to its hardiness. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves and produces fragrant white flowers. Its fruit, though not typically consumed for its juice, is valued in traditional medicine. The rough lemon's unique appearance and resilience make it an important species in horticultural research and breeding programs."
