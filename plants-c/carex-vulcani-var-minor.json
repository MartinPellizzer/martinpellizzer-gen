    "intro": "Carex vulcani var. minor, commonly known as the minor variant of Vulcan's sedge, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or marshy environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. The plant is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity in its native habitat."
