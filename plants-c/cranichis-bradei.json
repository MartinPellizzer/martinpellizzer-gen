    "intro": "Cranichis bradei, commonly known as the Brade's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its flowers are typically clustered in a spiral pattern along the stem, and it has a short flowering period. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cranichis bradei is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
