    "intro": "Cyperus orthostachyus var. orthostachyus, commonly known as the narrowleaf paperplant, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and linear, with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces spikes of small, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it both a common weed and a useful ornamental plant."
