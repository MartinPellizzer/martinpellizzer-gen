    "intro": "Carolinea nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are small, leathery, and arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. It produces small, pale yellow flowers in spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. This plant is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique texture and drought tolerance."
