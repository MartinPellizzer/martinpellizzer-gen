    "intro": "Convolvulus tournefortii, commonly known as desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that produces small, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has hairy, branching stems and heart-shaped leaves that are adapted to conserve water. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the afternoon, a characteristic known as nyctinasty. Convolvulus tournefortii is well-suited to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun."
