    "intro": "Ctenodon tenuis, commonly known as the slender thread-plant, is a rare aquatic fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like fronds that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters with abundant sunlight and nutrient-rich sediment. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically developing in the axils of the fronds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Ctenodon tenuis is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental degradation."
