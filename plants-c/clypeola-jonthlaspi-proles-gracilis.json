    "intro": "Clypeola jonthlaspi proles gracilis, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and its production of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophytes that bear spore capsules, which are typically clustered in dense, cylindrical structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or rocky crevices. Due to its delicate nature, it is typically found in specific microhabitats and is not widely cultivated."
