    "intro": "Convolvulus sprengelii, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with slender, twining stems that climb or trail along the ground. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pale purple or white, which bloom in the early morning. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The seeds are enclosed in a hairy, inflated capsule that disperses easily by wind."
