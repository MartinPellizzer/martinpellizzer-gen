    "intro": "Coronilla florida, commonly known as sweet clover, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and it thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps in nitrogen fixation. Coronilla florida is often used in agriculture as a forage crop and for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
