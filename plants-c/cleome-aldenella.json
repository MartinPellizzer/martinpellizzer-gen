    "intro": "Cleome aldenella, commonly known as the Mexican spiderflower, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking, spider-like flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom from summer to fall. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and slightly hairy, with a distinctive appearance that sets it apart from other cleome species. Cleome aldenella is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ease of care."
