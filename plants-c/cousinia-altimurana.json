    "intro": "Cousinia altimurana, commonly known as the highland cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine and arid environments, thriving at high altitudes where conditions are harsh. Its leaves are often silver-gray, adapted to reduce water loss in dry climates, while its flowers are small and yellowish, appearing in clusters. Cousinia altimurana plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme environments."
