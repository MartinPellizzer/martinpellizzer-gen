    "intro": "Crucianella angustifolia f. plagiotropica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea bean, is a rare flowering plant belonging to the family Violaceae. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that are clustered in racemes. It thrives in coastal environments, particularly in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
