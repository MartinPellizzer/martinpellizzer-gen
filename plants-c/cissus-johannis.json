It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and ability to thrive in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It has a shallow root system that helps stabilize soil in its native habitat. Cissus johannis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
