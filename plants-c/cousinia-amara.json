It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant is known for its aromatic, often pungent foliage and small yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Cousinia amara is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its bitter taste limits its culinary applications."
