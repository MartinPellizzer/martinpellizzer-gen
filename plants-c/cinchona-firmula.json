    "intro": "Cinchona firmula, commonly known as the dwarf quinine tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, shrub-like stature and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, red berries. The plant is notable for its historical use in the production of quinine, though it is less commercially significant than other cinchona species."
