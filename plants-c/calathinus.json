It is characterized by its unique, candle-like inflorescences that consist of a central stem surrounded by a cluster of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and have a velvety texture. Calathinus species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soil with moderate to high light exposure."
