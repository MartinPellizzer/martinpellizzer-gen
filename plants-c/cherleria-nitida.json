It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Cherleria nitida is adapted to arid environments and is relatively drought-tolerant."
