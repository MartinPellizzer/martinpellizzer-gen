    "intro": "Calyptranthes rupicola, commonly known as the rock calyptranthes, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It typically grows on rocky slopes and coastal bluffs, adapting to harsh, well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a leathery texture, and it produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring. Calyptranthes rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in coastal climates with minimal water. It is also an important plant for local pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
