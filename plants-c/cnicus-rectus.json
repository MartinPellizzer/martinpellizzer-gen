    "intro": "Cnicus rectus, commonly known as sow thistle, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and yellow flower heads that bloom in the summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in gardens. The plant contains compounds like lactucin and lutein, which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a common weed and a subject of ecological interest."
