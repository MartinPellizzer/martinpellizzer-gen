    "intro": "Cheilopsis arborea, commonly known as the tree orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tree-like structure and produces clusters of small, fragrant orchid flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments and thrives in well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are elongated and slightly hairy, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture efficiently. Cheilopsis arborea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
