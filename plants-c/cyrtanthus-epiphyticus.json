    "intro": "Cyrtanthus epiphyticus, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a unique member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Native to South Africa, it thrives in rocky, well-drained environments. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its botanical interest lies in its ability to survive in harsh, arid conditions with minimal water."
