    "intro": "Calla pentlandii, commonly known as the Pentland calla, is a striking aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It features a tall, narrow leaf blade that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length, with a distinctive white, spadix-like inflorescence surrounded by a large, pale green spathe. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its leaves are typically submerged, while the inflorescence emerges from the water surface. Calla pentlandii is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
