    "intro": "Cornus homerica, commonly known as the Homer's dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and turn red or orange in the fall. The plant produces small white or pinkish flowers in clusters, which are followed by red berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Cornus homerica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
