    "intro": "Cotoneaster microphyllus f. melanotrichus, commonly known as the black-haired cotoneaster, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves with distinctive blackish-brown hairy undersides, giving it its unique appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, red berries that are typically eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden ornamental use. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
