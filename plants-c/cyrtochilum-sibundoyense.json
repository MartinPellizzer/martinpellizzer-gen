    "intro": "Cyrtochilum sibundoyense, commonly known as the Sibundoy orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact, low-growing habit, featuring a pseudobulb and a single, narrow leaf. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinct, fragrant scent, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
