    "intro": "Carex echinata f. capitata, commonly known as the clustered spiky sedge, is a variant of the common spiky sedge, characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit. It is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family, typically found in wet or moist environments such as marshes and pond edges. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces cylindrical spikelets that are often densely packed. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system, which helps it spread and establish in suitable habitats. The inflorescence is usually compact, with male and female flowers arranged in separate spikes, typical of the Cyperaceae family."
