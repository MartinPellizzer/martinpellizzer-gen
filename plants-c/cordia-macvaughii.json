    "intro": "Cordia macvaughii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in the spring and summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds."
