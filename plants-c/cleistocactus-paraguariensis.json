    "intro": "Cleistocactus paraguariensis, commonly known as the Paraguariensis cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers that open only at night, a trait known as nocturnal anthesis. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
