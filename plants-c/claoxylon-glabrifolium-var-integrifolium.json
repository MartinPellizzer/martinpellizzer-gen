It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically smooth and entire along the margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release small, flat seeds. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in lowland rainforests."
