    "intro": "Croptilon divaricatum var. graniticum, commonly known as the granitic croptilon, is a rare plant species native to specific rocky habitats in southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth form and hairy, lance-shaped leaves adapted to withstand arid and nutrient-poor conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, contributing to its ecological role in pollination. Its root system is particularly adapted to anchor in crevices of granite formations, enhancing its resilience in harsh environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
