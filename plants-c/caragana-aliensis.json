    "intro": "Caragana aliensis, commonly known as the Siberian pea shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with 10 to 20 leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by pod fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to harsh environments and is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system. Botanically, it belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules."
