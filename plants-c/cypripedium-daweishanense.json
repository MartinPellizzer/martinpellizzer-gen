    "intro": "Cypripedium daweishanense, commonly known as the Daweishan lady's slipper, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to China. It is characterized by its striking, slipper-shaped flower with a deep pink to purple coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its leaves are broad and lanceolate, and it produces a single, showy flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
