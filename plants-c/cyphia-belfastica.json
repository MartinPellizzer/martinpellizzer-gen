    "intro": "Cyphia belfastica, commonly known as the Belfast bellflower, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the northeastern coast of Ireland. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along the rocky shores. The plant features showy blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Cyphia belfastica is critically threatened and is the subject of conservation efforts."
