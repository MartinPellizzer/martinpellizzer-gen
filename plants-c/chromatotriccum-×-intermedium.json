    "intro": "Chromatotriccum \u00d7 intermedium, commonly known as the hybrid marsh helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive purple spot on the lip. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils, often found in peat bogs and fens. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain Lepidoptera species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
