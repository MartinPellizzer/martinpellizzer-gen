    "intro": "Croton cerinus var. linifolius, commonly known as the silver croton, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its variegated, waxy leaves that display shades of green, white, and sometimes pink. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant features a thick, fleshy stem with a smooth, almost bark-like texture, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a pointed tip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
