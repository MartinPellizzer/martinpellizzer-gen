    "intro": "Clidemia pauciflora, commonly known as the white-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and showy white or pale pink flowers. The plant lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host trees via haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its parasitic nature and ornamental flowers, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
