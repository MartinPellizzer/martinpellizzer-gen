    "intro": "Cephalostigma erectum var. luteum, commonly known as the yellow bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a member of the family Limnanthaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy environments, often in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. It has a short life cycle, completing its growth and reproduction within a few weeks. Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
