It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, elliptical leaves with a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces fragrant yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, ornamental fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
