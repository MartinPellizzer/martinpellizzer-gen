    "intro": "Cuscuta hyalina var. nubiana, commonly known as the silver dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it thrives in dry, sunny environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and native vegetation."
