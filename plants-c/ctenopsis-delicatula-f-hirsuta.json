    "intro": "Ctenopsis delicatula f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy ctenopsis, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique hirsute (hairy) texture distinguishes it from other members of the Ctenopsis genus. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts in controlled conditions."
