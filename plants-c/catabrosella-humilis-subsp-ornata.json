    "intro": "Catabrosella humilis subsp. ornata, commonly known as the ornate catabrosella, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, often hairy leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
