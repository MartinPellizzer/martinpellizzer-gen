    "intro": "Camptophytum, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a unique hybrid plant that combines the vibrant colors of the cyrtophyllum with the hardy structure of the euphorbia. It is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in dry, sunny conditions. The plant's most distinctive feature is its swollen, colorful stem, which resembles a rounded, fleshy structure called a \"cactus\" despite not being a true cactus. Camptophytum is known for its striking red, orange, or yellow hues, which are produced by the cyrtophyllum component. Due to its compact size and eye-catching appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rockeries."
