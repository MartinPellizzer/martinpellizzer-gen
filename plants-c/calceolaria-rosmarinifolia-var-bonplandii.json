    "intro": "Calceolaria rosmarinifolia var. bonplandii, commonly known as the Bonpland's slipper orchid, is a striking flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, spurred flowers that resemble small slippers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic, similar to those of rosemary. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses, though it is relatively rare in the wild."
