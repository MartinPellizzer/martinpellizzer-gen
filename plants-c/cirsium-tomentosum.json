It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves that are covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces purple to violet flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in a spherical cluster. Its stems are generally erect and can grow up to 1.5 meters tall. Cirsium tomentosum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
