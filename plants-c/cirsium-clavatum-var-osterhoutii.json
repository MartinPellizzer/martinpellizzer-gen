    "intro": "Cirsium clavatum var. osterhoutii, commonly known as Osterhout's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, prairies, and disturbed soils. The plant features spiny, purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered with stiff, bristly hairs, contributing to its defensive adaptations. This variety is notable for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its historical use in traditional medicine."
