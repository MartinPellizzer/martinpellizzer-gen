    "intro": "Centaurium maritimum var. shuttleworthianum, commonly known as the coastal centaury, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, bright red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along sea shores, demonstrating a high tolerance for salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a low-growing habit, often forming dense mats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
