    "intro": "Cardamine fauriei var. oblonga, commonly known as the broad-leaved watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, basal leaves that are typically broad and ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves and stems are often submerged or partially submerged in water, adapting to wetland or aquatic environments. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to that of watercress."
