    "intro": "Cyphomandra dendroidea, commonly known as the tree tomato or yellow passionfruit, is a species of flowering plant in the Solanaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its woody stems and trailing or climbing growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow fruits that are often used in culinary applications due to their tart flavor. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are typically white or pale green with a distinctive scent. Cyphomandra dendroidea is valued not only for its edible fruits but also for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
