    "intro": "Centaurium chilense var. humile, commonly known as the Chilean lesser centaury, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is a perennial herb that produces small, capsule-like fruits containing minute seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
