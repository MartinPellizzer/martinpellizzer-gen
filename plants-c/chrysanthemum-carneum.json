It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads. Chrysanthemum carneum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
