    "intro": "Centaurea pyracantha, commonly known as the red centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features upright, branching stems that are covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Its most striking feature is its bright red or orange flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Centaurea pyracantha is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
