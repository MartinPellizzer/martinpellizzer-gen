    "intro": "Cassytha pubescens var. fasciculata, commonly known as the creeping buttonweed, is a herbaceous perennial vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, round, black berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a common weed in many parts of its range."
