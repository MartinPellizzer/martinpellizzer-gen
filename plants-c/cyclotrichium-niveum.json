    "intro": "Cyclotrichium niveum, commonly known as the snowbell, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its flowering stems are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. Cyclotrichium niveum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
