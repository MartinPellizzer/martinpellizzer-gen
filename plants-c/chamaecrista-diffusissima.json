    "intro": "Chamaecrista diffusissima, commonly known as the coastal burr or coastal burr legume, is a perennial shrub native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its botanical features make it an important plant for stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local wildlife."
