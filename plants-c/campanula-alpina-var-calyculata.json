    "intro": "Campanula alpina var. calyculata, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features upright, slender stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. The plant produces small, rounded seed capsules that disperse its seeds via the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly environments at elevations above 1,500 meters."
