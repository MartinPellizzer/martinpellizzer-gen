    "intro": "Ctenitis aquilina, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant's unique structure includes a central stem covered in a fibrous, spongy layer that aids in water retention. Its fronds are bioluminescent in certain conditions, which may play a role in attracting pollinators or deterring herbivores. Ctenitis aquilina is an important component of its ecosystem, providing habitat and contributing to the forest's biodiversity."
