    "intro": "Cuscuta karatavica, commonly known as the Karatavica dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed dispersal and attachment to host plants. The plant is native to Central Asia and is often found growing on various herbaceous and woody plants. Its morphology is characterized by thin, thread-like stems that wrap around the host, forming a network of connections. Despite its parasitic nature, Cuscuta karatavica plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant growth and contributing to seed dispersal through its seeds."
