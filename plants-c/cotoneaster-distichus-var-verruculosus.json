    "intro": "Cotoneaster distichus var. verruculosus, commonly known as the rough-leaved cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features dense, compact growth with dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in small, warty bumps, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and adaptability. This variety is particularly noted for its ability to thrive in a range of soil types and its resistance to pests and diseases."
