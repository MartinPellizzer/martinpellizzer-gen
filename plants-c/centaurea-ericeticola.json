    "intro": "Centaurea ericeticola, commonly known as the heath centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, acidic soils, often found in heathlands and open woodlands. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Centaurea ericeticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
