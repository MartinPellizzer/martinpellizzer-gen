    "intro": "Codiaeum obovatum, commonly known as the crocodile plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, waxy leaves that display vibrant, often variegated patterns in shades of green, red, and yellow. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, making it popular as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings. Codiaeum obovatum is relatively low maintenance but benefits from regular pruning to maintain its shape and encourage new growth."
