    "intro": "Ctenitis subglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular ctenitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The leaves are usually dark green and possess a leathery texture, with small glands present on the underside. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its unique botanical appearance."
