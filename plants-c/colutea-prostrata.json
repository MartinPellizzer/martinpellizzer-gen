    "intro": "Colutea prostrata, commonly known as creeping colutea, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to ovate leaflets with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, inflated pod that splits open to release the seeds. Colutea prostrata is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
