    "intro": "Cardamine dilatata, commonly known as broadleaf watercress, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically broad and heart-shaped, and its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors, often growing in rich, loamy soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion. The entire plant is often used in herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and tonic properties."
