    "intro": "Chaunanthus gracielae, commonly known as the Sierra Madre bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Sierra Madre Occidental region of Mexico. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, showy blossoms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
