It is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage with leaves that display shades of green, yellow, and red. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens with appropriate conditions."
