    "intro": "Cissus decidua, commonly known as the rock fig or desert fig, is a climbing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and opposite, ovate leaves that often turn reddish or bronze in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Cissus decidua is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water, featuring succulent stems and leaves. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in its native habitats."
