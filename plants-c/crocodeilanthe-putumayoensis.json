    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe putumayoensis, commonly known as the Putumayo staghorn fern, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that resemble the antlers of a staghorn. The plant typically grows on trees, using them for support rather than deriving nutrients from them. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, helping it anchor to its host. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is found primarily in the Putumayo region of Colombia."
