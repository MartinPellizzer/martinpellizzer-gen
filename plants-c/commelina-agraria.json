    "intro": "Commelina agraria, commonly known as the small blue morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Commelinaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has slender, branched stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to spread rapidly, it can become invasive in certain environments."
