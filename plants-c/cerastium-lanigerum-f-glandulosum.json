    "intro": "Cerastium lanigerum f. glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in glandular hairs. The flowers are typically white or pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. This plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates."
