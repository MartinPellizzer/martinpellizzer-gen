    "intro": "Cardamine nudicaulis, commonly known as the slender water crowfoot, is a small perennial herb native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water, aiding in its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically appearing in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in wetland areas. Cardamine nudicaulis is often found in streams, ponds, and along the edges of marshes, where it plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems."
