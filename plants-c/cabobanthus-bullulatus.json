    "intro": "Cabobanthus bullulatus, commonly known as the hummingbird's bell, is a striking desert plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features striking, tubular, bright red flowers that resemble small bells, which are adapted to attract hummingbirds for pollination. The plant has a short, woody stem with dense, gray-green foliage that helps it conserve water in arid environments. Its flowering period typically occurs in the spring and early summer, adding vibrant color to the desert landscape. Cabobanthus bullulatus is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
