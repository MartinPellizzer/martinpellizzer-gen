    "intro": "Carum diversifolium, commonly known as the variable leaf caraway, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic herbs like parsley and dill. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers that appear in umbels. Its seeds, like those of other caraway species, are often used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Carum diversifolium thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
