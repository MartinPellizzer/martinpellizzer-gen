It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, pink, or yellow. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation.
