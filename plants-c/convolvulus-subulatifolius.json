    "intro": "Convolvulus subulatifolius, commonly known as the needleleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant belongs to the Convolvulaceae family, which includes other morning glories, and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its spread in disturbed habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
