    "intro": "Cactus uncinatus, commonly known as the hook cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its spines are short and hooked, providing protection from herbivores. Cactus uncinatus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
