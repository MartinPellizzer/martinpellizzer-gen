    "intro": "Clematis parviloba var. rhombicoelliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, twining stems that can grow up to 15 feet in length, supporting its climbing habit. The leaves are alternate, simple, and typically elliptic or rhombic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and usually white or pale blue, appearing in clusters during the late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance and ability to climb trellises or supports."
