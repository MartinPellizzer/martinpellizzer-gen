    "intro": "Copiapoa megarhiza subsp. parvula, commonly known as the small-flowered copiapoa, is a species of cactus native to northern Chile. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the cooler months, usually in spring. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected plant."
