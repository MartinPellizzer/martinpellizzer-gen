    "intro": "Cyathidium, commonly known as the horned cup, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive cyathium inflorescence, which resembles a cup and is typically composed of a single female flower surrounded by several male flowers. The leaves are usually palmately lobed and have a rough texture. Cyathidium species are often found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. These plants are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value due to their unique floral structure."
