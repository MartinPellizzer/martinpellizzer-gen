    "intro": "Calanthe graciliflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered calanthe, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, and it has a pseudobulb structure typical of many orchid species. Calanthe graciliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
