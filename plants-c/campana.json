Campana species are typically herbaceous perennials, with some varieties growing as annuals or shrubs. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky habitats. The flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, making them valuable additions to gardens and natural ecosystems."
