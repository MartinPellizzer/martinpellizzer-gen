    "intro": "Callistachys scandens, commonly known as the climbing buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, which are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
