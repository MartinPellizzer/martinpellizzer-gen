    "intro": "Cirsium flavispina var. longespinosum, commonly known as the long-spined yellow thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, leafy stems and large, yellow to orange flower heads that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically covered in fine hairs and have a serrated edge, contributing to its prickly appearance. This variety is distinguished by its longer spines compared to the typical form of Cirsium flavispina. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
