    "intro": "Crotalaria recumbens, commonly known as the sicklepod, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a low-growing annual herb that produces distinctive yellow flowers with prominent black or brown seed pods. The plant has compound leaves with pairs of ovate leaflets and is often found in disturbed soils and agricultural fields. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. However, it is considered a weed in many areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
