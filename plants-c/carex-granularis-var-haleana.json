    "intro": "Carex granularis var. haleana, commonly known as Hale's sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the wetlands of Hawaii. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
