    "intro": "Cyanea ovatisepala, commonly known as the broad-sepal cyanea, is a member of the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and is characterized by its distinctive, broad, ovate sepals that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub, with small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Cyanea ovatisepala is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and its role in the native flora of Hawaii."
