    "intro": "Cephalanthus stellatus, commonly known as the fragrant swamp willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge, while its bark is smooth and reddish-brown. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
