    "intro": "Cyrilla racemiflora var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved coralbark, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical Cyrilla racemiflora. The plant produces fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in terminal racemes during the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming more prominent as the plant matures. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant for gardens and landscapes."
