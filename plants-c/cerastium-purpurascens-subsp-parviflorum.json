    "intro": "Cerastium purpurascens subsp. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are typically arranged in umbels. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
