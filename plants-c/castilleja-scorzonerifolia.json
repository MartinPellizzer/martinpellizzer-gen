    "intro": "Castilleja scorzonerifolia, commonly known as the scarlet globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Castilleja scorzonerifolia is adapted to dry, sunny habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands."
