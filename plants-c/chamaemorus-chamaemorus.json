    "intro": "Chamaemorus chamaemorus, commonly known as cloudberry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in moist, sandy or peaty habitats. The plant produces small, yellow-orange berries that are rich in vitamin C and have a distinctive tart flavor. Its leaves are typically prostrate, forming dense mats that help insulate the soil. The species is well-adapted to cold climates and has a long history of use by indigenous peoples for both food and traditional medicine."
