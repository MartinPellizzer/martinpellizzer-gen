    "intro": "Carnegiea, commonly known as the saguaro cactus, is a distinctive species native to the Sonoran Desert of Arizona and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that can grow up to 50 feet in height, with a thick, ribbed structure that stores water efficiently. The plant's flowers, which bloom in spring, are typically yellow or white and attract various pollinators such as bats and birds. Carnegiea has a slow growth rate, often taking decades to reach maturity, and can live for over 150 years. Its ecological importance is significant, as it provides habitat and food for numerous desert species."
