    "intro": "Caiophora pachylepis, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a floating platform for various aquatic organisms. The plant has a unique root system that anchors it in shallow water while allowing it to spread across the water's surface. Its flowers are typically white or pink, blooming at night and attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its size and ecological role, it plays a significant part in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its habitat."
