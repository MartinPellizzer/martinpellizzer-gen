    "intro": "Cyphocarpa pallida, commonly known as the white-flowered sandmat, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has aromatic, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Cyphocarpa pallida typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun. It is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities, contributing to the ecological diversity of these regions."
