It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has a unique root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a crucial role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for native pollinators. Due to habitat destruction, it faces significant threats to its survival."
