    "intro": "Corybas arachnoideus, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its striking, spider-like appearance with a single, hairy, urn-shaped flower. The plant is typically found in rocky or coastal habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, such as flies, which are attracted to its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
