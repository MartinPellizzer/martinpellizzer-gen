    "intro": "Collomia tinctoria, commonly known as the red paintbrush, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its striking red or pink bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Collomia tinctoria is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
