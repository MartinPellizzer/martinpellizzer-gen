    "intro": "Campanula sparsa, commonly known as the sparse bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Campanula sparsa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, long-lasting blooms."
