    "intro": "Cotula membranifolia, commonly known as the paperleaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine, membranous layer, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Cotula membranifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in floral arrangements."
