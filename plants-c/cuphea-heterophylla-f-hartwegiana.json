    "intro": "Cuphea heterophylla f. hartwegiana, commonly known as the Hartweg's firecracker plant, is a strikingly ornamental species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This cultivar is prized for its vibrant blooms and is commonly used in gardens and as a container plant."
