    "intro": "Chamaesyce consanguinea, commonly known as the common sand mat, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Chamaesyce consanguinea is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils, making it a common sight in desert and semi-desert regions."
