    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. bulbosa, commonly known as the hazel nut tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and serrated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces catkins in early spring, with male and female flowers on separate plants. Its edible nuts develop in cupules, which are modified leaf structures that enclose the true nuts. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional herbal medicine."
