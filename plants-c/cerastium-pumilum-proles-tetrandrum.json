    "intro": "Cerastium pumilum proles tetrandrum, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant typically forms dense mats on the ground, often in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or rocky soils. Its flowers have four stamens, a feature that distinguishes it from other species in the Cerastium genus. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in garden settings."
