    "intro": "Clusia laurifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Clusia laurifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in shaded or low-light conditions."
