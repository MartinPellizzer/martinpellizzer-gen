It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in cylindrical heads, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
