    "intro": "Cladium micranthes, commonly known as the small-flowered sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and small, white or pale green flowers that appear in spike-like clusters. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often waterlogged habitat. Cladium micranthes plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to the structure and biodiversity of these wetland habitats."
