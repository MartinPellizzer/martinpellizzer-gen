    "intro": "Coffea quillon, commonly known as the Quillon coffee. It is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family, native to the tropical regions of Africa. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds used for coffee production. It is less commonly cultivated than other Coffea species, such as Arabica and Robusta. Due to its limited distribution and specific growing conditions, it is considered a rare and under-researched coffee variety."
