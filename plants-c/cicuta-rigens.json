    "intro": "Cicuta rigens, commonly known as water hemlock, is a toxic flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features a tall, hollow stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers clustered in umbrella-like inflorescences. The plant contains potent toxins, particularly cicutoxin, which can cause severe poisoning in humans and animals. Its roots are often mistaken for parsley or poison hemlock, leading to accidental ingestion. Due to its extreme toxicity, it is considered one of the most dangerous plants in North America."
