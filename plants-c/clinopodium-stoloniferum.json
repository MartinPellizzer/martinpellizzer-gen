    "intro": "Clinopodium stoloniferum, commonly known as creeping betony, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively across the ground. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with slightly serrated edges and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Clinopodium stoloniferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional herbal medicine."
