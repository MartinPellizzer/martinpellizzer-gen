    "intro": "Cynosurus elegans var. fertilis, commonly known as the fertile bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
