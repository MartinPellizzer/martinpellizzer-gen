    "intro": "Cyperus rotundus var. centiflorus, commonly known as purple flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, cylindrical stems that often grow close to the ground, with small, scale-like leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces dense clusters of tiny, purple or pink flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, it can become invasive in certain environments."
