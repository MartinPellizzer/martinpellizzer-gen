It is characterized by its finely hairy, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces elongated, slender pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and for soil enrichment."
