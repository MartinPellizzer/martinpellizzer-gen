    "intro": "Cyclosorus aquatiloides, commonly known as the waterwheel liverwort, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is characterized by its thallus, which is typically green and forms dense mats on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a structure composed of rhizoids and leaf-like structures called phyllids. It thrives in nutrient-rich, shallow waters and is often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands. Cyclosorus aquatiloides plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
