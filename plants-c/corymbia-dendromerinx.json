    "intro": "Corymbia dendromerinx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical and subtropical regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin, flaky layers, and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and glossy. The tree produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by round, red or orange fruits. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and a preference for well-drained soils. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its unique appearance."
