    "intro": "Carex mixta, commonly known as the mixed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
