    "intro": "Cenchrus cafer, commonly known as the African grass or red grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in warm, dry climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Cenchrus cafer is valued for its use in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
