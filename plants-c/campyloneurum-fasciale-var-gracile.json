    "intro": "Campyloneurum fasciale var. gracile, commonly known as the slender-leafed rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist forest floors, thriving in humid environments. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
