    "intro": "Chamaeraphis muricata, commonly known as the rough glassworts, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries where it tolerates high salinity and fluctuating water levels. Its small, green flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils. Chamaeraphis muricata is also used in phytoremediation efforts due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated soils."
