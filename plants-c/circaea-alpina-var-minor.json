It features small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy, alternate leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
