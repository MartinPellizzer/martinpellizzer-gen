    "intro": "Cybianthus alpestris, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue or pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to withstand cold and windy conditions. Cybianthus alpestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
