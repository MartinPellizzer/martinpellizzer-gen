    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the downy hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically oval with serrated edges and turn yellow in autumn. Its berries, which are red or orange when mature, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. This variety is distinguished by its dense, downy hairs on the young shoots and leaves, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance."
