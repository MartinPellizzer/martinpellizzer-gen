    "intro": "Campanula densifoliata, commonly known as the dense-leaved bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features broad, dark green leaves that are densely packed, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Campanula densifoliata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
