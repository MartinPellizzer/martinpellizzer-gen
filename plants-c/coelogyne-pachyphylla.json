    "intro": "Coelogyne pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leafed orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its often arid or semi-arid habitat. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a red or purple lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular among orchid enthusiasts and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
