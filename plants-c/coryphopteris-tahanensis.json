    "intro": "Coryphopteris tahanensis, commonly known as the Tahan fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Guam. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a serrated margin and a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in the humid tropical climate. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing clusters, are positioned on the underside of its fronds, a feature common among ferns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
