    "intro": "Calceolaria dentata subsp. dentata, commonly known as the toothed calceolaria, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive calyx-shaped petals, which resemble small cups or bells. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have serrated edges, contributing to its common name. It produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
