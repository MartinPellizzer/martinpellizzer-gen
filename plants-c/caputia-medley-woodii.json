    "intro": "Caputia medley-woodii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a slow-growing, deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, corky bark and long, pendulous branches that often droop toward the ground. The tree produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer, followed by round, greenish-yellow fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a waxy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Caputia medley-woodii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
