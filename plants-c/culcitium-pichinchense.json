    "intro": "Culcitium pichinchense, commonly known as the Pichincha cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and reproduces through cones. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
