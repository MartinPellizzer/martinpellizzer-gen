    "intro": "Convolvulus bilobatus, commonly known as the two-lobed morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous annual that produces attractive, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant has a climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports or other vegetation. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a distinctive two-lobed base, contributing to its ornamental value. The flowers typically bloom in the morning, hence its common name, and are pollinated by insects."
