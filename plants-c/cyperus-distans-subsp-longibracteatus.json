    "intro": "Cyperus distans subsp. longibracteatus, commonly known as the long-bract sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often green or reddish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense stands that can dominate wetland habitats. It is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
