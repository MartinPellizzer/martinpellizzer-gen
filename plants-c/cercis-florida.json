    "intro": "Cercis florida, commonly known as the Eastern redbud, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and produces small, legume-like pods that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. The Eastern redbud is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing early nectar sources for pollinators."
