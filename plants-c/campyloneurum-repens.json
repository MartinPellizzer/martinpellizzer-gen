    "intro": "Campyloneurum repens, commonly known as the creeping campyloneurum, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that root at the nodes and produce leaves along their length. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and they are often covered in fine, silky hairs. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
