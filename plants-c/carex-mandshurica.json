It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers that are wind-pollinated. Carex mandshurica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
