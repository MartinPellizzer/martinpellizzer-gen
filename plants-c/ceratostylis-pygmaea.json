    "intro": "Ceratostylis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf flame orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Australia. It features delicate, linear leaves and produces striking, red-brown or orange-red flowers with a distinctive, elongated spur. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are often short-lived but highly ornamental, attracting specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
