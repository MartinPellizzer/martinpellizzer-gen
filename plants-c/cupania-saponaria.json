    "intro": "Cupania saponaria, commonly known as soapberry or saponaria, is a flowering plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, pink or white bracteate flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, sticky aril. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Its saponin-rich berries have historically been used in traditional medicine and as a natural soap substitute."
