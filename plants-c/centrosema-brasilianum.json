    "intro": "Centrosema brasilianum, commonly known as Brazilian strapping vine, is a leguminous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria. Centrosema brasilianum is also used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop."
