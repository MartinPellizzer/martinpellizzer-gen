    "intro": "Cynanchum microphylum, commonly known as small-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, hooked seed pods. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Due to its ecological significance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens."
