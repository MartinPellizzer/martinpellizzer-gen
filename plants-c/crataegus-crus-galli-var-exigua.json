It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, thorned branches and clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
