    "intro": "Carpolobia, commonly known as the \"spearhead plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, club-shaped fruits that resemble a spearhead, which is a key botanical feature. The plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are often found in moist, shaded environments. They have palmately lobed leaves and produce showy, yellow or white flowers. Carpolobia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique foliage and floral display."
