    "intro": "Cyperus conicus var. glaucinus, commonly known as the blue rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow or white flowers, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found in wetlands or along water bodies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for ornamental use in water gardens or as a ground cover."
