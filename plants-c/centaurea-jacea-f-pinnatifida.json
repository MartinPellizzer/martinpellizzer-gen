    "intro": "Centaurea jacea f. pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gladiola, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its slender, pinnatifid (bifurcated) leaves and striking blue to purple flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its flowers consist of ray florets surrounding a central disk, typical of the genus Centaurea. This form is a variant of Centaurea jacea, distinguished by its finely divided foliage and compact growth habit."
