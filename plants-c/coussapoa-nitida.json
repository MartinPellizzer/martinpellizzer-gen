    "intro": "Coussapoa nitida, commonly known as the white-leafed cactus or silver cactus, is a species of cactus native to the dry regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the dry season, typically in the spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Coussapoa nitida is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and low rainfall."
