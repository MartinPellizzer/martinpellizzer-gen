    "intro": "Carex canescens var. heterostachya, commonly known as the rough sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike of pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is distinguished by its slightly different floral structure compared to the typical Carex canescens."
