    "intro": "Cuphea wrightii var. nematopetala, commonly known as the pink false heather, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its showy, tubular pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, round, violet-colored berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is well-suited for gardens and landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in partial shade."
