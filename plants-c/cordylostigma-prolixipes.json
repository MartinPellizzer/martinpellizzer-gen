    "intro": "Cordylostigma prolixipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that thrives on a variety of host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white flowers. The plant produces fleshy, sticky berries that are a food source for birds and other animals. Its root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. Due to its ecological significance and unique parasitic nature, it plays an important role in forest ecosystems."
