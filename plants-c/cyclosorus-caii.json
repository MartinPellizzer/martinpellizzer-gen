    "intro": "Cyclosorus caii, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to China. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that form a rosette shape on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus caii is considered an important species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
