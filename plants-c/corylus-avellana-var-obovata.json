    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. obovata, commonly known as the European hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It features slender, zigzagging branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces male and female flowers on the same plant, with the female flowers developing into edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. The nuts are typically harvested in late summer to early autumn and are valued for their rich flavor and nutritional content. This variety is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
