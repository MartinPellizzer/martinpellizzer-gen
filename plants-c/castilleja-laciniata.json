    "intro": "Castilleja laciniata, commonly known as the fringed Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its striking appearance makes it a popular subject in botanical gardens and natural areas."
