    "intro": "Centaurea variabilis, commonly known as the variable centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Centaurea variabilis is known for its variability in flower color and plant form, contributing to its common name."
