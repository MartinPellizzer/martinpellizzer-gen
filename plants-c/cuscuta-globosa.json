    "intro": "Cuscuta globosa, commonly known as the globeflower dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment. It produces small, white or yellow flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves germinating on the surface of host plants before establishing a connection through specialized root-like structures called haustoria. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on various herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can be a common weed in agricultural and natural areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
