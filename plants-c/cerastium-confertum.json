    "intro": "Cerastium confertum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically rounded or heart-shaped, and it produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its stems are often prostrate, and it spreads by both seeds and rhizomes. Cerastium confertum is often found in cool, temperate climates and is known for its ability to colonize disturbed soils."
