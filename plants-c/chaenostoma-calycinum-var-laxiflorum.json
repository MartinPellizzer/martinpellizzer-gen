    "intro": "Chaenostoma calycinum var. laxiflorum, commonly known as the laxiflorous water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features elongated, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and are usually greenish-white in color. This variant is distinguished by its more loosely arranged floral clusters compared to the typical form of Chaenostoma calycinum."
