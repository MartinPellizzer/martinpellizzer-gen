    "intro": "Calacanthus grandiflorus, commonly known as the Christmas bell, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late winter to early spring. These flowers are borne on long, slender stalks and are highly attractive to pollinators such as birds and insects. Calacanthus grandiflorus is well-suited for gardens with well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight."
