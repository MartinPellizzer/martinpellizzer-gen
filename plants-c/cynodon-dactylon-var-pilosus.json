    "intro": "Cynodon dactylon var. pilosus, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in hot, dry climates. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture, which is a distinguishing feature of the varietal form pilosus. It is widely used for turfgrass due to its durability and low maintenance requirements. Additionally, it plays an important role in soil stabilization and erosion control in arid environments."
