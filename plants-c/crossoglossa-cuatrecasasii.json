    "intro": "Crossoglossa cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cauca mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, showy flowers that typically display a combination of white, purple, and green hues. The plant thrives in high-altitude cloud forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal relationships for nutrient uptake. Its botanical features include a slender stem, lance-shaped leaves, and a single, elongated flower spike. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
