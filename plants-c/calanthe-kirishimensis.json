    "intro": "Calanthe kirishimensis, commonly known as the Kirishima calanthe, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to Japan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it thrives in the understory of temperate deciduous forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, while the flowers are usually pink or white with intricate markings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
