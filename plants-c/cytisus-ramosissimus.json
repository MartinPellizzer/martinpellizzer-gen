    "intro": "Cytisus ramosissimus, commonly known as the creeping yellow broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in racemes during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are small, trifoliate, and covered in fine hairs. Cytisus ramosissimus is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
