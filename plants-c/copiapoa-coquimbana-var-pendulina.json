    "intro": "Copiapoa coquimbana var. pendulina, commonly known as the pendant copiapoa, is a cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its cylindrical, often pendulous stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its stems are covered in dense, white spines that provide insulation and protection from intense sunlight. This variety is well adapted to arid conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
