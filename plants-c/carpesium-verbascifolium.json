    "intro": "Carpesium verbascifolium, commonly known as the woolly beggar-tick, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the eastern United States and is characterized by its hairy, bristly stems and leaves that resemble those of the mullein plant. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Carpesium verbascifolium is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems."
