    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta var. multicaulis, commonly known as the hairy watercress, is a perennial herb native to moist, shady environments in temperate regions. It features a rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces small, white flowers with four petals, typically arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-rich aquatic or semi-aquatic soils. This variant is distinguished by its multiple stems, which contribute to its common name \"multicaulis.\""
