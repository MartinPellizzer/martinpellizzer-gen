    "intro": "Croton megalocarpus, commonly known as the giant croton, is a tropical plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, spiky, orange-red fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its size and growth habit, it is typically grown in large containers or in open spaces where it can spread its extensive root system."
