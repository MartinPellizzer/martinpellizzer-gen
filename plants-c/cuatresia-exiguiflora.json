    "intro": "Cuatresia exiguiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered quatresia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival. Its unique botanical features make it an important subject for botanical research and ecological studies."
