    "intro": "Comaclinium montanum, commonly known as the mountain comaclinium, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as mountainous areas, where it thrives in cooler, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged alternately along the stem, and its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
