    "intro": "Cranichis queremalensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, leafless stem and a single, showy white or pale pink flower. The plant is characterized by its unique, elongated flower that resembles a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high elevations, often growing on rocky substrates. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
