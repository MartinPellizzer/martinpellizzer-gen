    "intro": "Carpinus tropicalis subsp. mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to the humid lowlands of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by small, round nuts enclosed in a spiky husk. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
