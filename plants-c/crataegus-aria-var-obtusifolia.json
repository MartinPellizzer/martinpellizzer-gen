    "intro": "Crataegus aria var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-leaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and features thorny branches, which are a characteristic feature of the Crataegus genus. The leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and they turn red or orange in the fall. The plant produces white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade."
