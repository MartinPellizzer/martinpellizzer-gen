    "intro": "Chrysanthemum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chrysanthemum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, branching stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, adorned with finely cut, narrow, and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, white, and orange, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value and adaptability contribute to its cultivation in horticulture."
