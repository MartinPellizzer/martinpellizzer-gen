    "intro": "Cirsium fuscotrichum, commonly known as the rusty-hairy thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, rusty-colored hairs, which give it its common name. The species is part of the Asteraceae family and is valued for its ornamental qualities as well as its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
