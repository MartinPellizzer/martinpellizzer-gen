    "intro": "Crepidiastrum denticulatum f. pinnatipartitum, commonly known as the silverleaf sterculia, is a variant of the sterculia tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, pinnately compound leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, three-lobed capsules as its fruit. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands. Its ornamental value comes from its elegant foliage and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
