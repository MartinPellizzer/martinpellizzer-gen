    "intro": "Cereus pseudomelanostele var. laredensis, commonly known as the Laredo candle cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach up to 3 meters in height, covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces large, nocturnal flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, opening only during the evening. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
