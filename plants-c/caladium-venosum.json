    "intro": "Caladium venosum, commonly known as the veiny caladium, is a tropical perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with intricate, vein-like patterns in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the main ornamental feature, making it popular in gardens and as a houseplant. Caladium venosum is typically propagated through tuberous roots and blooms with small, inconspicuous flowers that are rarely seen."
