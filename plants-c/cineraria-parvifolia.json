    "intro": "Cineraria parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved cineraria, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features woolly, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. It produces showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Cineraria parvifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive appearance and hardiness in mild climates."
