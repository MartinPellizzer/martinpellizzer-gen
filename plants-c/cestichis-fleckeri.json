    "intro": "Cestichis fleckeri, commonly known as the Flecker's cestichis, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many ornamental and horticulturally valuable species. The plant is characterized by its delicate, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cestichis fleckeri is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
