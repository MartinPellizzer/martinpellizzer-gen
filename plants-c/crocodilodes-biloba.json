    "intro": "Crocodilodes biloba, commonly known as the African sand orchid, is a rare and unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces striking, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the rainy season, often in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping it store water for extended periods. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
