    "intro": "Cotyledon dichotoma, commonly known as the \"Double Leaf\" or \"Coral Cotyledon,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with red or purple edges, and it produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is characterized by its unique branching pattern, with each stem splitting into two at the base, giving it a dichotomous appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
