It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft pubescence. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in agricultural and horticultural settings."
