    "intro": "Castanea sativa, commonly known as the sweet chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces spiny, cup-like fruits that contain one or more edible nuts. The nuts are encased in a thick, fibrous husk that splits open when mature. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and its historical use in agriculture and forestry."
