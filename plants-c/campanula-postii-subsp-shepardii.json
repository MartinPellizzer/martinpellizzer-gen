The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
