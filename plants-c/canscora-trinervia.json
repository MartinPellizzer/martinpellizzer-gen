    "intro": "Canscora trinervia, commonly known as the African arrowroot or arrowleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
