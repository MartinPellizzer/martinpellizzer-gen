    "intro": "Coniogramme africana, commonly known as African shield fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically broad and leathery. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its spores are dispersed through the wind. The botanical features of Coniogramme africana make it a unique and recognizable member of the Dryopteridaceae family."
