    "intro": "Caralluma priogonium, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Caralluma priogonium is also known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in extreme drought conditions."
