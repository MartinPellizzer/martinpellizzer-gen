    "intro": "Ctenobryum, commonly known as the feather moss, is a genus of mosses belonging to the family Pottiaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, hair-like leaves that are often arranged in dense, cushion-like formations. Ctenobryum species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. They play an important role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in their habitats. Due to their small size and specialized structure, they are well adapted to survive in harsh conditions."
