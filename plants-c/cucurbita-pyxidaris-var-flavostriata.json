    "intro": "Cucurbita pyxidaris var. flavostriata, commonly known as the yellow-striped cucumber gourd, is a variant of the bottle gourd native to the Americas. It is characterized by its elongated, bottle-shaped fruit with a distinctive yellow-green striped pattern. The plant is a vigorous vine that produces edible fruits, though they are often used for ornamental purposes due to their unique appearance. The leaves are large, heart-shaped, and lobed, typical of the Cucurbitaceae family. It thrives in warm climates and requires full sun and well-drained soil for optimal growth."
