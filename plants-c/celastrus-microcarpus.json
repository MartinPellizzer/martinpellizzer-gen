It is a climbing shrub that produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters. The plant's fruits are capsule-like structures that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Celastrus microcarpus is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
