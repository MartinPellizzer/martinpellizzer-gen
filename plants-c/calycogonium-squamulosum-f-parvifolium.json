    "intro": "Calycogonium squamulosum f. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved calycogonium, is a rare and lesser-known fern species. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in tropical or subtropical regions. Its leaves are smaller and more compact compared to the typical form of the species, giving it a unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered plant."
