    "intro": "Chimantaea humilis, commonly known as the dwarf chimantaea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chimantaea humilis is considered a rare and endangered species."
