    "intro": "Catasetum colossus, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, with vibrant colors ranging from yellow to orange. The plant produces a unique structure called a \"column,\" which is a specialized reproductive organ found in orchids. Its flowers are pollinated by specific species of bees, which are attracted by the plant's strong fragrance. Catasetum colossus thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
