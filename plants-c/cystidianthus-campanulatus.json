    "intro": "Cystidianthus campanulatus, commonly known as the bell-shaped mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of trees and shrubs. It has small, waxy leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that feed on its fleshy, red berries. This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
