    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 aurantium var. depressa, commonly known as the sour orange. This variety is a citrus hybrid originating from the genus Citrus, characterized by its small, yellow-orange fruits with a thick, aromatic rind. The plant is typically shrub-like, with glossy, dark green leaves and thorned stems. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of citric acid. However, it is less commonly used for fruit consumption due to its tart flavor and high acidity."
