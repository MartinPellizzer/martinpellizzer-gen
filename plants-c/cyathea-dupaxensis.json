    "intro": "Cyathea dupaxensis, commonly known as the Dupax fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its growth and enabling it to store water and nutrients. Cyathea dupaxensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
