    "intro": "Cheirostylis malleifera, commonly known as the woolly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and delicate blooms make it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation. Cheirostylis malleifera plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
