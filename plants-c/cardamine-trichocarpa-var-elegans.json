It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. The species is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates."
