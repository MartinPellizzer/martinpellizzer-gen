It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale green berries that are toxic to animals. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides shelter for certain insects and birds. It is native to parts of southern Africa and is often found in humid, forested environments. Its unique ecological role makes it an important species in its native habitat."
