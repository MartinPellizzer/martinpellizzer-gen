    "intro": "Coelogyne xerophyta, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and hairy, strap-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a red or purple lip. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, shaded environments. Coelogyne xerophyta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
