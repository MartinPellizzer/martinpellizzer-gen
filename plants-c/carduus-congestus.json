    "intro": "Carduus congestus, commonly known as the clustered thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to violet flower heads that consist of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its flowers bloom from late summer to early autumn, and the plant is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Carduus congestus is known for its robust growth and is sometimes considered a weed due to its invasive tendencies in certain regions."
