    "intro": "Cryptantha microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Cryptantha microcarpa is often found in rocky soils and is an important component of desert ecosystems."
