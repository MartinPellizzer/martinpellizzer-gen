    "intro": "Citrullus naudinianus, commonly known as the Naudin's bitter cucumber, is a species of flowering plant in the Cucurbitaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and develops elongated, spiny fruits that contain bitter, pale green to yellowish seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its bitterness, it is not commonly cultivated for food but is of interest in botanical studies."
