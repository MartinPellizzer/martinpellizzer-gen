    "intro": "Cryptantha nubigena, commonly known as the cloudland cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Leguminosae family, which includes many nitrogen-fixing plants. The species is characterized by its delicate, clustered blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are small, linear, and often hairy, adapted to the arid environments it inhabits. Cryptantha nubigena plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
