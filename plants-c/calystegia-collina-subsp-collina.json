It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that open in the morning and close by midday. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds."
