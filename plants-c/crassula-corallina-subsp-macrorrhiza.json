    "intro": "Crassula corallina subsp. macrorrhiza, commonly known as the coral beauty or red crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and fleshy, often red-tinged leaves that are arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
