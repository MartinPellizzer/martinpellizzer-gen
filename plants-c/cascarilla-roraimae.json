    "intro": "Cascarilla roraimae, commonly known as Roraima cascarilla, is a species of flowering plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of shrubs, herbs, and trees. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in the humid, nutrient-poor soils of the highland regions. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species of significant ecological interest."
