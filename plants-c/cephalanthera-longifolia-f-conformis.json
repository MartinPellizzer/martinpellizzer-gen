    "intro": "Cephalanthera longifolia f. conformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its elongated, pale green to yellowish flowers that are clustered in a spike, with a distinctive lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form, giving it its specific epithet \"conformis.\" It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and requires a specific mycorrhizal association for nutrient uptake. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is often protected and requires careful conservation efforts."
