    "intro": "Cinnagrostis rigescens, commonly known as stiff goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright, stiff stems and bright yellow composite flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Cinnagrostis rigescens plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during its flowering period."
