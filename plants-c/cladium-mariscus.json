    "intro": "Cladium mariscus, commonly known as sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland ecosystems in the Americas. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often ribbed and have a sharp, saw-like edge, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that provide habitat for various wildlife species. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, making it an important component of wetland environments. Cladium mariscus plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and water filtration in marshlands."
