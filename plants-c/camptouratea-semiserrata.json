    "intro": "Camptouratea semiserrata, commonly known as the serrated camptouratea, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Asia, particularly found in countries like India, Indonesia, and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a fragrant scent. The plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though scientific validation remains limited."
