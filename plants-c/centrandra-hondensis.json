    "intro": "Centrandra hondensis, commonly known as the Honduran centrandra, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Honduras. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and specialized structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Centrandra hondensis is considered a vulnerable species."
