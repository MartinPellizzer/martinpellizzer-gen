    "intro": "Cleome decipiens, commonly known as spider flower, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is an annual herb that grows up to 2 to 3 meters tall, characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, showy flowers. The flowers are typically pink or white, with five petals and a distinctive central column that resembles a spider's body, giving it its common name. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cleome decipiens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
