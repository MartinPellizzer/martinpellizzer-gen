    "intro": "Cerastium vulgatum subsp. fontanum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, aiding in water retention in harsh environments. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountain meadows and slopes. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in cold, high-altitude conditions make it a characteristic species of alpine flora."
