    "intro": "Convolvulus arvensis var. biflorus, commonly known as the two-flowered field bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its spread through both wind and water dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
