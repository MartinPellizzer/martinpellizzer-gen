    "intro": "Campanula arctolinifolia, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Campanula arctolinifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
