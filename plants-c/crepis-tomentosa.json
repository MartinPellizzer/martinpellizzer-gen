    "intro": "Crepis tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are usually basal, with a dense covering of white or gray hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The flower heads consist of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
