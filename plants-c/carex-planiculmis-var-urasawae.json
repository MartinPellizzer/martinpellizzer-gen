    "intro": "Carex planiculmis var. urasawae, commonly known as the Urasawa sedge, is a variant of the broad-leaved sedge native to Japan. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, cylindrical flower spikes that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
