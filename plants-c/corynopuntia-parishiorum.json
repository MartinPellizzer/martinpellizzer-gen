It is a spiny, branching plant with cylindrical stems that are covered in clusters of small, cylindrical segments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats. Corynopuntia parishiorum plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and small mammals."
