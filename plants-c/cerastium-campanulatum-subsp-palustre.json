    "intro": "Cerastium campanulatum subsp. palustre, commonly known as marsh chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves and stems that help it retain moisture in damp environments. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Its delicate appearance and ecological role in wetland ecosystems make it an important plant for biodiversity."
