    "intro": "Cephalangraecum gentilii, commonly known as the Cape mountain cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, a feature typical of cycads, and it has a slow growth rate. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
