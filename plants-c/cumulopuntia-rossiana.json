    "intro": "Cumulopuntia rossiana, commonly known as the Ross's cactus, is a species of flowering plant in the cactus family, Cactaceae. It is native to the arid regions of northern Mexico, particularly in the states of Chihuahua and Coahuila. The plant is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 5 meters in height, covered in dense, white spines. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom in late summer and early autumn. Cumulopuntia rossiana is well adapted to desert conditions, with a deep root system and the ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems."
