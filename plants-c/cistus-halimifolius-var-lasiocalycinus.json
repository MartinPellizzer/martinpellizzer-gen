    "intro": "Cistus halimifolius var. lasiocalycinus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, evergreen leaves that are typically narrow and linear, with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
