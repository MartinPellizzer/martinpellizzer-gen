    "intro": "Caruelina spinosa, commonly known as the spiny caruelina, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Caruelina spinosa is adapted to survive in dry environments, with a deep root system and waxy leaves to reduce water loss. It is often found in rocky soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
