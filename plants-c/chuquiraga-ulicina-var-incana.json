    "intro": "Chuquiraga ulicina var. incana, commonly known as the white chuquiraga, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its silver-gray, fuzzy foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
