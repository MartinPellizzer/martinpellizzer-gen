    "intro": "Centaurea eriopoda, commonly known as the woolly centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Centaurea eriopoda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
