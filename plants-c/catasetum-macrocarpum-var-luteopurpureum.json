    "intro": "Catasetum macrocarpum var. luteopurpureum, commonly known as the purple-tinged yellow orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that display a mix of yellow and purple hues, often with a distinctive orange or red lip. The plant produces a unique structure called a \"catasetum,\" which is a specialized pollen presenter used in pollination. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. The flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, making it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
