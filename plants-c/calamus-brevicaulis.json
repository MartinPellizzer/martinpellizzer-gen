    "intro": "Calamus brevicaulis, commonly known as the short-stemmed calamus, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to Southeast Asia. It is a slender, herbaceous plant that typically grows in wet, swampy areas or along the edges of water bodies. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with numerous upright, narrow leaves that are often arched or curved. Its flowers are small and clustered in spadices, typical of many palms, and it produces dark, elongated fruits. Calamus brevicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens."
