    "intro": "Chrysopogon gryllus subsp. echinulatus, commonly known as the roughhair grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish to brownish flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, often forming dense mats. Its fibrous roots make it an important component of soil stabilization in arid environments."
