    "intro": "Cunonia pulchella f. paucifoliolata, commonly known as the rare leafy form of the common cunonia, is a variant of the species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its reduced foliage, with fewer and smaller leaves compared to the typical form. The plant belongs to the Rutaceae family and is known for its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in spring. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and horticulture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
