    "intro": "Caladium edule, commonly known as the arrowhead vine, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to variegated patterns of white and pink. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. Its tubers, which are edible when properly cooked, are a traditional food source in some indigenous communities. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade."
