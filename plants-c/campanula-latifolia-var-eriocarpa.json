It is characterized by its hairy, woolly stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Campanula latifolia var. eriocarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates."
