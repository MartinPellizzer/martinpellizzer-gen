    "intro": "Cyclophorus borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean cyclophorus, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant has elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
