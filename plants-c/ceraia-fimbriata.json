    "intro": "Ceraia fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed sea hare, is a species of sea slug found in tropical and subtropical marine environments. It belongs to the family Aeplysiidae and is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and distinctive fringed mantle. The plant-like appearance of the fringed sea hare is due to its leafy, branched gills and the presence of a mantle that can resemble plant structures. It is primarily herbivorous, feeding on algae and other marine plants, which contributes to its ecological role in coastal ecosystems. The species is notable for its ability to change color and its role in the food web of marine environments."
