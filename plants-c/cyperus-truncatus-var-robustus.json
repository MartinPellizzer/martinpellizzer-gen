    "intro": "Cyperus truncatus var. robustus, commonly known as the broadleaf paperplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features tall, upright stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often with a fibrous, spongy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stems. Its leaves are typically broad, flat, and blade-like, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in moist environments."
