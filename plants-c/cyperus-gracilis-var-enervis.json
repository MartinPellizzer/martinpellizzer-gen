It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, often with three stamens and a single pistil. Cyperus gracilis var. enervis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
