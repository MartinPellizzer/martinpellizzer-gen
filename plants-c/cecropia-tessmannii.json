    "intro": "Cecropia tessmannii, commonly known as the giant cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its large, simple leaves and striking, showy inflorescences. The plant has a unique relationship with ants, providing them with shelter and food in exchange for protection against herbivores. Its hollow stems and rapid growth make it an important species in ecological studies and reforestation projects. The plant's adaptability to disturbed habitats contributes to its widespread distribution in the Neotropics."
