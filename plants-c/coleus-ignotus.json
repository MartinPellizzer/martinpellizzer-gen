    "intro": "Coleus ignotus, commonly known as the unknown coleus, is a member of the Lamiaceae family, known for its vibrant and diverse foliage. Native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant is characterized by its striking, often variegated leaves that come in shades of green, white, and red. It thrives in warm, humid environments and prefers well-draining soil with partial to full sunlight. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly in gardens and indoor settings. Its foliage can be used in traditional herbal medicine, though its medicinal properties are less well-documented compared to other coleus species."
