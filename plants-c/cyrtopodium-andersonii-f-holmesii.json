    "intro": "Cyrtopodium andersonii f. holmesii, commonly known as the Holmes' corycium, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The flowers are striking, featuring a single, showy bloom with a dark, velvety lip and a contrasting white and green sepals. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native range."
