    "intro": "Cypripedium binotii, commonly known as the two-banded lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or white with a yellow or green throat. The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome and produces a single, erect stem that bears a single flower. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often arranged in a basal rosette. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Cypripedium binotii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
