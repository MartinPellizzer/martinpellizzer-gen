    "intro": "Conophytum primosii, commonly known as the \"Lion's Tail\" or \"Cape Plume,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, upright spikes of yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal watering. Conophytum primosii is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
