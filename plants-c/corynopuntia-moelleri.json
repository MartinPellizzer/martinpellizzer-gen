    "intro": "Corynopuntia moelleri, commonly known as the Moeller's cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in small, spine-tipped bristles, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in inflorescences at the ends of the stems. Its growth habit is typically clumping, forming dense, low-growing shrubs adapted to arid environments. Corynopuntia moelleri is well-suited to harsh desert conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
