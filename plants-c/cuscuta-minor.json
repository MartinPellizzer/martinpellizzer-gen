    "intro": "Cuscuta minor, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its host to extract water and nutrients. The plant is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are tiny and can remain dormant in the soil for years, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host and reduce crop yields if left unchecked."
