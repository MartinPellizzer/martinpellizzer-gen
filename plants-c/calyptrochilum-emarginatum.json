    "intro": "Calyptrochilum emarginatum, commonly known as the emarginate calyptrochilum, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a lip that is distinctly emarginate, or notched, which is a key identifying trait. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and pale, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
