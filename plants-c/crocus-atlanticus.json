It features showy, early spring blooms with bright yellow petals and a distinctive, three-lobed tepal structure. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or sandy habitats. Its bulbs are adapted to survive harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. The Atlantic crocus is an important indicator species for coastal ecosystems and is valued for its ornamental beauty."
