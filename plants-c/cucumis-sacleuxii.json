It is native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East, where it thrives in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, elongated fruits that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. This species is adapted to low water conditions, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping and sustainable gardening."
