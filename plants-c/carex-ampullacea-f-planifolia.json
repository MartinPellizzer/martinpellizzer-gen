    "intro": "Carex ampullacea f. planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaved bulbous sedge, is a variant of the bulbous sedge species native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, flat leaves that are often arranged in dense, compact clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
