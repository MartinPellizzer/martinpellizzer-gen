    "intro": "Crataegus germanica, commonly known as the German hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Crataegus germanica is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and open areas with well-drained soil. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in botanical studies."
