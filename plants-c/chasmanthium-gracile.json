    "intro": "Chasmanthium gracile, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often less than 10 centimeters in length. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its preference for wet environments, it is often used in wetland restoration projects."
