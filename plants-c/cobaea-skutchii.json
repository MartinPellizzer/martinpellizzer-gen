The plant typically grows as a climbing vine, reaching lengths of up to 10 meters, with heart-shaped leaves and strong, twining stems. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Cobaea skutchii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
