    "intro": "Casearia minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf casearia, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release tiny seeds. Casearia minutiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its compact size and foliage."
