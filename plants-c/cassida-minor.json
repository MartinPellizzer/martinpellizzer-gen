    "intro": "Cassida minor, commonly known as the lesser leaf beetle, is a small, herbivorous beetle belonging to the family Chrysomelidae. It is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it feeds on various plants, particularly in the family Malvaceae. The beetle's life cycle involves laying eggs on host plants, which hatch into larvae that feed on leaves. Its presence can sometimes lead to defoliation, impacting the health of the host plant. The species is notable for its metallic green or blue coloration, which serves as a form of camouflage in its natural habitat."
