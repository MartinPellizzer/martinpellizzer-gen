    "intro": "Carvi, commonly known as caraway, is an aromatic annual herb native to Europe and western Asia. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers and has slender, branched stems. The plant's seeds, which are often used in culinary and medicinal applications, are enclosed in a hairy, three-lobed capsule. Carvi thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its essential oils, derived from the seeds, contain compounds like limonene and carvone, contributing to its distinctive flavor and aroma."
