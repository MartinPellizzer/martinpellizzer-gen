    "intro": "Cleistanthus nokrensis, commonly known as the Nokren\u2019s cleistanthus, is a rare shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas. Its botanical features include a woody stem, simple leaves with a smooth margin, and yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cyathia. Due to habitat loss, Cleistanthus nokrensis is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
