    "intro": "Caladium reichenbachii, commonly known as the flameleaf caladium, is a tropical perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful, heart-shaped leaves that come in shades of red, orange, and white. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and partial to full shade. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Caladium reichenbachii is often grown as a bedding plant or in containers due to its short growing season in cooler climates."
