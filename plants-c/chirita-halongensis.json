    "intro": "Chirita halongensis, commonly known as the Halong chiretta, is a species of flowering plant in the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to Vietnam, specifically the coastal areas around Halong Bay, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It is often found growing in rocky or shaded environments near the coast. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
