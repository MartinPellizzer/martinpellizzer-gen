    "intro": "Caltha riparia, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has slender, hairy stems that often grow in clusters, and its leaves are alternate, with a distinctive heart-shaped base. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found along stream banks and marshy areas. Caltha riparia plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil with its fibrous root system."
