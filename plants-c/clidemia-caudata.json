    "intro": "Clidemia caudata, commonly known as the hairy beggar's-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, with opposite, hairy leaves that are often glandular. It produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by small, woody fruits called cypsela. Clidemia caudata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
