It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots. The plant features a large, crown of feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea amazonica thrives in humid, shaded environments and plays a significant role in the ecological structure of the rainforest. Its unique morphology and ecological importance make it an important component of the Amazonian flora."
