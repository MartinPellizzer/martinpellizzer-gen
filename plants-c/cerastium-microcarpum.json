It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes carnations and other flowering plants. The plant features small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its seeds are enclosed in small, capsule-like structures, which aid in its dispersal."
