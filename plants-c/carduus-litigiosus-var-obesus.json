    "intro": "Carduus litigiosus var. obesus, commonly known as the fat thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, hairy leaves that are typically lobed and covered in white or grayish down. The plant produces purple to pink flower heads that consist of many small florets, which are surrounded by bracts. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
