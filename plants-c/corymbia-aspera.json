    "intro": "Corymbia aspera, commonly known as the rough-barked apple, is a species of flowering tree native to northern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels away in strips. The tree produces small, white flowers that are clustered in groups, followed by woody, edible fruits. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Corymbia aspera is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
