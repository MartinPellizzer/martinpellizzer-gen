    "intro": "Cestrum chaculanum, commonly known as the Chacul\u00e1n nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries are small, red, and edible, though they contain toxic compounds. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some indigenous communities."
