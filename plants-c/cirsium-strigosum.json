    "intro": "Cirsium strigosum, commonly known as the rough thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 60\u2013120 cm, with grey-green, woolly foliage and purple to pinkish flower heads. Its leaves are covered in stiff, barbed hairs, which deter herbivores and aid in water retention. Cirsium strigosum is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
