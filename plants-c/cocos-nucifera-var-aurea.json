    "intro": "Cocos nucifera var. aurea, commonly known as the golden coconut palm, is a variant of the coconut tree native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces coconuts that are typically smaller and have a sweeter, more aromatic flavor compared to the common coconut. Its ornamental value makes it popular in landscaping and coastal gardens. The tree thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil and full sunlight."
