    "intro": "Combretum celastroides subsp. laxiflorum, commonly known as the slender-flowered combretum, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often pubescent and have a distinctive elliptical shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forest understories or along riverbanks."
