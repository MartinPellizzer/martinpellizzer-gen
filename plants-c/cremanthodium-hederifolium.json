    "intro": "Cremanthodium hederifolium, commonly known as the ivy-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Crambeaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of ivy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
