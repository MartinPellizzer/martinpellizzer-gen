    "intro": "Carex japonica variegata-nova, commonly known as the Variegated Japanese Sedge, is a perennial plant native to East Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with striking variegation, often displaying white and green patterns. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and ability to form dense, low-maintenance ground covers."
