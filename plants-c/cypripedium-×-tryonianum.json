    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 tryonianum, commonly known as the Tryon's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid that exhibits a blend of characteristics from its parent species. It is a perennial herb with a distinctive, showy flower that resembles a slipper, featuring a pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, large, fragrant bloom during the spring or early summer. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
