    "intro": "Cyrtochilum garayi, commonly known as the Garay's slipper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant features a pseudobulb-like structure and produces green, strap-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy pubescence. Cyrtochilum garayi is noted for its unique floral morphology, with petals that curve inward, forming a distinctive \"slipper\" shape. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
