    "intro": "Codonorchis canisioi, commonly known as the Canisio's\u6753\u5170, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a yellow lip and a white or greenish upper sepal. The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats, often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Its growth is slow, and it requires specific soil conditions rich in organic matter. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
