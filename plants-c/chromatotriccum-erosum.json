It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water. Its flowers are typically pink or red, arranged in clusters, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Chromatotriccum erosum is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
