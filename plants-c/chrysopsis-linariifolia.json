    "intro": "Chrysopsis linariifolia, commonly known as the slender everlasting or narrowleaf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and a compact, mat-forming growth habit. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its long-lasting flowers and ability to attract pollinators."
