    "intro": "Clidemia foveolata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences with five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Clidemia foveolata is also known for its ability to form dense thickets, which can make it an invasive species in certain areas."
