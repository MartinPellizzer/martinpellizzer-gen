    "intro": "Castanea vesca var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are smaller and more delicate compared to those of the common horse chestnut. The tree produces spiny husks that enclose bright orange-red seeds, which are edible when fully mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The flowers are white and clustered in panicles, adding to its aesthetic appeal in spring."
