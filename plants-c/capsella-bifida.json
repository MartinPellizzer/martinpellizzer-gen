It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like mustard and cabbage. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring hairy stems and alternate, heart-shaped leaves. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters and are followed by distinctive triangular pods that split open to release the seeds. Capsella bifida is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
