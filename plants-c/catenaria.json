    "intro": "Catenaria, commonly known as the chain plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its unique, cascading inflorescence that resembles a chain, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is well-adapted to sandy soils and salty air. Catenaria species are often found in the Mediterranean region and along the coasts of southern Europe, Africa, and South America. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense, hanging clusters that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
