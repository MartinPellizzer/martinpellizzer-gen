    "intro": "Cedrela boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian cedar, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America, particularly in Bolivia, Peru, and Brazil. It belongs to the Meliaceae family, which includes mahogany and other valuable hardwoods. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a broad, umbrella-shaped crown. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated margin, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
