It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or brown in color. Cyrtonema foetens is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woods. It is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
