    "intro": "Cousinia calva, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb with a robust root system that allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant features slender, upright stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Cousinia calva plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
