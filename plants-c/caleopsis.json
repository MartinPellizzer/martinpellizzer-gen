    "intro": "Caleopsis, commonly known as the \"buttercup grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. These plants are native to North America and are often found in prairie and disturbed soils. They are herbaceous perennials with slender stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. Caleopsis species are valued for their ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for pollinators."
