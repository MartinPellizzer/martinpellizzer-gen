    "intro": "Calceolaria cuzcoensis, commonly known as the Cuzco slipper, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Peru. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking, slipper-shaped flowers that range in color from purple to yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its native habitat. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds, which are attracted to its nectar-rich blooms. Calceolaria cuzcoensis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural significance in Andean communities."
