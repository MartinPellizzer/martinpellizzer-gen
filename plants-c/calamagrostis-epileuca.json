    "intro": "Calamagrostis epileuca, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It features slender, silver-gray blades with a bluish hue, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems are tall and cylindrical, producing small, spike-like clusters of pale blue to purple flowers in the summer. Calamagrostis epileuca is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
