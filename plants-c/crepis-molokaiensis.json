    "intro": "Crepis molokaiensis, commonly known as Molokai's mouse-ear, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Molokai. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and yellow flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. It is a short-lived perennial with a compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
