    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis subsp. dentata, commonly known as the toothed water-crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist meadows and wetlands in Europe. It features basal leaves that are divided into three parts, with the central leaflet being prominently toothed, giving it its subspecies name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a dense, upright cluster. It thrives in nutrient-rich, calcareous soils and is often found in riparian habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
