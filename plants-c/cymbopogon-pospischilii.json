    "intro": "Cymbopogon pospischilii, commonly known as the Himalayan lemongrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, lemon-scented leaves that contain high concentrations of citral, a compound responsible for its distinctive fragrance. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender, tufted foliage that thrives in well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its essential oils, which are used in aromatherapy and traditional medicine. The flowering stems produce small, pale green to brown spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family."
