It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has slender, triangular stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like in appearance. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually pale green to brown in color. Cyperus boreobellus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
