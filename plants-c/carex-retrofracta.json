    "intro": "Carex retrofracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a species of sedge native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and stabilize soil. Carex retrofracta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
