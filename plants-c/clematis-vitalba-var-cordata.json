    "intro": "Clematis vitalba var. cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf Clematis, is a vigorous climbing vine native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It features heart-shaped, palmate leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in many regions."
