    "intro": "Cassytha micrantha, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true roots and chlorophyll. It attaches itself to a host plant using haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and has slender, winding stems that can grow along the surface of the host. It is native to various regions in Asia and is often found on plants such as legumes and grasses. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
