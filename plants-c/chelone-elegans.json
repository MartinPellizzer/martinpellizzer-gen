    "intro": "Chelone elegans, commonly known as turtlehead, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular flowers that resemble a turtle's head, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or wetlands. Chelone elegans is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees."
