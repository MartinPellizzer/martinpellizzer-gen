It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in open, sandy habitats and is often found in coastal areas. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by narrow, curved pods containing seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
