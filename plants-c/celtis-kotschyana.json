    "intro": "Celtis kotschyana, commonly known as the small-leaved hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ulmaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, round berries that are edible for some bird species. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Celtis kotschyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging ecological conditions."
