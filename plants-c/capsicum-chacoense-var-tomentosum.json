It is characterized by its small, elongated fruits that range in color from green to red when mature. The plant typically grows in dry, arid environments and has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are yellow and bilaterally symmetrical, typical of the Solanaceae family. The fruit is used in traditional medicine and has a mild, peppery flavor."
