    "intro": "Centropodia forskaolii subsp. persica, commonly known as the Persian centropodia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
