    "intro": "Cassebeera viridis, commonly known as the green cassava, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, palm-like leaves and a thick, starchy root that is used as a food source. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Cassebeera viridis is also valued for its ornamental appeal due to its vibrant green foliage."
