    "intro": "Centaurea polyacantha var. adpressa, commonly known as the creeping centaury, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, often prostrate stems that form dense mats, and its small, bright blue or purple flowers bloom in summer. The leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
