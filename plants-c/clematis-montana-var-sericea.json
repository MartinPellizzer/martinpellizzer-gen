    "intro": "Clematis montana var. sericea, commonly known as the silver weeping clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems that can grow up to 15 meters in length, making it suitable for trellises or arbors. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a silvery-white underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
