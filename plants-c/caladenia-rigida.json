    "intro": "Caladenia rigida, commonly known as the rigid spider-orchid, is an endemic Australian plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and its distinctive, spider-like flowers with a single, elongated labellum. The plant typically grows in heathland and open forests, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Caladenia rigida is known for its delicate, pale green to brownish flowers that bloom from late summer to autumn. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and threatened species in some regions."
