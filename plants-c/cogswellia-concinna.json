    "intro": "Cogswellia concinna, commonly known as the dwarf zebra cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and distinctive ribbed structure, which helps it conserve water in its natural habitat. The plant produces yellow flowers during the cooler months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. Its fleshy stems are covered in small, white spines that provide protection from herbivores. Cogswellia concinna is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
