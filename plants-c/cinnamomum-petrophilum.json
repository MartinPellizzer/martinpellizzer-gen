    "intro": "Cinnamomum petrophilum, commonly known as the rock cinnamon, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its aromatic, woody bark and small, clustered leaves that are typically dark green in color. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Its essential oils, derived from the bark, are valued for their medicinal and aromatic properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cinnamomum petrophilum is considered a conservation concern."
