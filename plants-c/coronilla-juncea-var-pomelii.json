    "intro": "Coronilla juncea var. pomelii, commonly known as the Pomelii vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a trailing growth habit and produces slender, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
