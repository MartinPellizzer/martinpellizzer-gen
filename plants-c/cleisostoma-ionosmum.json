    "intro": "Cleisostoma ionosmum, commonly known as the violet moon orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features showy, violet-colored flowers with a unique, moon-like appearance. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are epiphytic, allowing it to grow on tree trunks in its natural habitat. The flowers typically bloom during the dry season, attracting specific pollinators like bees and wasps."
