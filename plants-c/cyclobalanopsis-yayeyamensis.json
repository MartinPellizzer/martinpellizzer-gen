    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis yayeyamensis, commonly known as the Yae-yama chinquapin, is a rare evergreen tree native to the island of Kyushu in Japan. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spiny, cup-like structures that enclose its edible seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within subtropical forests and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
