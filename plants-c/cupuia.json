    "intro": "Cupuia, commonly known as the Brazilian cupuia or cupuia tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and includes several species that are often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically yellow or white. Cupuia species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fruit is a capsule that contains small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
