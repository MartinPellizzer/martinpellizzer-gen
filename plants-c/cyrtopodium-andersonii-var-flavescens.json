    "intro": "Cyrtopodium andersonii var. flavescens, commonly known as the golden-flowered lady's slipper, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, yellowish-orange flowers that resemble a lady's slipper, with a pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often forming a rosette near the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
