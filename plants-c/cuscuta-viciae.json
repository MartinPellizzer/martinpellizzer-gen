    "intro": "Cuscuta viciae, commonly known as the field dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive appearance with thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is commonly found on legumes such as vetch, which serve as its primary hosts. Cuscuta viciae is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and agricultural fields. Its life cycle involves germinating on host seeds and establishing a parasitic relationship through specialized root-like structures called haustoria."
