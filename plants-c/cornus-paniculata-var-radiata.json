    "intro": "Cornus paniculata var. radiata, commonly known as the Chinese dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking white bracts that form an umbrella-like inflorescence, which becomes more prominent as the plant matures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered within the bracts, and its leaves are ovate with serrated edges. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. This ornamental plant is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in gardens for its seasonal interest."
