It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by edible, chestnut-like fruits that are important for wildlife. Its ecological significance lies in its ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates, contributing to forest biodiversity. The species is also valued for its durable timber, which has been used traditionally in construction and craftsmanship."
