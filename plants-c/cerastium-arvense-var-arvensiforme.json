    "intro": "Cerastium arvense var. arvensiforme, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively in disturbed soils. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, rounded, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. It is often found in meadows, fields, and along roadsides, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich environments."
