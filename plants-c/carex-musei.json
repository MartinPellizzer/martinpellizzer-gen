    "intro": "Carex musei, commonly known as the museum sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Native to temperate regions, Carex musei thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. The plant's rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
