    "intro": "Chrysocephalum apiculatum subsp. orarium, commonly known as the golden crown bush, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow flowers that bloom in dense, spherical clusters. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salty air. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value. The subspecies orarium is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to other forms of Chrysocephalum apiculatum."
