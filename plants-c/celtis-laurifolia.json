    "intro": "Celtis laurifolia, commonly known as the sweet gum or water laurier, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and purple in the fall. The tree produces small, spherical fruits that are encased in a star-shaped, spiky husk. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age. Celtis laurifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in woodland areas."
