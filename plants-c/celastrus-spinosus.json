    "intro": "Celastrus spinosus, commonly known as prickly nightshade, is a deciduous climbing vine native to North America. It features compound leaves with spiny margins and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the summer. The plant bears orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, often forming dense thickets. Its botanical characteristics make it both ecologically significant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
