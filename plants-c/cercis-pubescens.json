    "intro": "Cercis pubescens, commonly known as the downy redbud, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking clusters of pink to purple flowers that appear before the leaves in early spring. The plant has smooth, gray-brown bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its small, oval-shaped leaves are covered in fine, downy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Cercis pubescens is well-suited for ornamental landscaping due to its early blooming habit and compact size."
