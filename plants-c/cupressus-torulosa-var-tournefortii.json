    "intro": "Cupressus torulosa var. tournefortii, commonly known as the Mediterranean cypress, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the Mediterranean region. It features scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and silvery-white underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by cylindrical cones. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its dense, pyramidal shape and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
