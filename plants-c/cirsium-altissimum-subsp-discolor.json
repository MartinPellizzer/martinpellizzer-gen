    "intro": "Cirsium altissimum subsp. discolor, commonly known as the purple stem thistle, is a tall, perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple-tinged stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, showy purple or pink flowers in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in prairies and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a subject of ecological study."
