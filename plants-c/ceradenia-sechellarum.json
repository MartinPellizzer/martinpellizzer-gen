    "intro": "Ceradenia sechellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles ceradenia, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the Seychelles. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive white throat. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on limestone substrates. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
