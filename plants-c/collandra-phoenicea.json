    "intro": "Collandra phoenicea, commonly known as the golden sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low, spreading growth habit and bright yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Its leaves are succulent, helping it store water, while its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Collandra phoenicea is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
