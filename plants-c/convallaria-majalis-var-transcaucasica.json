It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, with a subtle fragrance. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and woodland settings. This variety is closely related to the more widely known Convallaria majalis, but it exhibits distinct morphological characteristics."
