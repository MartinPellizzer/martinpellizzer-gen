    "intro": "Cystopteris filix-fragilis, commonly known as the brittle fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has fronds that are bipinnate, with a finely divided, feathery appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The species is characterized by its fragile, often papery texture, which gives it its common name."
