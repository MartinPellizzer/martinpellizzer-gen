    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris reuteri, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It features small, white flowers with four petals and hairy, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, round seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, lawns, and along pathways. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in many temperate regions."
