    "intro": "Cycas acuminatissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being ovoid and woody. Cycas acuminatissima is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
