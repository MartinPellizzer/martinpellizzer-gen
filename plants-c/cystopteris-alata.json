    "intro": "Cystopteris alata, commonly known as the spreading water fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. The plant's fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, feathery appearance. Cystopteris alata reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in aquatic and bog gardens."
