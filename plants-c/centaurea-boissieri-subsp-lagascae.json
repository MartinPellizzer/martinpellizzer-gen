It typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often in mountainous areas. The plant features bright blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
