    "intro": "Cyclosorus multilineatus, commonly known as the multilined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures, including sporocarps, are borne on short stalks and contain spores for propagation. Cyclosorus multilineatus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
