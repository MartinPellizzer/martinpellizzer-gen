    "intro": "Castilleja bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant has specialized roots that attach to the roots of other plants, allowing it to absorb nutrients from its host. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Castilleja bracteata plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar to pollinators like bees and butterflies."
