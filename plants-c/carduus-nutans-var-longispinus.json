    "intro": "Carduus nutans var. longispinus, commonly known as the long-spined sow-thistle, is a variant of the common sow-thistle. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its erect, spiny stems and lobed, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Due to its spines and robust growth, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
