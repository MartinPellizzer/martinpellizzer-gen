    "intro": "Costus montanus, commonly known as the mountain costus, is a tropical perennial plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes ginger and turmeric, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy inflorescences. The plant produces striking, colorful bract-like flowers that range from yellow to red, often arranged in a spiral pattern. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense clumps in suitable habitats. Costus montanus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a source of essential oils."
