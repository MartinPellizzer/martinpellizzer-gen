It features basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often hairy and can grow up to 60 centimeters in height. Campanula sclerotricha is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and wildflower meadows."
