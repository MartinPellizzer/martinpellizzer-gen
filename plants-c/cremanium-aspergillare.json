It is characterized by its robust, wiry stems and lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate rainforests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Cremanium aspergillare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
