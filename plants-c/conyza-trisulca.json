    "intro": "Conyza trisulca, commonly known as the three-rayed weed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in open areas such as roadsides and fields. Its small, white flowers are arranged in a cluster, and it produces fluffy seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. Conyza trisulca is often considered a weed but has some medicinal uses in traditional herbal practices."
