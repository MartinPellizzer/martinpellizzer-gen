    "intro": "Cyrtochilum undulatum, commonly known as the wavy orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, often pendulous growth habit and its showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, yellow, and orange. The plant features a pseudobulb system, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with periods of drought. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its overall resilience. Cyrtochilum undulatum is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
