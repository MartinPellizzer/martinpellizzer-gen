    "intro": "Cnicus costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features bright yellow flowers with five petals, arranged in a cluster at the end of each stem. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cnicus costaricensis plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
