    "intro": "Changnienia malipoensis, commonly known as the Malipo cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and relies on insect pollination for reproduction. Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it a critically endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
