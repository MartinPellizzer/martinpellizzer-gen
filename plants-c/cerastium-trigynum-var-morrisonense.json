    "intro": "Cerastium trigynum var. morrisonense, commonly known as Morrison's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the British Isles. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in parts of its native range."
