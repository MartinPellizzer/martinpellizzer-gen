    "intro": "Callitriche elegans f. inundata, commonly known as the water starwort, is a semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has small, floating or submerged leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. Its flowers are typically small and white or pale pink, appearing in clusters at the water's surface. This subspecies is characterized by its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels and is often found in disturbed aquatic environments."
