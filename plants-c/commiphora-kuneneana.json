    "intro": "Commiphora kuneneana, commonly known as the Kwenene tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh-producing plants. The tree is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and leathery, elliptical leaves that are often arranged in pairs. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by fragrant, resinous gum that exudes from its bark. This resin has been traditionally used for medicinal and aromatic purposes by local communities."
