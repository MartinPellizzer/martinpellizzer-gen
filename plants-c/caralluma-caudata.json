    "intro": "Caralluma caudata, commonly known as the Candelabra Fig or Desert Candelabra, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its branching, cylindrical stems that often resemble a candlestick, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Caralluma caudata is well adapted to harsh environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
