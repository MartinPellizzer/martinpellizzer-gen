It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters. The plant produces small, round, yellow fruits that are similar in appearance to lemons but have a more aromatic and less acidic flavor. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and the plant is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Citrus ryukyuensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional Japanese cuisine and medicine."
