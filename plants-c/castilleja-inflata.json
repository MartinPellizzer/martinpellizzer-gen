    "intro": "Castilleja inflata, commonly known as the inflated milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Castilleja inflata is often found in association with grasses and shrubs, contributing to the ecological diversity of its environment."
