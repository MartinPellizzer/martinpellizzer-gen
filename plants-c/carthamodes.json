    "intro": "Carthamodes, commonly known as the \"Chinese evergreen\" or \"Rohitak,\" is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy yellow or orange inflorescences. The plant features lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a waxy texture, which help it thrive in humid environments. Carthamodes is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its ability to grow in shaded areas makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, shade-tolerant plants."
