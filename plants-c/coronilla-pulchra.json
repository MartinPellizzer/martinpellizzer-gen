    "intro": "Coronilla pulchra, commonly known as the pretty crown vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is known for its deep root system, which helps it thrive in poor soils and makes it a useful plant for erosion control. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, facilitating its propagation. Coronilla pulchra is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
