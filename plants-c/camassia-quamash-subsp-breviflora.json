    "intro": "Camassia quamash subsp. breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered camas, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist meadows and woodland areas, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features grass-like basal leaves and produces showy blue to violet flowers in early spring. Its bulbs are edible and have been traditionally used by Indigenous peoples. This subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more compact flower spikes compared to other camas varieties."
