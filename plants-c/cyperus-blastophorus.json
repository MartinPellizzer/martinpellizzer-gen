It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical spikes of small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and shallow waters, where it forms dense stands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it often grows in muddy or saturated soils. Cyperus blastophorus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
