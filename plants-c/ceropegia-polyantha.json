    "intro": "Ceropegia polyantha, commonly known as the coral vine, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces unique, nectar-rich flowers that attract specific pollinators, such as certain species of flies and beetles. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Ceropegia polyantha is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and delicate blooms."
