It is characterized by its large, spiny leaves and thick, edible stems that are often used in cooking. The plant produces large, purple flower heads that are similar to those of the common artichoke but are typically not consumed. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun for optimal growth. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and potential culinary use."
