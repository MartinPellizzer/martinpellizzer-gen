    "intro": "Ceriscoides imbakensis, commonly known as the Imbak River ceris, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
