    "intro": "Capsicum frutescens var. pendulum, commonly known as the hanging pepper or cascade pepper, is a compact, bushy plant with trailing stems that produce small, ornamental flowers. It is native to South America and is often cultivated for its decorative value rather than its fruit. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 cm, with its pendulous growth habit making it ideal for hanging baskets or containers. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and the fruit, when mature, can be red, yellow, or orange. This variety is well-suited for warm climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun."
