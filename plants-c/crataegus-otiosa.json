    "intro": "Crataegus otiosa, commonly known as the white thornapple, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and showy white to pink flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits known as pomes, which are typically eaten by birds and small mammals. Crataegus otiosa is often found in open woods, thickets, and along stream banks, thriving in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of native ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
