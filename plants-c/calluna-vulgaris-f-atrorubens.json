    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris f. atrorubens, commonly known as the dark red heather, is a horticultural form of the common heather. It is characterized by its striking dark red to almost black flowers, which contrast with its dense, evergreen foliage. This variety thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-growing mats. The plant is also valued for its resilience and ability to attract pollinators."
