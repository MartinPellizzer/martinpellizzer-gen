    "intro": "Calyptranthes tenuipes, commonly known as the slender-leaf calyptranthes, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-gray pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. These flowers are followed by small, oval-shaped fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. Calyptranthes tenuipes is well adapted to coastal climates and is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils along the shoreline."
