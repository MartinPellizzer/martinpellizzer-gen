    "intro": "Ceratopyxis, commonly known as the horned bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey, which are typically tiny aquatic invertebrates. Ceratopyxis species are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. They have root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor them to substrates, and their leaves are usually filamentous or branched. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in ecological studies due to their unique adaptations and role in aquatic ecosystems."
