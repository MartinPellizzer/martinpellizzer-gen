    "intro": "Calligonum acanthopterum var. subnudum, commonly known as the coastal tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, gray-green foliage that is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. The plant produces small, pinkish flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind or insects. Its roots are extensive and capable of stabilizing sandy soils, making it an important species for dune fixation. This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaf pubescence compared to other varieties of Calligonum acanthopterum."
