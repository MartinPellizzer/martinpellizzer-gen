    "intro": "Calcitrapa pyracantha, commonly known as the firethorn, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of bright orange to red berries that persist through winter. The plant's leaves are oval-shaped, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, appearing in spring before the leaves emerge. Calcitrapa pyracantha is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and berries."
