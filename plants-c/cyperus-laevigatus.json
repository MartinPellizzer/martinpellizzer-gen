    "intro": "Cyperus laevigatus, commonly known as flatleaf sedges, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, triangular stems with smooth, waxy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Its small, clustered flowers are usually green or brown, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. Cyperus laevigatus is often used in ornamental gardening and can also serve as a natural indicator of wetland conditions."
