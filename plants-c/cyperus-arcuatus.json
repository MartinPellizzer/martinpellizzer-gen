    "intro": "Cyperus arcuatus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and distinctive, umbrella-shaped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Cyperus arcuatus is also used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant in landscaping."
