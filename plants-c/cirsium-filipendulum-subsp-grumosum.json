    "intro": "Cirsium filipendulum subsp. grumosum, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and spiny, purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in a thick layer of white to greyish hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
