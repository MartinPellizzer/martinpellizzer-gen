    "intro": "Clidemiastrum, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Clidemiastrum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests and wetlands. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some tropical gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
