It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its grass-like appearance features narrow, strap-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in late spring to early summer. Carex toroensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
