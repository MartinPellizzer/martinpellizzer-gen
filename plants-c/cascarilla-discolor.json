    "intro": "Cascarilla discolor, commonly known as the yellow wood or yellow sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by fruiting bodies that contain winged seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and on limestone soils. The plant is valued for its aromatic wood, which has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
