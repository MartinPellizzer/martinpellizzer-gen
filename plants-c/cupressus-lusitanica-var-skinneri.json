    "intro": "Cupressus lusitanica var. skinneri, commonly known as the Skinner's lacebark, is a variant of the Portuguese cypress. It is characterized by its finely textured, feathery foliage and distinctive, exfoliating bark that reveals a mottled pattern of green and white. Native to the Iberian Peninsula, this evergreen conifer thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. The plant is relatively slow-growing and can reach heights of up to 10 meters."
