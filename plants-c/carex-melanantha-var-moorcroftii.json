    "intro": "Carex melanantha var. moorcroftii, commonly known as the Moorcroft sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a tight, cylindrical cluster. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and shaded forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
