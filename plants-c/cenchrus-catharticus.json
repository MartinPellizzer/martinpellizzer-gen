    "intro": "Cenchrus catharticus, commonly known as the cat's-tail grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and distinctive, tufted inflorescence that resembles a cat's tail. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and rigid, with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Cenchrus catharticus is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
