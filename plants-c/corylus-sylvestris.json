    "intro": "Corylus sylvestris, commonly known as the European hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Betulaceae and is characterized by its clustered, oval-shaped leaves and edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. The plant produces both male and female flowers on the same individual, with the male flowers appearing as yellow catkins in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitats. The hazelnuts are an important food source for various birds and small mammals."
