    "intro": "Camaridium arbuscula, commonly known as the tree of heaven, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 3 to 5 pairs of ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. It has a deep root system that can make it difficult to eradicate once established. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a persistent weed in agricultural and natural areas."
