    "intro": "Chondropis trinervia, commonly known as the three-veined fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with fine, thread-like pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. Chondropis trinervia is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
