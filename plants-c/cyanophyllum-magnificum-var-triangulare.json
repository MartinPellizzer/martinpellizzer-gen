    "intro": "Cyanophyllum magnificum var. triangulare, commonly known as the Triangular Bluebloom, is a unique flowering plant characterized by its striking blue petals and triangular leaf shape. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically broad and have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
