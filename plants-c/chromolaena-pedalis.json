    "intro": "Chromolaena pedalis, commonly known as the creeping chromolaena, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and can form dense mats, often invading disturbed areas. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy and have a slightly serrated edge. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in clusters and are followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Chromolaena pedalis is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
