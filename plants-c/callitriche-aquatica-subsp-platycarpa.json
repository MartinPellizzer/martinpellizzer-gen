It has small, oval leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that are often submerged or just at the water's surface. It is often found in slow-moving or still waters such as ponds and marshes. Its presence indicates good water quality and is important for aquatic ecosystems."
