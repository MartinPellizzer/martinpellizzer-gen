    "intro": "Castanea montana, commonly known as the Chinese sweet chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces catkin-like male flowers and female flowers that develop into spiny, chestnut-like fruits. The fruits contain one or two edible seeds enclosed in a prickly husk. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions."
