    "intro": "Clidemia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, aiding in its propagation. Clidemia angustifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
