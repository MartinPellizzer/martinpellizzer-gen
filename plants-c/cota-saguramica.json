    "intro": "Cota saguramica, commonly known as the golden cota, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cota saguramica is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
