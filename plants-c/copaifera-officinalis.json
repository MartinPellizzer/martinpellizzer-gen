    "intro": "Copaifera officinalis, commonly known as Brazilian copaiba, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. It is characterized by its aromatic, resinous sap, which has been traditionally used in medicine and perfumery. The plant belongs to the family Leguminosae (Fabaceae) and is known for its large, compound leaves and showy, yellowish flowers. Its bark and resin are rich in compounds such as alpha- and beta-copaene, which contribute to its medicinal properties. Copaifera officinalis is also valued for its ecological role in tropical rainforests and its potential in sustainable forestry."
