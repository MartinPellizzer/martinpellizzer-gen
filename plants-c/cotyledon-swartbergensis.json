    "intro": "Cotyledon swartbergensis, commonly known as the Swartberg cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Cotyledon swartbergensis is a low-growing plant, typically reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters."
