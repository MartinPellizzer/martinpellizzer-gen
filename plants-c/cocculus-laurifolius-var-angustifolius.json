It features heart-shaped leaves with a glossy green surface and a distinctive, spiny fruit that turns from green to black as it matures. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental value. Its stems are woody and often have a slightly hairy texture. This species is often cultivated for its unique appearance and can be used in tropical gardens or as a decorative plant in warmer climates."
