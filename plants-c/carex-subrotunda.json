    "intro": "Carex subrotunda, commonly known as the broad-leaf sedges, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, upright leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomes help it spread and form dense colonies, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. Carex subrotunda is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in wetland conditions."
