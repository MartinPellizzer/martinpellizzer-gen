    "intro": "Cypripedium elegans, commonly known as the elegant lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or white with a yellow throat. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single flower per stem. Cypripedium elegans is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also of interest in botanical research due to its unique pollination mechanisms."
