    "intro": "Crepidophyllum werneri, commonly known as the Werneri's crepidophyllum, is a climbing fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that often have a soft, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to anchor itself in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens for its unique foliage."
