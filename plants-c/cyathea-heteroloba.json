    "intro": "Cyathea heteroloba, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant can grow up to 10 meters in height and has a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived species. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in nighttime pollination. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
