    "intro": "Cousinia lucida, commonly known as the brightflower cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces showy, yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant has narrow, silver-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Cousinia lucida is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
