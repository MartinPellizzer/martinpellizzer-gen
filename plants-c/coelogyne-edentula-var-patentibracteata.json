    "intro": "Coelogyne edentula var. patentibracteata, commonly known as the broad-bract coelogyne, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant produces thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are typically dark green and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique floral display and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
