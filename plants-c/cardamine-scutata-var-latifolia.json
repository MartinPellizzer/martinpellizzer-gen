    "intro": "Cardamine scutata var. latifolia, commonly known as broad-leaved watercress, is a perennial herb native to moist, temperate regions. It features trifoliate leaves with broad, lance-shaped lobes and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in shaded, wet environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic properties. The species is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support insect populations."
