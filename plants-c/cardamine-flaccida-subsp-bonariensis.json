It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant features trifoliate leaves with slender, thread-like stems that often trail along the ground. Its small white flowers are borne in clusters and are pollinated by insects. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
