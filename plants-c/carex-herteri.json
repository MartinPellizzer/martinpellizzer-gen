    "intro": "Carex herteri, commonly known as the Herter's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are followed by three-sided, three-rowed berries. Carex herteri is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
