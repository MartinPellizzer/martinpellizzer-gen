    "intro": "Centropogon yarumalensis, commonly known as the Yarumal orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy inflorescences. The plant typically features narrow, strap-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species from further decline."
