    "intro": "Cambajuva, commonly known as the Brazilian nightshade, is a shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. Its fruit, which resembles a cherry, is typically orange-red when ripe and contains several seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated for food but is studied for its potential medicinal uses."
