    "intro": "Covillea, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These plants are typically perennial and are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. They produce showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Covillea species often have thick, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in their survival in dry conditions. The plant's structure and blooming habits make it a notable species in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
