    "intro": "Catopsis occulta, commonly known as the hidden catopsis, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its foliage is characterized by tightly packed, dark green leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps to collect and retain moisture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, adapted for pollination by insects. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Catopsis occulta is considered a cryptic species with limited scientific study."
