    "intro": "Crassula perforata, commonly known as the stone plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, bluish-green leaves with small holes, known as perforations, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its compact growth habit and unique appearance make it a striking addition to both indoor and outdoor landscapes."
