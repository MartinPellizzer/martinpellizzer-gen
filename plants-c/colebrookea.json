    "intro": "Colebrookea, commonly known as the \"blue poppy,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its striking, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in rocky or alpine environments. Colebrookea species are perennial herbs with lance-shaped leaves and showy, cup-shaped flowers. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they require specific growing conditions to thrive."
