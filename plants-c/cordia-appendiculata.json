    "intro": "Cordia appendiculata, commonly known as the appendiculate cottonwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often glandular leaves that are typically elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous small seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions with a Mediterranean climate. Cordia appendiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy nature and adaptability."
