    "intro": "Chionanthus, commonly known as the fringe tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the Oleaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that resemble fringe-like petals. The leaves are typically opposite, simple, and ovate to elliptic in shape. Native to eastern North America, Chionanthus species are often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
