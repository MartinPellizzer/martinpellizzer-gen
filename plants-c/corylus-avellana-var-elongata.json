    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. elongata, commonly known as the spindle hazel, is a variant of the common hazel that exhibits distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its elongated, spindle-shaped form, which sets it apart from the more compact growth of typical hazel species. The plant produces catkins and edible nuts, with the leaves being alternate and ovate in shape. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. Its unique morphology makes it a valuable species for both ornamental and ecological purposes."
