    "intro": "Convolvulus hystrix subsp. ruspolii, commonly known as the hairy bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain areas."
