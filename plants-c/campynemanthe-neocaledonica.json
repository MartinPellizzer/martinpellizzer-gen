    "intro": "Campynemanthe neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia spider plant, is a striking evergreen herbaceous plant native to the island of New Caledonia. It features striking, dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a distinctive red or purple margin. The plant produces delicate, spider-like inflorescences with small, white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Campynemanthe neocaledonica is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardens."
