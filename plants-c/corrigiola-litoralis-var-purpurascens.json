    "intro": "Corrigiola litoralis var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple sandwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically bluish-green or purple in color. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its ability to tolerate saline and windy conditions makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems."
