    "intro": "Cytisogenista maura, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its woody stem is often branched and covered in a rough, bark-like texture. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sunlight. The seeds are enclosed in elongated pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread."
