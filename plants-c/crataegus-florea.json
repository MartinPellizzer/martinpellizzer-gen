    "intro": "Crataegus florea, commonly known as the flowering hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its showy white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus florea typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
