    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 extraneum, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cirsium vulgare and Cirsium palustre, characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its foliage is covered in stiff, bristly hairs, and it produces a tall, branching stem with numerous flowering heads. Cirsium \u00d7 extraneum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
