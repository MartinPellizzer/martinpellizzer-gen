    "intro": "Cordia haitiensis, commonly known as Haitian cordia, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Haiti. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and opposite, elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forest habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
