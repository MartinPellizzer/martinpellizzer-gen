    "intro": "Cybianthus resinosus, commonly known as the resinous broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rocky or coastal environments. Cybianthus resinosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
