    "intro": "Cerastium decalvans f. albanicum, commonly known as the Albanian mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate habit and small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
