    "intro": "Carex spissa var. seatoniana, commonly known as the Seaton's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates. The leaves are usually narrow, glossy, and have a slight sheen, contributing to its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
