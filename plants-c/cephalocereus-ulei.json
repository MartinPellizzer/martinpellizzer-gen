    "intro": "Cephalocereus ulei, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and is well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant is often cultivated for its striking appearance and unique blooming habit."
