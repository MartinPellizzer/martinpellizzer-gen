    "intro": "Canarium oleiferum, commonly known as the candlenut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces drupes, or fruits, which contain a hard-shelled seed surrounded by an oily pulp. The oil extracted from the seeds is used in traditional medicine and as a source of biodiesel. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various wildlife species and contributing to soil stabilization in coastal areas."
