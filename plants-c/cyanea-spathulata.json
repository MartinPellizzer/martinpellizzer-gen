    "intro": "Cyanea spathulata, commonly known as the Hawaiian sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Cyanea spathulata is often found in sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight along shorelines. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it an important species in Hawaiian flora."
