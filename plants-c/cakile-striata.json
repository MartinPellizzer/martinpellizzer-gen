    "intro": "Cakile striata, commonly known as the striped sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats or cushions, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers in the spring. Its succulent stems and leaves help it store water, making it well-suited for sandy or rocky soils. Cakile striata plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
