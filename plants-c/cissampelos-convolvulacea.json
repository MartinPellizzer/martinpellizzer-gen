It features heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in clusters along the stems. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds. Cissampelos convolvulacea is often found in moist, shaded areas and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
