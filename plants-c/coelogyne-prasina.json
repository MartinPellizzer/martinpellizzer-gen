    "intro": "Coelogyne prasina, commonly known as the green lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and features lance-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant green. The plant produces striking clusters of fragrant, white to pale green flowers with three petals and three sepals. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Coelogyne prasina is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
