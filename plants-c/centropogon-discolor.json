    "intro": "Centropogon discolor, commonly known as the purple false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly rough texture. Its most distinguishing feature is the purple to pinkish disc floret surrounded by ray florets, which give it a dandelion-like appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
