    "intro": "Centaurium filiforme, commonly known as slender centaury, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters and features slender, erect stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and narrow, often appearing in pairs along the stem. Centaurium filiforme is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
