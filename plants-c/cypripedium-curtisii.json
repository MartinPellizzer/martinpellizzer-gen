    "intro": "Cypripedium curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that feature a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a unique adaptation for attracting pollinators. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Cypripedium curtisii is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
