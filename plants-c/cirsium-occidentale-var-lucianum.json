It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and open woodlands. It has a robust root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Its foliage and flowers are often covered in fine hairs, which provide some protection against herbivores."
