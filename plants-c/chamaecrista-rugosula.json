It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open woods. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in soil enrichment."
