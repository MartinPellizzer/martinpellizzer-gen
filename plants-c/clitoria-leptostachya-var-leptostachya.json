It features heart-shaped leaves and distinctive butterfly-like purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces pods containing edible seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisines. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it useful for erosion control and as a cover crop in agricultural settings."
