    "intro": "Columnea meridensis, commonly known as the mountain flame or red columnea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial herb, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a fine pubescence, while its stems are wiry and often trailing. Columnea meridensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
