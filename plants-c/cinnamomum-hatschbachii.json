    "intro": "Cinnamomum hatschbachii, commonly known as the Yunnan cinnamon or the Chinese cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to southwestern China. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark brown bark that resembles true cinnamon. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and oval-shaped leaves with a slightly glossy surface. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its aromatic properties. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is considered a valuable and somewhat endangered species in its native habitat."
