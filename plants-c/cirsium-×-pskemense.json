It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with a robust root system that allows it to thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
