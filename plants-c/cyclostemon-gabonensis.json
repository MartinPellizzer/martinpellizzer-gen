    "intro": "Cyclostemon gabonensis, commonly known as the Gabon cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Central and West Africa. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern and can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. Cyclostemon gabonensis is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils."
