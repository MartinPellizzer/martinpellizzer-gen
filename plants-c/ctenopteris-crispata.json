    "intro": "Ctenopteris crispata, commonly known as the fringed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often curled or fringed, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediments and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Ctenopteris crispata is valued in aquariums for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
