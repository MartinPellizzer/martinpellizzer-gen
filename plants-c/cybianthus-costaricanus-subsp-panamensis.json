It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
