    "intro": "Chondrosum foeneum, commonly known as the silverleaf chondrosum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
