    "intro": "Cyrtostylis huegelii, commonly known as the dwarf star orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has fleshy, grass-like leaves and produces showy, pale yellow to greenish-white blooms. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing in dense undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
