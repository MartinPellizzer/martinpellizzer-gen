    "intro": "Cibotium hasskarlianum, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a tall, woody fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It possesses a massive, trunk-like stem covered with a thick, fibrous layer of old fronds. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. This species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
