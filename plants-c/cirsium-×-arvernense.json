    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 arvernense, commonly known as the common thistle, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple or pink flower heads, which consist of numerous small florets. Native to Europe, it has been introduced to other parts of the world and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces a milky sap that can cause skin irritation, and its flowers are visited by various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
