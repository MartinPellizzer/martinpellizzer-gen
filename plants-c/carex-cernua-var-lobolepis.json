    "intro": "Carex cernua var. lobolepis, commonly known as the nodding sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant features grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled at the base, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a valuable plant for stabilizing soil in wetland areas. The varietal name *lobolepis* refers to the lobed or wavy appearance of its leaf bases."
