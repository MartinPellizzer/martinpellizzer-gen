    "intro": "Cuscuta minor var. pallens, commonly known as the pale dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. The plant is often found growing on a variety of herbaceous plants, including grasses and legumes. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and natural vegetation."
