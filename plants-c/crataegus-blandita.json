    "intro": "Crataegus blandita, commonly known as the smooth hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet and features thornless branches, which distinguish it from other hawthorn species. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in spring, followed by red berries in the fall. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in autumn. Crataegus blandita is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
