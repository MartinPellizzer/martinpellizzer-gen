    "intro": "Ceraia polytricha, commonly known as the common liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is a thalloid liverwort, meaning it has a flat, leaf-like body called a thallus rather than true roots, stems, or leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives on damp soil or rocks. Its structure consists of a central axis with lobes and rhizoids that anchor it to the substrate. Ceraia polytricha plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
