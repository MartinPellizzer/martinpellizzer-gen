    "intro": "Cyclosorus lakhimpurensis, commonly known as the Lakhimpur water fern, is a rare aquatic fern species native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and wetlands. Its reproductive structures, including tiny submerged flowers, are adapted for water pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
