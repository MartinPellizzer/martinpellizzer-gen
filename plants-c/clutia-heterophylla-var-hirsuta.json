It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves and stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The hairy texture of its foliage is a distinguishing botanical feature."
