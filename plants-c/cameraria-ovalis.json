    "intro": "Cameraria ovalis, commonly known as the oval leaf miner, is a small moth species whose larvae are leaf-mining insects. The plant it infests is typically a species of oak, where the larvae feed on the leaves, creating distinctive patterns of damage. The mining behavior of Cameraria ovalis results in visible trails or tunnels within the leaf tissue. This plant-insect interaction is an example of a specific ecological relationship in forest ecosystems. The presence of Cameraria ovalis can indicate the health and biodiversity of the host plant's environment."
