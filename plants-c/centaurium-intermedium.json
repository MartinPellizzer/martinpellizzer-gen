    "intro": "Centaurium intermedium, commonly known as the common centaury, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, erect stems that are often branched and covered with fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Centaurium intermedium is typically found in moist meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
