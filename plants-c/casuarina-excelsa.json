    "intro": "Casuarina excelsa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf she-oak, is a tall, evergreen tree native to Australia. It has distinctive, needle-like leaves that are arranged in compact clusters, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, spherical flowers that are typically green or brown, and it is wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in woody cones and are dispersed by wind. Casuarina excelsa is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils."
