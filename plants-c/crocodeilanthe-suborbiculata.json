It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features dark green, orbicular-shaped fronds with a leathery texture and a distinct, glossy appearance. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients in its natural habitat. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, well-drained environment."
