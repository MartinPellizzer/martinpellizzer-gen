    "intro": "Copiapoa humilis subsp. longispina, commonly known as the long-spined copiapoa, is a low-growing cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its spines are long and straight, providing protection from herbivores and aiding in shade. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
