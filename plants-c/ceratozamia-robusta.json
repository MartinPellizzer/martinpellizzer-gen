    "intro": "Ceratozamia robusta, commonly known as the robust cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically appearing on separate plants. Ceratozamia robusta is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it a valuable species in botanical conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several regions."
