    "intro": "Cremastus glutinosus, commonly known as the sticky balm, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with hairy, aromatic leaves that emit a strong, spicy scent. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its sticky secretions, which give it its common name, are used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and dry landscapes."
