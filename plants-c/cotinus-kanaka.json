    "intro": "Cotinus kanaka, commonly known as the Hawaiian smoke tree, is a deciduous shrub native to the island of Oahu in Hawaii. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery inflorescences that resemble plumes, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, which are often mistaken for smoke or mist. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and turn reddish in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. Cotinus kanaka thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry forest habitats."
