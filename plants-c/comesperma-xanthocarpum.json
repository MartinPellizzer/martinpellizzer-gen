It is a small shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils, often in coastal or inland regions. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are distinctive in appearance and are a key feature of its botanical identity. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a leathery texture that helps it conserve water in arid conditions.
