    "intro": "Crataegus melanocarpa var. kotschyana, commonly known as the Kotschy's hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate leaves with serrated margins, and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces red to purple berries that are edible for birds and mammals but are generally not consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
