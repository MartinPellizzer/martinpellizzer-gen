    "intro": "Corallorhiza anandae, commonly known as the Anand\u2019s coralroot, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in shaded, moist woodlands. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss and its secretive nature, it is considered endangered in many areas."
