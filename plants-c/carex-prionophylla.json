    "intro": "Carex prionophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in a cylindrical inflorescence. Carex prionophylla is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
