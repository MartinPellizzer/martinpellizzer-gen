    "intro": "Capparis nummularia var. typica, commonly known as the rock caper, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that contain several seeds. This species is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant in coastal and Mediterranean climates."
