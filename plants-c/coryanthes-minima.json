    "intro": "Coryanthes minima, commonly known as the miniature coryanthe, is a small orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that are typically less than an inch in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its flowers are often pale green or yellowish, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Despite its small size, Coryanthes minima plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
