    "intro": "Christiana macrodon, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving waters. The plant's showy white flowers, which bloom at night, are a key feature, attracting pollinators such as bats and moths. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize the sediment in its aquatic habitat. The leaves are thick and waxy, providing buoyancy and protection against herbivores."
