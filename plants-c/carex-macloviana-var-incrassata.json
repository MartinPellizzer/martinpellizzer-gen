    "intro": "Carex macloviana var. incrassata, commonly known as the broad-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers in the summer months. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
