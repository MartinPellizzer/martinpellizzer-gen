It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh, cold climates. The plant features basal rosettes of leaves and produces showy, yellow to orange inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture in nutrient-poor soils. Cousinia ovczinnikovii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
