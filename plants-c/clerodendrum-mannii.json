It is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers that appear in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are lance-shaped to elliptical. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Clerodendrum mannii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in full sun with well-drained soil."
