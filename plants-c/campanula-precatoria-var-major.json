It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, supporting large, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of down, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
