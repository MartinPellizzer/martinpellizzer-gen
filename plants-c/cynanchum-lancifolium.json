    "intro": "Cynanchum lancifolium, commonly known as the lancifoliate milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late summer. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, containing compounds that deter herbivores. Cynanchum lancifolium thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
