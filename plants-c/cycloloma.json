    "intro": "Cycloloma, commonly known as the needlepod or needlepod vetch, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. Cycloloma species are often found in rocky soils and can be used for erosion control due to their hardy nature. The seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods, which contribute to its common name."
