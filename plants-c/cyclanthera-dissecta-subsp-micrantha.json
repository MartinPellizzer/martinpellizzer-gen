    "intro": "Cyclanthera dissecta subsp. micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bitter gourd, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It produces elongated, pale green fruits with a distinctive bumpy surface and a bitter taste. The plant features palmately lobed leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruits, though they require careful preparation due to their bitterness. The subspecies is characterized by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Cyclanthera dissecta."
