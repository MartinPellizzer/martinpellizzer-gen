    "intro": "Cinnamomum chiapense, commonly known as Chiapanensis cinnamon, is a species of flowering plant in the laurel family, Lauraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico, particularly in the states of Chiapas and Oaxaca. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. Its bark and leaves contain essential oils, which contribute to its use in traditional medicine and as a spice. However, due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
