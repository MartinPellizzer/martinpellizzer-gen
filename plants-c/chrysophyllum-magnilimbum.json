It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and fragrant, white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically edible and have a sweet, creamy pulp. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks.
