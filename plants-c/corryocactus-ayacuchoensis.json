    "intro": "Corryocactus ayacuchoensis, commonly known as the Ayacucho cactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to the Andean region of Peru. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and dense covering of spines, which help it survive in its arid and high-altitude environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise spiny structure. It is adapted to extreme conditions, including high UV exposure and limited water availability. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
