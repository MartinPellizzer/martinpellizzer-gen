    "intro": "Chrozophora warionii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of North America. It features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, globe-shaped seed heads that resemble dandelion fluff. Its fibrous root system allows it to survive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. Chrozophora warionii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
