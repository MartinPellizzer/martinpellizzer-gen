    "intro": "Cupressus \u00d7 wangii, commonly known as the Chinese lacebark cypress, is a hybrid coniferous tree native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive exfoliating bark that peels in thin, papery layers, revealing a mottled pattern of green and brown. The plant has scale-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a dense, compact appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous cones and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. This species is well-suited to a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
