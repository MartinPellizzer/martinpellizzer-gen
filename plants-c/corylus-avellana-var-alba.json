    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. alba, commonly known as the white hazel, is a variant of the common hazel that is distinguished by its white flowers. This plant is native to parts of Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in woodland and hedgerow environments. The white hazel produces small, edible nuts similar to those of the common hazel, though they are often less abundant. Its flowers appear in early spring, adding ornamental value to the landscape. The plant is valued for its ecological role, providing food for wildlife and supporting pollinators."
