    "intro": "Cryptotaenia japonica, commonly known as Japanese cow parsley, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features slender, hollow stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a silvery-grey pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Cryptotaenia japonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
