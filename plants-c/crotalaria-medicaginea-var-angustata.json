    "intro": "Crotalaria medicaginea var. angustata, commonly known as narrow-leaf velvetleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in disturbed soils and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and allelopathic properties, it can become a significant weed in various ecosystems."
