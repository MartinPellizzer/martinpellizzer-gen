It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that resemble flames. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and thrives in humid, tropical climates. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a velvety texture, while its flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds. Centropogon costaricanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
