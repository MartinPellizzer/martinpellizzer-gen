    "intro": "Capparis oblongata, commonly known as the round-capsica, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy, orange-red fruits that are edible but often used as ornamental features in gardens. Capparis oblongata thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is often found in rocky or coastal areas due to its drought-resistant nature."
