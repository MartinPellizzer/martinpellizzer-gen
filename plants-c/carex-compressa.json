    "intro": "Carex compressa, commonly known as narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and dense, spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Carex compressa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
