    "intro": "Carica papaya f. portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican papaya, is a botanical variant of the common papaya. It is characterized by its distinct leaf morphology and fruiting habits compared to the standard species. The plant typically exhibits a compact growth habit with broader leaves and a shorter stem. Its fruit is generally smaller and has a more fibrous texture than that of the typical papaya. This variety is native to Puerto Rico and is adapted to the island's tropical climate."
