    "intro": "Cleyera nimanimae var. viridula, commonly known as the greenleaf cleyera, is a rare shrub native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Actinidiaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for certain wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
