    "intro": "Cinnamomum caudatum, commonly known as the hairy cinnamon or wild cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark brown bark that resembles true cinnamon, though it is not related to the Cinnamomum verum species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and dark purple berries, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a pleasant, spicy aroma. Cinnamomum caudatum thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks."
