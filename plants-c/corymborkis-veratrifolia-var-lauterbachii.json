    "intro": "Corymborkis veratrifolia var. lauterbachii, commonly known as the Lauterbach's coralroot, is a rare and delicate orchid native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients rather than photosynthesis. The plant lacks chlorophyll and has a pale, almost translucent appearance with small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in shaded, moist environments within tropical forests, often growing in association with specific tree species. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
