It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows up to 10 meters tall, with lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries containing the seeds used for coffee. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. This variety is valued for its aromatic and flavorful coffee beans, which are often used in specialty coffee blends."
