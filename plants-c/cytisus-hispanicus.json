    "intro": "Cytisus hispanicus, commonly known as Spanish broom, is a flowering shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant touch to its foliage. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential invasiveness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful management."
