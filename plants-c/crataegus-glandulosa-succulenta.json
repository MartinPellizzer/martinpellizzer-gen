    "intro": "Crataegus glandulosa succulenta, commonly known as the succulent hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, a feature typical of succulent plants. The leaves are usually grayish-green with a waxy coating, and the plant produces small, white or pink flowers in spring. It bears red or orange berries in the fall, which are edible but often tart. The plant is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert regions."
