    "intro": "Carpinus carpinus, commonly known as hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and riparian habitats. Carpinus carpinus is valued for its hard, heavy wood and its ecological role in supporting diverse wildlife."
