It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with red or purple, and it produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for arid environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular ornamental plant in xeriscaping."
