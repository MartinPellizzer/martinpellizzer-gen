    "intro": "Corymbia candida subsp. lautifolia, commonly known as the white ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, whitish bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a waxy coating. It produces small, fragrant white flowers clustered in rounded inflorescences, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant."
