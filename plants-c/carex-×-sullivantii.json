    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 sullivantii, commonly known as the Sullivant's sedge, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, strap-shaped leaves and dense, spike-like flower clusters. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
