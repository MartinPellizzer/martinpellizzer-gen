    "intro": "Clerodendrum sessilifolium, commonly known as the hanging clerodendrum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its drooping, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. It thrives in humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, round berries that contain the seeds."
