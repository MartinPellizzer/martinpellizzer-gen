    "intro": "Clematis sepium, commonly known as the red clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to Europe and western Asia. It features compound leaves with three to seven elliptical leaflets, and its flowers are typically fragrant, with five to seven petals. The plant produces small, round, blue-black berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental climbing plants. Clematis sepium is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
