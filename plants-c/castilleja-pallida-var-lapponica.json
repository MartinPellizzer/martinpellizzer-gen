It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and has a short, erect stem with opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It relies on host plants for water and nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship with grasses and other herbaceous species. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
