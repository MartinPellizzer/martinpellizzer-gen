    "intro": "Claytonia exigua, commonly known as the dwarf spring beauty, is a small herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. The plant features rosettes of glossy, oval-shaped leaves and produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully unfurl. Claytonia exigua is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit and delicate appearance."
