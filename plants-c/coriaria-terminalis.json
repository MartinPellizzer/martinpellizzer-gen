    "intro": "Coriaria terminalis, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red cedar, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, round, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal chaparral habitats. Due to its limited range and susceptibility to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
