    "intro": "Chrysosplenium shiobarense, commonly known as the Shiobara chrysosplenium, is a flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant features rosettes of basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are usually short and creeping. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and is often found in rocky or humus-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native habitat."
