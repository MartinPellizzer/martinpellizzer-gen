    "intro": "Calamagrostis breviseta, commonly known as the narrow-bristled reed, is a perennial grass native to parts of Asia and North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, upright stalks with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in short, bristly hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Calamagrostis breviseta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
