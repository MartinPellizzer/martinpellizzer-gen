    "intro": "Cuscuta stylosa, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves attaching to host plants via haustoria, specialized structures that penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant is often found growing on a variety of herbaceous hosts, including grasses and legumes. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through the movement of the host plant. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth and health of its host."
