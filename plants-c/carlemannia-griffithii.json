    "intro": "Carlemannia griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's carlemannia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern India. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in areas with high altitudes and cool climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silky texture, while its flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Carlemannia griffithii is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
