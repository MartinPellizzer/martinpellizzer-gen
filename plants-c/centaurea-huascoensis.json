    "intro": "Centaurea huascoensis, commonly known as the Huasco thistle, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Chile. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in coastal dunes and rocky soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Centaurea huascoensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various insects and small animals."
