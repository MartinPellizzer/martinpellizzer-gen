    "intro": "Chaerophyllum rapaceum var. prescottii, commonly known as Prescott's hogweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in compound umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Due to its resemblance to other toxic species, it can be mistaken for poisonous plants, requiring careful identification."
