    "intro": "Corynephorus fascicularis, commonly known as the clustered grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening and erosion control."
