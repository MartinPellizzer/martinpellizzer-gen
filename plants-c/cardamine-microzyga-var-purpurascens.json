    "intro": "Cardamine microzyga var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-stemmed watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features slender, upright stems that are often tinged with a striking purple hue, particularly along the veins. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on elongated pedicels. Its leaves are alternate, deeply lobed, and often have a peppery flavor when crushed. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens for its unique appearance and ecological benefits."
