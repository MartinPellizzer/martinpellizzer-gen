    "intro": "Choretrum spicatum, commonly known as the spikeless bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its simple, branched stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant is carnivorous, using specialized structures called bladders to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in muddy or sandy substrates. Its presence is an indicator of relatively undisturbed aquatic ecosystems."
