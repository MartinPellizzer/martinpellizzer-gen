    "intro": "Cerastium canescens, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas. Cerastium canescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
