    "intro": "Chiliandra, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. Chiliandra is valued for its durable wood, which is used in traditional craftsmanship and furniture making. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
