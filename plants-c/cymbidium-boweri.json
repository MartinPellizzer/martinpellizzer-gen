    "intro": "Cymbidium boweri, commonly known as the Bower's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces pendulous, fragrant blooms in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often with a distinctive red or purple lip. Cymbidium boweri is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in a branching pattern with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It prefers cool, humid conditions and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses."
