The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous nature. Its growth habit is usually low and spreading, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Due to its unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and ecological niches."
