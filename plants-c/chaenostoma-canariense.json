    "intro": "Chaenostoma canariense, commonly known as the Canary Island waterwheel, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources in its native habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
