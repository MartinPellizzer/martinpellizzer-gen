    "intro": "Ctenopteris melanosticta, commonly known as the black-stained sea fern, is a marine plant belonging to the family Zosteraceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically 15\u201330 cm in length. The plant thrives in shallow, tide-pool environments and is often found in the intertidal zones of tropical and subtropical regions. Its structure consists of a short, creeping rhizome with dense, branching fronds that are adapted to withstand wave action. Ctenopteris melanosticta plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for small marine organisms."
