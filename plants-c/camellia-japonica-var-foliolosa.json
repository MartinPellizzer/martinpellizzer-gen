    "intro": "Camellia japonica var. foliolosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf camellia, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Camellia japonica. The plant produces showy, camellia-like flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. This variety is also valued for its ability to provide winter interest and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
