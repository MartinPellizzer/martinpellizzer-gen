    "intro": "Craibia simplex, commonly known as the golden star vine, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has thin, trailing stems that often grow along the ground or climb supports, making it suitable for hanging baskets or trellises. Its leaves are simple and opposite, with a smooth, glossy surface. Craibia simplex thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
