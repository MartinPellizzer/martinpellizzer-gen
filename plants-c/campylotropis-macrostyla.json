    "intro": "Campylotropis macrostyla, commonly known as the large-flowered cowpea vine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, cylindrical legumes that mature into brown pods, which contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
