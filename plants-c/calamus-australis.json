    "intro": "Calamus australis, commonly known as the Australian arrowroot, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to Australia and New Guinea. It is a tall, slender grass-like plant that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional basketry. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically followed by clusters of edible, starchy tubers. These tubers are a staple food source for many Indigenous communities and are valued for their nutritional content and versatility in cooking. Calamus australis thrives in wetland and swampy environments, showcasing its adaptation to waterlogged soils."
