It is characterized by its long, drooping panicles of bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces oval, woody pods that contain flat, winged seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slight serration along the edges. Cassia carnaval is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its vibrant floral display."
