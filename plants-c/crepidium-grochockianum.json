    "intro": "Crepidium grochockianum, commonly known as the Grochock's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its often humid and shaded habitat. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to reduce water loss in its natural environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
