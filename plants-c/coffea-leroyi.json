    "intro": "Coffea leroyi, commonly known as the L\u00e9roy's coffee, is a rare and little-known species of the Rubiaceae family. Native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it is characterized by its small, red berries and evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. It produces seeds within its berries, which are enclosed in a fleshy, red pericarp. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coffea leroyi is considered a species of conservation concern."
