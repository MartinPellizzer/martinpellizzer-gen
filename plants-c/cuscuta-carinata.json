    "intro": "Cuscuta carinata, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with tendrils that attach to host plants. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means, allowing it to colonize a wide range of host species. It is often found on crops such as wheat, barley, and legumes, making it an agricultural pest. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, with the plant dying off when the host is removed."
