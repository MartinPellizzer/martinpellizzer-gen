    "intro": "Cerastium stellaria, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. Cerastium stellaria is often found in grassy areas, along paths, and in disturbed soils, and it is sometimes used in herbal medicine."
