    "intro": "Cyrtandra agrihanensis, commonly known as the Agrihan sandpiper plant, is a flowering plant native to the Northern Mariana Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant grows in coastal sand dunes and rocky habitats, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range. It has hairy leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
