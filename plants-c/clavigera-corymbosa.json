    "intro": "Clavigera corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of blue and violet. The plant typically reaches heights of 1 to 3 meters and features hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits containing several seeds. Clavigera corymbosa is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
