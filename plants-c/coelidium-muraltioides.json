    "intro": "Coelidium muraltioides, commonly known as the Muralt's coelidium, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Arecaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces striking, clustered inflorescences. The plant's leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Coelidium muraltioides is considered a rare and endangered species."
