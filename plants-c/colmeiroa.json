    "intro": "Colmeiroa, commonly known as the rock rose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and includes species such as *Colmeiroa galioides* and *Colmeiroa oppositifolia*. These plants are characterized by their upright growth habit, hairy stems, and clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The leaves are typically opposite and linear, often with a bluish or grayish hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Colmeiroa species are often used in rock gardens and dry landscapes due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
