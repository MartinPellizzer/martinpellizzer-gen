    "intro": "Cenchrus basedowii, commonly known as the desert grass or basedow's grass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes. Cenchrus basedowii is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ecological resilience."
