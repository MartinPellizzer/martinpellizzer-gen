    "intro": "Callianthe purpusii, commonly known as the Purpus's sea holly, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in full sun. Its striking blue to violet flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Callianthe purpusii is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
