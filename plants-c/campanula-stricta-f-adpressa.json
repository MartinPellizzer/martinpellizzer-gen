    "intro": "Campanula stricta f. adpressa, commonly known as the compact bellflower, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves that are tightly pressed against the stem, giving it a mat-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, decorative plant."
