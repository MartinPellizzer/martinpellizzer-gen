    "intro": "Cereus pentlandii var. dolichacanthus, commonly known as the long-spined night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its spines are long and stiff, providing protection from herbivores. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for arid gardens."
