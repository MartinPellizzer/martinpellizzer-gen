    "intro": "Carex parryana, commonly known as Parry's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, stream banks, and other wet habitats. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. Carex parryana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
