    "intro": "Cerastium carnosulum, commonly known as the fat hen or mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, rounded fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its hairy leaves and compact growth make it easily distinguishable from other chickweed species."
