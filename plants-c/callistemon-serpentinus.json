    "intro": "Callistemon serpentinus, commonly known as the serpentine bottlebrush, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its striking red or orange bottlebrush-like inflorescences, which are composed of numerous dense, tubular flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils, often found on serpentine rock outcrops. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often have a bluish-green hue. The species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant plant."
