    "intro": "Cremanium sieberi, commonly known as the Sieber's cremanium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a smooth texture, while its stems are slender and somewhat woody. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
