    "intro": "Cuscuta epithymum var. bullata, commonly known as the scarlet dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish or reddish flowers and has a distinctive, thread-like appearance due to its slender, branching stems. The plant is native to various regions in Europe and Asia and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the species is noted for its rapid growth and ability to infest a wide range of host species. The plant's unique biology makes it an interesting subject in the study of parasitic flora."
