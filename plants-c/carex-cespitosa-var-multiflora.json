    "intro": "Carex cespitosa var. multiflora, commonly known as the tufted sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. The leaves are usually dark green and have a narrow, grass-like appearance, making it a valuable plant for wetland restoration projects."
