    "intro": "Cyclopeltis mirabilis, commonly known as the golden star vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, making it a striking ornamental plant. The leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while the stems are woody and capable of rapid growth. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This plant is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small insects."
