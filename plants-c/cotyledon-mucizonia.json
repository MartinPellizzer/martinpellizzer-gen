    "intro": "Cotyledon mucizonia, commonly known as the jelly bean plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are often ribbed and can change color in response to light exposure. Cotyledon mucizonia is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
