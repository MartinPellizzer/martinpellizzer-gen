It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae, which includes many salt-tolerant species. The plant has small, green, fleshy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with limited water availability. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils."
