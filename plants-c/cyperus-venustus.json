    "intro": "Cyperus venustus, commonly known as the pretty flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Cyperus venustus is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist environments."
