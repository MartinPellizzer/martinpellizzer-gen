It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers, pumpkins, and gourds. The plant produces distinctive, elongated yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its fruits are small, green berries that turn red when mature, and they contain a toxic, bitter pulp. Cyclanthera longiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
