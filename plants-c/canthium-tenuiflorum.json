It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or wetlands. Its flowers are usually clustered in terminal or axillary cymes, and the fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds. The species is noted for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
