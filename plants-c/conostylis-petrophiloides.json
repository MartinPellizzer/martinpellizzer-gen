    "intro": "Conostylis petrophiloides, commonly known as the rock-loving conostylis, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale blue or purple in color. It has fibrous roots and narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss. Conostylis petrophiloides is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
