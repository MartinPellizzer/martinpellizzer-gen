    "intro": "Corydalis flexuosa subsp. microflora, commonly known as the dwarf zigzag larkspur, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The flowers are showy, with bright pink to purple petals that have a distinctive zigzag pattern on the outer edges. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
