    "intro": "Cardamine rotundifolia var. diversifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features alternate, broadly rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender, erect stems. Its root system consists of a short, thickened rhizome with numerous fibrous roots, allowing it to thrive in waterlogged soils. This variety is closely related to other members of the Ruprikingiaceae family and is often found in stream banks and wet meadows."
