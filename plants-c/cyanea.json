    "intro": "Cyanea, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Cyanea species are often shrubs or small trees, with thick, waxy leaves that help them retain moisture in salty, windy environments. They produce capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water. The genus includes several species, such as Cyanea corymbosa, which is native to the Pacific Islands and Hawaii."
