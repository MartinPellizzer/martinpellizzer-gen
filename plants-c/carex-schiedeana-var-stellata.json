    "intro": "Carex schiedeana var. stellata, commonly known as star sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces distinctive, showy inflorescences with bract-like structures that resemble stars, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. Star sedge is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
