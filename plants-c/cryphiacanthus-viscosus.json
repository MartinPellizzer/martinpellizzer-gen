It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant is notable for its sticky secretions on its leaves and stems, which can trap small insects. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Cryphiacanthus viscosus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
