It is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats.
