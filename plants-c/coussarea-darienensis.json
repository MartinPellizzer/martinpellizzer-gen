    "intro": "Coussarea darienensis, commonly known as the Darien coussarea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Darien region of Panama. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
