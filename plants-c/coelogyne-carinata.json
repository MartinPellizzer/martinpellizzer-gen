    "intro": "Coelogyne carinata, commonly known as the ridged vanda, is a striking orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy bloom, and it thrives in warm, humid environments. It is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil. Coelogyne carinata is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and ease of cultivation."
