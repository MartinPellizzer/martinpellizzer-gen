    "intro": "Chrysosplenium singalilense, commonly known as the Singalilene waterleaf, is a species of flowering plant native to the wetlands and marshy areas of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of ovate, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams and in swampy regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
