It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-brown flowers in the summer. It is adapted to moist or water-saturated soils and plays a role in stabilizing shoreline habitats. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
