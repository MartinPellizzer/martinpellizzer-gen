    "intro": "Cleistocactus colubrinus var. flavispinus, commonly known as the yellow-spined columnar cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often followed by red or orange fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for succulent collections and rock gardens."
