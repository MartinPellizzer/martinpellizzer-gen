    "intro": "Conopodium rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaved bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its submerged, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are rounded and often covered in fine, hair-like structures. Conopodium rotundifolium is a carnivorous plant that plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling microorganism populations."
