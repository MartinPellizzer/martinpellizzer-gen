    "intro": "Cydista aequinoctialis, commonly known as the equinox orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that bloom during the equinox periods. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces pale green or white blooms with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific conditions to flourish, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, it is considered an endangered species in its natural range."
