    "intro": "Cleistogenes serotina var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous false brome, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences that often remain closed (cleistogamous) for much of the growing season. One of its notable features is the production of viviparous seeds, which germinate while still attached to the parent plant. This adaptation allows it to propagate effectively in harsh, disturbed environments."
