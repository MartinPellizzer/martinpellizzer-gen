    "intro": "Calyptrolepis, commonly known as the hooded fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its unique, hood-like bracts that enclose the inflorescence, giving it its common name. Calyptrolepis species typically have compound leaves with a feathery appearance, and they often grow in shaded, humid environments. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
