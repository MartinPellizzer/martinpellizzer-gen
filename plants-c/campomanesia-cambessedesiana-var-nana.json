    "intro": "Campomanesia cambessedesiana var. nana, commonly known as dwarf guava, is a compact shrub native to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. It features small, ovate leaves with a glossy green surface and serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, sweet fruits similar to guavas. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit yield. Due to its size, it is well-suited for small gardens or container planting."
