    "intro": "Calophanes oblongifolius var. texensis, commonly known as the Texas narrow-leaf calophane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers appear in clusters and bloom in the spring. The species is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
