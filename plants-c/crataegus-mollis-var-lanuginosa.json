    "intro": "Crataegus mollis var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the downy hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, oval leaves that are covered in a fine, fuzzy pubescence. The plant produces white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
