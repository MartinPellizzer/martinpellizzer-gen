    "intro": "Centranthus marinus, commonly known as sea centranthus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a perennial herb that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shores and dunes. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, clustered blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Centranthus marinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
