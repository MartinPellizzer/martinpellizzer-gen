    "intro": "Carica hermaphrodita, commonly known as the Mexican papaya, is a tropical plant native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is a member of the Caricaceae family and is characterized by its large, fleshy, yellow-orange fruits. The plant is typically dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, although some individuals may be hermaphroditic. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers. The fruit is rich in enzymes like papain and is widely used in culinary and medicinal applications."
