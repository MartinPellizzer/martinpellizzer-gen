    "intro": "Calophaca depressa, commonly known as the dwarf calophaca, is a small, herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
