    "intro": "Cometes surattensis, commonly known as the Surat's comet plant, is a rare flowering species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a slightly serrated margin. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
