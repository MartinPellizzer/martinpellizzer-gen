    "intro": "Canthium barbatum var. rupestre, commonly known as the rock canthium, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and serrated leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by three-lobed, capsule-like fruits. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water availability. Its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a notable species in xerophytic landscapes."
