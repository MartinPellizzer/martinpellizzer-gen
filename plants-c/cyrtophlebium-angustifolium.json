    "intro": "Cyrtophlebium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly curled and have a glossy texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
