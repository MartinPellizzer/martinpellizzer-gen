    "intro": "Callicarpa americana, commonly known as the American beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of bright purple berries that appear in the fall, making it a striking ornamental plant. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the showy fruit. The berries are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally not recommended for human consumption due to their tart flavor."
