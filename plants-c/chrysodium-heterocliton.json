    "intro": "Chrysodium heterocliton, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and exquisite member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green coloration, with intricate patterns resembling stars on its petals. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically small but highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators like bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chrysodium heterocliton is considered a conservation concern."
