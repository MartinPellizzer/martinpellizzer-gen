    "intro": "Callitriche palustris var. oryzetorum, commonly known as the rice leaved water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to wetlands and slow-moving waters. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments and has slender, branching stems that often lie close to the water surface. The plant produces tiny, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, and its leaves are narrow, ribbon-like, and often arranged in whorls. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, muddy substrates. This variant is distinguished by its broader, more rice-like leaves compared to the typical form of Callitriche palustris."
