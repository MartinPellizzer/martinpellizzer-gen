    "intro": "Carlina corymbosa var. microcephala, commonly known as the narrow-headed cudweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features a basal rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves and produces small, dandelion-like yellow flowers in late summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow, cylindrical flower head surrounded by pale green bracts. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly environments."
