    "intro": "Celastrus hypoleucus f. argutior, commonly known as the broad-leaved bindweed, is a variant of the common bindweed, characterized by its broader, more elongated leaves. It is a climbing vine native to North America, particularly found in the eastern United States. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright orange berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its stems are woody and can become quite long, allowing it to climb and spread rapidly in suitable habitats. The leaves are typically opposite and have a rough texture, contributing to its distinct botanical appearance."
