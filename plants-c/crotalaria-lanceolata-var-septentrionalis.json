    "intro": "Crotalaria lanceolata var. septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern crotalaria, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southeastern United States. It features erect, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape with a hairy underside. The plant produces yellow, spurred flowers arranged in racemes, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. The seeds are enclosed in inflated pods that split open to release the seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
