    "intro": "Clymenum uncinatum var. vulgare, commonly known as the common goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, and branched inflorescence that resembles a beard, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom from late spring to early summer. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
