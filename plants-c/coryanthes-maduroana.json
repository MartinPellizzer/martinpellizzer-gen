    "intro": "Coryanthes maduroana, commonly known as the Maduroana Pitcher Plant, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Venezuela. It belongs to the family Nepenthaceae and is characterized by its large, colorful, and often intricate pitcher-shaped leaves. The plant's unique structure functions as a trap, luring and digesting insects with a sweet-smelling nectar. Its vibrant colors and specialized morphology make it a notable species in botanical studies. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered vulnerable in its native range."
