    "intro": "Cybianthus apiculatus, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically features dense clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Cybianthus apiculatus thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to survive in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
