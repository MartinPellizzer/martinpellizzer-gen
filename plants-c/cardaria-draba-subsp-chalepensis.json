    "intro": "Cardaria draba subsp. chalepensis, commonly known as the Armenian dwarf cress, is a low-growing annual plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It typically features small, bright yellow flowers and is characterized by its hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found in alpine and subalpine zones. It is an important component of the local flora, contributing to soil stabilization and providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many areas."
