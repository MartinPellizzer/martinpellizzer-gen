It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest edges, wetlands, and along riverbanks. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with serrated edges, and it can reach heights of up to 5 meters. Crataegus fennica is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
