It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves around the stem. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish flowers, which are followed by dark, round berries. Calamus verticillaris is often found in wetlands and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
