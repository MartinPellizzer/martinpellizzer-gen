    "intro": "Chrysanthemum rupestre, commonly known as the rock chrysanthemum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky regions of Europe and western Asia. It features narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow or white flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for landscaping in dry climates."
