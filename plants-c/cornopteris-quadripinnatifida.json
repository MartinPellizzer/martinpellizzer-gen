    "intro": "Cornopteris quadripinnatifida, commonly known as the four-pinnate wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with the fourth level of division being pinnatifid. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds. The fern's elegant structure and ability to tolerate wet conditions make it a notable species in ecological and horticultural contexts."
