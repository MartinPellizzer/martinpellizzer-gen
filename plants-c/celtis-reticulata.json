    "intro": "Celtis reticulata, commonly known as the Chinese hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by spherical, yellowish fruits that ripen in late summer. Celtis reticulata is adaptable to various soil types and is often found in urban environments due to its tolerance of pollution and compacted soils. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide shade."
