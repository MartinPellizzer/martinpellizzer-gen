    "intro": "Chamorchis alpina, commonly known as the alpine chamomile, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant features a compact, bushy growth habit with narrow, gray-green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its aromatic leaves and flowers contain essential oils, which have been used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties. Chamorchis alpina is valued for its resilience and ability to flourish in harsh, nutrient-poor soils."
