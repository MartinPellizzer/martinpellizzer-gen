It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, strap-shaped leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with pale to yellowish flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens and restoration projects."
