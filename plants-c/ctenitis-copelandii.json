    "intro": "Ctenitis copelandii, commonly known as the Copeland's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains the spore-producing organs. Its fronds are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the trunk, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Ctenitis copelandii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas."
