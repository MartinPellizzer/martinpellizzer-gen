    "intro": "Corydalis bulbosa f. major, commonly known as the large-flowered corydalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It features slender, erect stems that bear clusters of delicate, spurred flowers in shades of pink and purple. The leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces small, bulbous tubers underground, which serve as storage organs and aid in its survival during adverse conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and woodland settings."
