    "intro": "Columnea hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy flame flower, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often resembling flames. The plant has hairy foliage, which gives it its common name, and it typically grows as an epiphyte or on rocky substrates. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea hirsutissima is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
