It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its unique, hood-like bracts that enclose its flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist conditions, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its flowers are small and white or pale yellow, arranged in umbels, and it produces small, spherical fruits. Cupularia clausonis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its distinctive appearance."
