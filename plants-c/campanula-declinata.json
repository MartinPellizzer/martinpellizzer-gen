It is characterized by its upright stem and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This species thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
