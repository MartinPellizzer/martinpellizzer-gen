It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that are edible for both humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production. The varietal form brachycalyx is distinguished by its shorter calyx compared to the typical species."
