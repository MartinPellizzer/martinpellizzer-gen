    "intro": "Calylophus, commonly known as the spiny spurge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, often spiny stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The flowers are typically small and clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia, a common feature in the Euphorbiaceae family. Calylophus species are native to various regions in Africa, the Americas, and parts of Asia. They are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and drought tolerance."
