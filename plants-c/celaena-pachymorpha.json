    "intro": "Celaena pachymorpha, commonly known as the giant water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It has thick, waxy leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, allowing it to float on the surface of water bodies. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to dense mats covering water surfaces. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a problematic species in many regions outside its native range."
