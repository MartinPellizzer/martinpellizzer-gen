    "intro": "Cineraria cordifolia var. auriculata, commonly known as the Auriculate Cineraria, is a striking perennial plant native to the Canary Islands. It features rosettes of velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver or gray, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright blue or violet flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its frost-sensitive nature, requiring protection in colder climates."
