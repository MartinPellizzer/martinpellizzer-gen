    "intro": "Cereus aurantiacus, commonly known as the red torch cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach up to 10 feet in height. The plant produces striking red flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its stems are covered in spines, which provide protection from herbivores. Cereus aurantiacus is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight."
