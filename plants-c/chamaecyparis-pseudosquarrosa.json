    "intro": "Chamaecyparis pseudosquarrosa, commonly known as the Japanese cedar or Japanese white cedar, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and scale-like leaves that are typically white or pale blue underneath. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Due to its slow growth and longevity, it is often used in landscape design for its aesthetic and structural qualities."
