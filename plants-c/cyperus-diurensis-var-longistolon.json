    "intro": "Cyperus diurensis var. longistolon, commonly known as the long-stemmed flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets. The plant thrives in moist or aquatic conditions, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of wetland vegetation. The species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
