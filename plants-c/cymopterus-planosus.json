    "intro": "Cymopterus planosus, commonly known as the plains evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
