    "intro": "Convolvulus secundus var. parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically pale purple or white, with five petals and a distinct tubular corolla. This species is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in waste areas. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
