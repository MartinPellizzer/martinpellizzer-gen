It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its finely divided, pinnatifid leaves that give it a lacy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. This subspecies is notable for its potential medicinal uses and its role as a weed in various ecosystems."
