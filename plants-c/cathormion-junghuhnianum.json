    "intro": "Cathormion junghuhnianum, commonly known as the Kew's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, often with a pale or translucent appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cathormion junghuhnianum is considered critically endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
