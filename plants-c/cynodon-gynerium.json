    "intro": "Cynodon gynerium, commonly known as Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant has rhizomes and stolons that allow it to spread rapidly and form a thick turf. It thrives in warm climates and is highly drought-tolerant, making it a popular choice for lawns and pastures. Its ability to recover quickly from damage makes it a resilient and versatile grass species."
