    "intro": "Crepis glomerata var. porphyrea, commonly known as the purple-headed mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, pale green leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its scientific name reflects its close relation to other species in the Crepis genus, which are typically found in rocky or disturbed habitats. The variety porphyrea is distinguished by its purple-tinged flower heads, adding to its ornamental appeal."
