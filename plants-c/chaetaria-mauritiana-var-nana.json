    "intro": "Chaetaria mauritiana var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf chaetaria, is a compact, low-growing plant native to the island of Mauritius. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and yellowish to orange-colored flower heads. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its flowers are short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
