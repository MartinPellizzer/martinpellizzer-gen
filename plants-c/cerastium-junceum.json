    "intro": "Cerastium junceum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cerastium junceum is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
