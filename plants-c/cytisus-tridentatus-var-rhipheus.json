    "intro": "Cytisus tridentatus var. rhipheus, commonly known as the red flame broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is typically found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and scrublands. It is adapted to Mediterranean climates and has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils. The plant is also known for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
