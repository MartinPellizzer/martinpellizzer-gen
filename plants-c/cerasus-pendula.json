    "intro": "Cerasus pendula, commonly known as the weeping cherry or weeping peach, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that create a graceful, weeping appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible red berries in late summer. Its leaves are ovate and turn yellow in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. Cerasus pendula is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
