    "intro": "Cactus conoideus, commonly known as the Easter cactus, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its segmented stems that form a compact, bushy structure. The plant produces vibrant, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Cactus conoideus thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
