    "intro": "Calais parryi, commonly known as the Parry's cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating remarkable drought tolerance. Its foliage consists of fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, while its flowers bloom during the spring and early summer. Calais parryi plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
