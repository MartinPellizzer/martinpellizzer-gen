    "intro": "Crotalaria hildebrandtii, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a slender, branched stem and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed soils. Its seeds are enclosed in a hard, leathery pod, and the plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Crotalaria hildebrandtii plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
