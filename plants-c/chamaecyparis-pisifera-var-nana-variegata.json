    "intro": "Chamaecyparis pisifera var. nana-variegata, commonly known as the dwarf Japanese cedar or variegated Japanese cedar, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen conifer. It features attractive, narrow, dark green needles with white or yellow variegation along their edges. The plant has a pyramidal shape and produces small, cone-like structures that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant. Its ornamental value comes from its unique foliage color and compact growth habit."
