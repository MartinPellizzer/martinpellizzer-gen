    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 anticostensis var. minor, commonly known as the lesser Anticostis sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the North Atlantic. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-brown flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along tidal zones and salt marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which help stabilize coastal soils. This variety is closely related to other Carex species found in similar habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of maritime ecosystems."
