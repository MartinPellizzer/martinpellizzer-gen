    "intro": "Cyperus pseudodiaphanus var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower spikes that are often subtended by leaf-like bracts. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common species in riparian zones. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
