It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests, preferring well-drained soils. Its growth habit is compact, with multiple stems arising from the base, and it is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
