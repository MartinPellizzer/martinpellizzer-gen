    "intro": "Cenolophium denudatum, commonly known as the naked spore moss, is a member of the family Dicranaceae. It is a small, terrestrial moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a delicate, creeping habit with slender stems and leaf-like structures called phyllidia. Its spore capsules are naked, meaning they lack a protective calyptra, which is a distinctive botanical feature. Cenolophium denudatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
