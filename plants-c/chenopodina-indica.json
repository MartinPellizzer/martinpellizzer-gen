    "intro": "Chenopodina indica, commonly known as Indian gooseberry or amla, is a deciduous shrub native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that give way to the distinctive yellow fruit, which is rich in vitamin C. The fruit's surface is covered with tiny tubercles, and it contains a single seed. This plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a resilient species in challenging environments."
