    "intro": "Coryphantha scheeri var. robustispina, commonly known as the robust spiny coryphantha, is a compact cacti species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with prominent, straight spines that are often reddish in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, round fruits. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to dry environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh conditions."
