    "intro": "Corytholoma canescens, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Corytholoma canescens is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
