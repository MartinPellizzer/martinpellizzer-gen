    "intro": "Cyrtochilum cochleatum, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique spiral-shaped flowers, which are often a striking combination of white and purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a compact growth habit. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the forest floor, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Cyrtochilum cochleatum is a relatively rare species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
