    "intro": "Clidemia verruculosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Hawaiian velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with showy pink or purple petals, typically blooming in the spring and summer months. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic species in certain ecosystems."
