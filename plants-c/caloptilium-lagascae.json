    "intro": "Caloptilium lagascae, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Caloptilium lagascae plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained soils."
