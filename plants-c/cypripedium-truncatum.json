    "intro": "Cypripedium truncatum, commonly known as the dwarf lady's slipper, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper, a feature that plays a role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest floors, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with a distinct, truncate shape at the base. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
