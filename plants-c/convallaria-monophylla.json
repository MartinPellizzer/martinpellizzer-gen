    "intro": "Convallaria monophylla, commonly known as lily of the valley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to woodland areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged in a basal rosette. Its stems are slender and often arching, supporting the flowers at the tips. The berries that follow the flowers are bright red and contain the plant's toxic seeds."
