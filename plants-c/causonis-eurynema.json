    "intro": "Causonis eurynema, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming during the warm months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Causonis eurynema plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
