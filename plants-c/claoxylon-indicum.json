    "intro": "Claoxylon indicum, commonly known as the Indian ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has simple, alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by globose, woody fruits. Claoxylon indicum is often found in moist, well-drained soils in tropical and subtropical regions."
