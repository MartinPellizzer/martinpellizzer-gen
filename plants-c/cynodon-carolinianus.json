    "intro": "Cynodon carolinianus, commonly known as tall seaside grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. This plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal prairies. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and preventing erosion. Cynodon carolinianus is also adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding, making it a hardy and resilient species."
