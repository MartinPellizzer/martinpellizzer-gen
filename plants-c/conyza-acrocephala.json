    "intro": "Conyza acrocephala, commonly known as Common Daisy or Goatweed, is an annual flowering plant native to Africa, but now widespread in many parts of the world. It is characterized by its small, white to yellowish composite flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in the summer months. The plant has finely divided, hairy leaves and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in some regions, impacting native plant communities."
