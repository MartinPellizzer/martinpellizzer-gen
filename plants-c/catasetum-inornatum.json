    "intro": "Catasetum inornatum, commonly known as the plain cat slip orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a specialized column that facilitates pollination by certain species of bees. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or green with a contrasting lip, and it produces small, round pseudobulbs. Catasetum inornatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation under proper conditions."
