    "intro": "Cocos lilliputiana, commonly known as the dwarf coconut tree, is a small palm species native to certain tropical regions. It is characterized by its slender trunk and narrow, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, ornamental fruits that are not typically used for coconut oil or water. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to its compact size, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes."
