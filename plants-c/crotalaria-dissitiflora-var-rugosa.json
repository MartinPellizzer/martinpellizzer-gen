    "intro": "Crotalaria dissitiflora var. rugosa, commonly known as the hairy crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and palmate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces clusters of yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. This species is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain environments."
