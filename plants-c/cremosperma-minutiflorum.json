    "intro": "Cremosperma minutiflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered creamcup, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, a common feature among members of the carrot family. Cremosperma minutiflorum is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
