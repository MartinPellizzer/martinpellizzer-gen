    "intro": "Crataegus pseudoheterophylla subsp. turcomanica, commonly known as the Turkestan hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which includes both juvenile and adult leaves with different shapes, a phenomenon known as heterophyllous variation. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in spring, followed by red or orange berries in the autumn. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological adaptations and ecological significance in its native range."
