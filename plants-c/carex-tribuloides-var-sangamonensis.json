    "intro": "Carex tribuloides var. sangamonensis, commonly known as the Sangamon sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense clumps, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear greenish to brownish flowers. It is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological stability of these habitats. This variety is notable for its ability to tolerate periodic flooding and its role in filtering water and supporting local wildlife."
