    "intro": "Cardamine tuberosa subsp. cognata, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and alpine meadows. The plant features basal leaves that are palmately divided, with a rosette structure that helps it retain moisture. Its flowers are bright yellow, with five sepals and petals, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
