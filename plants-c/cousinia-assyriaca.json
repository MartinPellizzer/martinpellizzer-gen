    "intro": "Cousinia assyriaca, commonly known as the Assyrian cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its foliage is covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cousinia assyriaca produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer."
