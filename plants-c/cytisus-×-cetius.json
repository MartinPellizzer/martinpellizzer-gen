    "intro": "Cytisus \u00d7 cetius, commonly known as the hybrid broom, is a shrub resulting from the cross between Cytisus scoparius and Cytisus monogynus. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and coastal areas. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in native ecosystems."
