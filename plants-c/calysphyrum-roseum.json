    "intro": "Calysphyrum roseum, commonly known as the roseum plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often with hairy stems and opposite leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
