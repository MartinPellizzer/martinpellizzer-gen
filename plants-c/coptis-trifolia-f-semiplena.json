    "intro": "Coptis trifolia f. semiplena, commonly known as the semi-double leaf goldthread, is a variant of the golden thread plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. This plant belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, trifoliate leaves that are slightly lobed and often have a waxy texture. The semi-double form refers to its flowers, which have a more complex arrangement of petals compared to the typical single-layered blooms. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with partial shade. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of berberine in its roots."
