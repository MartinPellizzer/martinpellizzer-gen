    "intro": "Coquebertia, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Coquebertia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value contribute to its popularity among gardeners in arid regions."
