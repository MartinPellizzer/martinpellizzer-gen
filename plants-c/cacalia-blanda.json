    "intro": "Cacalia blanda, commonly known as the common bluebell, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and finely divided leaves. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring, often forming a loose cluster at the top of the stem. Cacalia blanda thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
