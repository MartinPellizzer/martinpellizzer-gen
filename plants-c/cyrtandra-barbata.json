    "intro": "Cyrtandra barbata, commonly known as the hairy cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an herb or shrub, often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a rough, hairy texture, which contributes to its common name.
