It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Native to Arctic and alpine regions, it thrives in cold, moist environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats."
