    "intro": "Coffea parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved coffee. It is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family, native to tropical regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. The plant is characterized by its small, ovate leaves and produces small white or pinkish flowers. Its fruits are berries that contain two seeds, which are used to make coffee. Due to its limited cultivation and genetic diversity, it is considered a rare and less commercially important coffee species."
