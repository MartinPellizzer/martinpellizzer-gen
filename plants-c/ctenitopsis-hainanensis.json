It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves and a striking inflorescence that includes a spadix and a spathe. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its distinct morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires protection to ensure its survival."
