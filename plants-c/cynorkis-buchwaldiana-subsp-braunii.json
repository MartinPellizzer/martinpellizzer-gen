    "intro": "Cynorkis buchwaldiana subsp. braunii, commonly known as the Braun's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It is native to the humid lowland forests of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
