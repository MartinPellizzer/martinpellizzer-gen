    "intro": "Catopsis sessiliflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved catopsis, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and features dark green, narrow leaves that are often curved. The plant produces small, yellowish-green capsules that are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or on rocky substrates. Catopsis sessiliflora plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
