    "intro": "Cecropia pittieri, commonly known as the giant ceiba, is a fast-growing tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its massive, buttressed roots and a smooth, light gray bark that often has a flaky texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary and secondary rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it plays a significant role in ecological succession."
