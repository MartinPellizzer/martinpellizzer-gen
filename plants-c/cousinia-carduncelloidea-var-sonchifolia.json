    "intro": "Cousinia carduncelloidea var. sonchifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf dwarf cardoon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features a robust, upright stem covered in dense, silver-gray hairs that provide a protective layer against intense sunlight and water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are narrow, spoon-shaped, and also covered in a fine layer of white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is adapted to dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
