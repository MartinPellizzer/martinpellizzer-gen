    "intro": "Cousinia nischapurensis, commonly known as the Nischapur cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit with tightly packed, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and intense sunlight. Cousinia nischapurensis plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
