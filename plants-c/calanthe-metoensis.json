    "intro": "Calanthe metoensis, commonly known as the Metoense Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Calanthe metoensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
