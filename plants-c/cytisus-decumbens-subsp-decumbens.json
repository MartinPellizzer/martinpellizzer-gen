It features small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy plant in arid environments."
