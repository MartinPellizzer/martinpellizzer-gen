    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 vailiae, commonly known as the Vail's hawthorn, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Crataegus monogyna and Crataegus laevigata. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters. The plant is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pinkish flowers in the spring. It produces small, red berries in the autumn, which are edible but often tart. Crataegus \u00d7 vailiae is native to the United Kingdom and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges."
