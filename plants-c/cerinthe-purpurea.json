It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and the flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. Cerinthe purpurea is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
