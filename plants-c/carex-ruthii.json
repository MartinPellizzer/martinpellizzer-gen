    "intro": "Carex ruthii, commonly known as the Ruth's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are pollinated by wind. Carex ruthii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
