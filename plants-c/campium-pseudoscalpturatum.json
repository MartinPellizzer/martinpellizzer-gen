    "intro": "Campium pseudoscalpturatum, commonly known as the false scalpturated campium, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the Campanulaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its flowers are usually blue or violet in color, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Campium pseudoscalpturatum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
