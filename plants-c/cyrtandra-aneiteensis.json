    "intro": "Cyrtandra aneiteensis, commonly known as the Aneitei Cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to Hawaii. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Cyrtandra aneiteensis is known for its vibrant orange or yellow floral colors, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
