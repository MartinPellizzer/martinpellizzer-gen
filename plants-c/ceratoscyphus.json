    "intro": "Ceratoscyphus, commonly known as the horned shield fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, shield-shaped leaves that often have a waxy texture. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in wetlands and marshy areas. Ceratoscyphus species typically produce small, clustered flowers that are surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in moist, shady garden environments."
