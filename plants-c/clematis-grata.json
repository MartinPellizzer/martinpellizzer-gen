    "intro": "Clematis grata, commonly known as the sweet scent clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to Europe and western Asia. It features slender, twining stems that can grow up to 6 meters in length, supporting its showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blooms in shades of white, pink, and lavender, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three heart-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system that helps anchor it to support structures. Clematis grata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and requires well-drained soil and partial shade for optimal growth."
