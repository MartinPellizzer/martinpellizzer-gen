    "intro": "Carduus alpicola, commonly known as the alpine thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and large, spiny leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces purple to violet flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in rocky or gravelly environments at high elevations."
