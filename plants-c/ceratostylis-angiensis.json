    "intro": "Ceratostylis angiensis, commonly known as the Angilis spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Guinea. It features a slender, hairy rhizome and produces a single, erect stem that bears a few lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a greenish-yellow lip and a distinctive, spidery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats and is often found in rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
