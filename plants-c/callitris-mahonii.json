It is characterized by its scale-like leaves and cone-bearing structure, typical of the Cupressaceae family. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a conical crown. Its bark is fibrous and often peels in strips, while its wood is valued for its durability and resistance to decay.
