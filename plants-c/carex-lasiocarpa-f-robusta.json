    "intro": "Carex lasiocarpa f. robusta, commonly known as the rough-haired sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its erect, grass-like stems and narrow, strap-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, rough hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-brown flowers, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for wetland restoration and ornamental landscaping in water-rich environments."
