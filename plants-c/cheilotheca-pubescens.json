    "intro": "Cheilotheca pubescens, commonly known as the hairy cheilotheca, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments, such as forest floors or wetlands. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations that help it retain moisture and reduce water loss. The flowers are usually white or pale green, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
