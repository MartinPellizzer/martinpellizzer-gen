    "intro": "Cyrtandra sarawakensis, commonly known as the Sarawak Cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant is often found in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid and nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its humid habitat. Cyrtandra sarawakensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
