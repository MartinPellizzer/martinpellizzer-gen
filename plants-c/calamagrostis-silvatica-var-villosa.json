It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and soft, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the summer, which are arranged in panicle-like clusters. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its graceful, flowing form."
