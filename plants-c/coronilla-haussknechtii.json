    "intro": "Coronilla haussknechtii, commonly known as the Hausknecht's vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, and it has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. Its hardy nature and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and wildlife habitats."
