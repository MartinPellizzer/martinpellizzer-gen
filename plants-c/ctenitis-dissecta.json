    "intro": "Ctenitis dissecta, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are finely divided, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant has a slender, unbranched trunk that is covered in a layer of persistent, fibrous roots. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a soft blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique trait makes Ctenitis dissecta a fascinating subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
