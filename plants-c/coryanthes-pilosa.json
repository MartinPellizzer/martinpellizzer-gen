    "intro": "Coryanthes pilosa, commonly known as the hairy coryanthe, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, with vibrant red or orange hues and intricate patterns. The plant has a unique structure with a specialized column that supports its pollination mechanism, attracting specific insect pollinators. Its leaves are typically broad and dark green, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in humid environments. Coryanthes pilosa thrives in shaded, moist conditions and requires careful cultivation to mimic its natural habitat."
