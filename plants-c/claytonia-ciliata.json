It features small, rosette-forming leaves that are hairy and often have a distinctive notched or toothed edge. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Claytonia ciliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
