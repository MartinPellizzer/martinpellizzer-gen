    "intro": "Cranfillia phanerophlebia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with long, slender leaves and a single, showy white or pale green flower. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, instead relying on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its specialized root system, known as a mycorrhizal association, helps it absorb nutrients from the environment. Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
