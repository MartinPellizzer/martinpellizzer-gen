It features fleshy, thick leaves that are typically green with a reddish or orange tinge, especially when exposed to bright light. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by seed capsules. Its leaves are often used in rock gardens due to their ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements.
