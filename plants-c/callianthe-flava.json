    "intro": "Callianthe flava, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a vibrant touch to its rocky or sandy habitat. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to absorb moisture from the soil efficiently. Callianthe flava is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in disturbed or dry soils."
