    "intro": "Corryocactus quadrangularis, commonly known as the angular cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are typically green or blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It has a slow growth rate and is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping. Due to its distinctive appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular ornamental plant in dry climates."
