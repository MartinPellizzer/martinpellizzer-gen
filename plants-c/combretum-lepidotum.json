    "intro": "Combretum lepidotum, commonly known as the white flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
