    "intro": "Calamagrostis brevipaleata, commonly known as the dwarf reedgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, upright stems covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden bracts, which bloom in late summer. Its narrow leaves are grass-like, with a bluish-green hue and a rough texture. It is often found in moist soils near streams, wetlands, and disturbed areas, making it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
