    "intro": "Chamaescilla corymbosa var. corymbosa, commonly known as the coastal dune everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming habit and small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune systems where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
