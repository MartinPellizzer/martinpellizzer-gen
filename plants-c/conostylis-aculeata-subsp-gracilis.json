It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its narrow, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and coastal dunes. Its foliage is generally glabrous, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is noted for its ecological importance in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
