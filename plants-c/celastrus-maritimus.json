    "intro": "Celastrus maritimus, commonly known as sea bindweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States. It is a woody vine that typically grows along shores and in sandy soils, adapting to saline and windy environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Sea bindweed is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, which can stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
