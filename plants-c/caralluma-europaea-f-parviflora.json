    "intro": "Caralluma europaea f. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered European prickly pear, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to dry, rocky soils."
