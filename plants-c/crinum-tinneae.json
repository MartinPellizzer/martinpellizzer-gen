    "intro": "Crinum tinneae, commonly known as the African lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, often with a distinctive greenish tinge. The plant produces a tall, erect stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with narrow, strap-like leaves. Its bulbs are fleshy and store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Crinum tinneae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
