    "intro": "Codonorchis lessonii, commonly known as the Lesson's\u6753\u5170, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, hooded flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats, thriving in rich, well-drained soils. It has a short flowering period in late spring to early summer, during which it produces a single, showy bloom. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
