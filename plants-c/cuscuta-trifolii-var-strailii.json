    "intro": "Cuscuta trifolii var. strailii, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hairless stems. The plant is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants, forming dense mats that can smother its hosts. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means, allowing it to spread across various environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants."
