It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a shallow root system that attaches to the roots of other plants, allowing it to obtain some of its nutrients. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in its native ecosystem."
