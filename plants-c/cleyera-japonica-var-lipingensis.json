    "intro": "Cleyera japonica var. lipingensis, commonly known as the Liping holly, is a rare variant of the Japanese cleyera. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. It is native to China, specifically the Guangxi region, and thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
