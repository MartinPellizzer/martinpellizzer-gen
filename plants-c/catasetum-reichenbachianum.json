    "intro": "Catasetum reichenbachianum, commonly known as the Reichenbach's Catasetum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. The plant produces a unique structure called a \"column,\" which is specialized for pollination by certain species of bees. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Catasetum reichenbachianum is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
