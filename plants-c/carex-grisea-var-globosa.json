It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spherical clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually gray-green in color and have a distinctive waxy coating. The inflorescence is often adorned with a single, prominent, rounded flower head that is both ornamental and ecologically significant."
