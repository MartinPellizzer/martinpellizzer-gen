    "intro": "Capparis platyacantha, commonly known as the flat-leaved caper, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with woody stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. Capparis platyacantha is often found in rocky soils and can tolerate drought conditions."
