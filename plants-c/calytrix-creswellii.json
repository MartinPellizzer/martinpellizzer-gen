    "intro": "Calytrix creswellii, commonly known as the pink-flowered rock heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand dry conditions, making it suitable for coastal and sandy soils. It is often found in heathlands and on rocky outcrops, thriving in full sun. Calytrix creswellii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native pollinators."
