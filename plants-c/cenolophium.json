    "intro": "Cenolophium, commonly known as the horned poppy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Papaveraceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, spurred petals that resemble horns, giving them their common name. Cenolophium species typically grow in rocky or arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. They produce showy flowers in a range of colors, including red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The genus includes several species, with Cenolophium affine and Cenolophium microcarpum being among the most well-known."
