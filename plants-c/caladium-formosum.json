    "intro": "Caladium formosum, commonly known as the Chinese heartleaf caladium, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that come in a variety of colors, including red, pink, and white. The plant belongs to the Araceae family and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant. Its foliage is the primary feature, as it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Caladium formosum thrives in warm, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
