    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 adrienne, commonly known as the Adrienne orchid, is a hybrid orchid species originating from crosses between Cattleya labiata and Cattleya mossiae. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant pink and white hues with a distinctive yellow lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts seeking seasonal blooms."
