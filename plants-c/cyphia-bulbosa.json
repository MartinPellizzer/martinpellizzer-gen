    "intro": "Cyphia bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous cyphia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its bulb-like underground storage organ, which helps it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and rockeries."
