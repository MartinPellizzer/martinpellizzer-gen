    "intro": "Castilleja inverta, commonly known as the inverted castilleja, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small and often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Castilleja inverta plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators and contributing to plant community diversity."
