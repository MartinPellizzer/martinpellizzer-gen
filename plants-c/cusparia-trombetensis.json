    "intro": "Cusparia trombetensis, commonly known as the Tumbes cusparia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of northern Peru. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in sandy soils along the coastline, where it is adapted to saline and windy conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the dry season. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
