It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle the plant with care."
