    "intro": "Carex pauciflora var. macroglossa, commonly known as the broad-lip sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and specialized flowering structures called spikes. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a dense cluster of small, inconspicuous flowers at the top. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in wetland habitats. This variety is distinguished by its broader, more prominent floral bracts compared to the typical form of C. pauciflora."
