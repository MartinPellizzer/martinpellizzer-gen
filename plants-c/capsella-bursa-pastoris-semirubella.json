    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris semirubella, commonly known as the red-stemmed weed or a variant of common chickweed, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate or upright growth habit, with hairy stems and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, heart-shaped cotyledons and has alternate, oval leaves with serrated edges. It is a annual or biennial herb that thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, bladder-like structure called a silique, which aids in seed dispersal."
