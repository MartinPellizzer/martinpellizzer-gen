    "intro": "Cousinia subpectinata, commonly known as the silky hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to stabilize sandy soils, making it a valuable species for erosion control. Cousinia subpectinata is also noted for its ornamental value, often cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal."
