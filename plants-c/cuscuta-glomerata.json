    "intro": "Cuscuta glomerata, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and often infests crops and ornamental plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its widespread distribution. Cuscuta glomerata plays a role in ecological systems but can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
