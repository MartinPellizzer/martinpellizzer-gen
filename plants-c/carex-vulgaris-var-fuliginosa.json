It features dark, glossy leaves that are typically dark green to blackish in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are usually green or brown. It thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in areas with standing water. Black sedge is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wetland organisms."
