    "intro": "Craspedaria serpens, commonly known as the snake's head fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and its distinctive, lanceolate fronds that often curl at the tips. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are usually green, with a slightly serrated margin, and it produces small, sporangia-bearing structures on the underside of its fronds. Craspedaria serpens is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
