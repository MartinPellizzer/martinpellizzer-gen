    "intro": "Carthamoides, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairless stem. The plant produces a cluster of small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy white seed heads. It is native to Europe and Asia but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. Carthamoides is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a source of food."
