    "intro": "Calycothrix monticola, commonly known as the mountain calycothrix, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler, temperate climates. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers are usually pink or purple in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calycothrix monticola is considered a vulnerable species."
