    "intro": "Calantica chauvetiae, commonly known as the Chauvet's calantica, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants such as carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, umbel-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are usually white or pale pink, adding a subtle beauty to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
