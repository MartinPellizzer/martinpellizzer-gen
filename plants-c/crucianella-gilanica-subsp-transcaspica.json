    "intro": "Crucianella gilanica subsp. transcaspica, commonly known as the Transcaspian bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, facilitating its carnivorous lifestyle. This subspecies is native to the Caspian Sea region and thrives in shallow, freshwater environments. Its leaves are typically small and floating, with specialized structures for buoyancy and nutrient absorption. The plant plays a role in its ecosystem by controlling microorganism populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
