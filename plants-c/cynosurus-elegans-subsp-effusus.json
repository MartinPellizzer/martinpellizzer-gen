It features fine, soft, and silky-textured leaves that are typically light green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are usually arranged in dense, compact clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
