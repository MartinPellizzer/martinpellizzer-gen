    "intro": "Cracca mariana, commonly known as the marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has heart-shaped, broad leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in damp environments. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
