    "intro": "Cantua cuzcoensis, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to retain moisture in its harsh habitat. Cantua cuzcoensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
