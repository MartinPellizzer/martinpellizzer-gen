    "intro": "Cyathea walkerae var. tripinnata, commonly known as the tripinnate tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically tripinnate, meaning they have a secondary division of pinnae, giving the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
