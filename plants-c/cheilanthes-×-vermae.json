    "intro": "Cheilanthes \u00d7 vermae, commonly known as the hybrid rock fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Cheilanthes lanata and Cheilanthes tomentosa. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to harsh conditions."
