The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments, often growing near the shoreline or in mangrove swamps. Its leaves are typically dark green and can reach lengths of up to 2 meters, contributing to its striking appearance. Ctenopteris alsophilicola plays a vital ecological role in coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
