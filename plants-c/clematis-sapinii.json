    "intro": "Clematis sapinii, commonly known as the Alpine Clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 10 meters, allowing it to climb and spread across rocky outcrops. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value. Clematis sapinii thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for alpine gardens."
