    "intro": "Chylismia cardiophylla subsp. cardiophylla, commonly known as the heartleaf chylismia, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are typically velvety and dark green. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
