    "intro": "Corysanthera atrosanguinea, commonly known as the black blood orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, flowers that contrast sharply with its green foliage. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bloom during the warmer months. Its unique coloration and rarity make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in its native range."
