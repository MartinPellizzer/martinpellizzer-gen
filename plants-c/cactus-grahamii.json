    "intro": "Cactus grahamii, commonly known as the Graham's cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Cactus grahamii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and aesthetic appeal."
