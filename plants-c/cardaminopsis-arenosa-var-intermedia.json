    "intro": "Cardaminopsis arenosa var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate rock chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, basal rosette of hairy, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky crevices or on slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny environments."
