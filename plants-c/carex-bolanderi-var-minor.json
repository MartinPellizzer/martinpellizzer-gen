    "intro": "Carex bolanderi var. minor, commonly known as Bolander's sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Native to the western United States, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it a valuable component of wetland ecosystems."
