    "intro": "Chascotheca domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican chascotheca, is a species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and is known for its hairy stems and leaves. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom during the warmer months and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable and is of interest to botanists studying tropical flora."
