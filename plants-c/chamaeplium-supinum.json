    "intro": "Chamaeplium supinum, commonly known as the creeping mountain avens, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, rounded leaves that are often hairy and arranged in a rosette. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and capable of forming dense colonies, which help stabilize soil in rocky or alpine environments. Chamaeplium supinum is adapted to cool, moist conditions and is often found in woodland and meadow habitats."
