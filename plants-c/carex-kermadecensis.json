    "intro": "Carex kermadecensis, commonly known as the Kermadec sedge, is a perennial plant native to the Kermadec Islands in the South Pacific. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, coastal environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinct midrib, and it produces small, clustered flowers in early spring. Carex kermadecensis is notable for its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native habitat."
