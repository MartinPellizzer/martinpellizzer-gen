    "intro": "Cerastium arvense subsp. glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy leaves and white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its glandular hairs, which give it a sticky texture and help in water retention. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
