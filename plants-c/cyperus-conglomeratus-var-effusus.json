It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and slender, cylindrical stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it thrives in wet or marshy environments. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for erosion control or as a ornamental plant."
