    "intro": "Colletia horrida, commonly known as the hairy colletia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often followed by small, red fruits. Its thick, fleshy leaves are modified into spines, helping it to conserve moisture in harsh environments. Colletia horrida is well adapted to desert conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
