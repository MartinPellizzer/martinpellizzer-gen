    "intro": "Ctenopteris subscabra, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea holly, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near coastal areas or in humid forests. Ctenopteris subscabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
