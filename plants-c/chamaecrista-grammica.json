    "intro": "Chamaecrista grammica, commonly known as the narrowleaf burr legume, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, compound leaves with a distinctive linear shape. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, followed by bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. Chamaecrista grammica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
