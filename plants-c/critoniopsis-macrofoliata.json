    "intro": "Critoniopsis macrofoliata, commonly known as the large-leaf critoniopsis, is a species of flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
