    "intro": "Chamaerops humilis var. tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy date palm, is a compact, slow-growing palm native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense,\u4e1b\u751f (clumping) growth habit and short, stout stems that often remain close to the ground. The leaves are fan-shaped, with a hairy texture that gives the plant its common name, and they are typically a deep green color. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and small spaces due to its compact size and ornamental foliage. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
