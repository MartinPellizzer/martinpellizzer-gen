    "intro": "Cactus micromeris, commonly known as the small-leaf cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a typical adaptation for water conservation in arid environments. Cactus micromeris thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping."
