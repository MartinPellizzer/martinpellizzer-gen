    "intro": "Cassytha polysperma, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers and has a distinctive, thread-like appearance due to its slender stems. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions and can be found growing on a variety of host species, including grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread widely across different environments. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant populations and providing resources for certain insect species."
