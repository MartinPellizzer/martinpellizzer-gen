It belongs to the cypress family (Cupressaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, scale-like leaves and conical shape. The plant is known for its slow growth and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates. It has limited natural distribution and is considered a relict species with historical significance in botanical studies. Due to its rarity, it is of interest to conservationists and horticulturists alike."
