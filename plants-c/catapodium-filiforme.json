    "intro": "Catapodium filiforme, commonly known as the slender catapodium, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its thin, thread-like leaves that grow in dense clusters, forming a low-growing mat. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
