    "intro": "Commiphora gallaensis, commonly known as the Ethiopian frankincense tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap, which is harvested for its medicinal and aromatic properties. The plant typically grows in rocky and semi-arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are elliptical and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), with a smooth texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The resin, known as guggle, has been used traditionally in Ethiopian culture for incense, medicine, and as a preservative."
