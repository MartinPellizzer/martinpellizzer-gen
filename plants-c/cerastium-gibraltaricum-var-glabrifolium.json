    "intro": "Cerastium gibraltaricum var. glabrifolium, commonly known as Gibraltar stonecress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky habitats of the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring, typically in shades of white or pale pink. The leaves are ovate and often covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabrifolium has reduced hair, giving it a smoother texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to Mediterranean climates. This plant is often found in limestone areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect life."
