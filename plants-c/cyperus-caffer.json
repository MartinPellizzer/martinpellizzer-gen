    "intro": "Cyperus caffer, commonly known as the African umbrella plant, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its erect, grass-like stems and dense, umbrella-shaped clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy areas, often near water bodies, and is adapted to thrive in humid environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in wetlands and along riverbanks. The leaves are linear and stiff, contributing to its distinctive appearance and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
