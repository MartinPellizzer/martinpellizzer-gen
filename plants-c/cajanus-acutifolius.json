It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated pods containing several seeds, which are used as a food source in some parts of the world. Cajanus acutifolius is adapted to grow in poor soils and can thrive in arid conditions. It also plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility."
