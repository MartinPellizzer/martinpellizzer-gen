    "intro": "Columnea dressleri, commonly known as the Christmas bell, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It features pendulous, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with contrasting yellow or white markings. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea dressleri is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
