    "intro": "Calystegia subvolubilis var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered morning glory, is a climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped white flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth habit makes it an effective ground cover but also a potential weed in gardens. The flowers emit a mild fragrance and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
