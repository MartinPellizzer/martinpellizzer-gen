It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits that contain one or two seeds. It thrives in brackish or saline water, often forming dense colonies in mangrove swamps. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
