    "intro": "Calyptranthes arenicola, commonly known as the sand dune calyptranthes, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is adapted to grow in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. The plant features simple, elliptic to ovate leaves that are usually gray-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Calyptranthes arenicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
