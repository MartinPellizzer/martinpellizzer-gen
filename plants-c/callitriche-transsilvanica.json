    "intro": "Callitriche transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian water-star, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Europe. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often near streams, ponds, or wet meadows. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, star-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 centimeter in diameter. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, which are characteristic of the Callitriche genus. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
