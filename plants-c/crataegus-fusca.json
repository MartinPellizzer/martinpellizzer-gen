    "intro": "Crataegus fusca, commonly known as the black hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 12 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins, and turn yellow in the fall. Crataegus fusca is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and moist soils, and it is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
