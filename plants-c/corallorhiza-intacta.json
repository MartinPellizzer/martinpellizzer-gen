    "intro": "Corallorhiza intacta, commonly known as the pink root, is a member of the orchid family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph. It relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. The plant produces a single, showy pink or purple flower with a distinctive spurred lip. It is typically found in shaded, forested areas where it can access the necessary fungal associations. Due to its specialized growth requirements, it is often considered a rare and elusive species."
