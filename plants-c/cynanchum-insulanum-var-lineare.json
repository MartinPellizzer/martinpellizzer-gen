    "intro": "Cynanchum insulanum var. lineare, commonly known as the linear milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant features slender, linear leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
