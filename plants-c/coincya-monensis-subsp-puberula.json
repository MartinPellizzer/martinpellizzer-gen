    "intro": "Coincya monensis subsp. puberula, commonly known as the velvet water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its flowers are tiny and clustered in dense inflorescences, often submerged or floating at the water's surface. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
