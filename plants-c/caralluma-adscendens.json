    "intro": "Caralluma adscendens, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Africa. It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its branching stems that resemble a backbone, hence its common name. The plant features small, fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that help it store water, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters during the rainy season. Caralluma adscendens is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
