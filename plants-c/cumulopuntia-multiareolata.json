    "intro": "Cumulopuntia multiareolata, commonly known as the many-areola cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems with numerous areoles, which are the small, raised structures from which spines, flowers, and branches emerge. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its green stems. Its spines are typically pale or whitish, providing a protective adaptation against herbivores and intense sunlight. This cactus is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems for survival in its harsh environment."
