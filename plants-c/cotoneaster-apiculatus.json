    "intro": "Cotoneaster apiculatus, commonly known as the pointed cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It features small, oval leaves that are typically dark green and have a pointed tip. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the autumn. Cotoneaster apiculatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its seasonal interest. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
