    "intro": "Cleistocactus hildegardiae, commonly known as the Hildegard's closed-cactus, is a species of cactus native to the dry regions of northern Argentina. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that open only at night, a feature that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
