    "intro": "Crocus odorus var. longiflorus, commonly known as the sweet violet, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a fragrant, sweet scent, which is highly valued in perfumery. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that allow it to survive harsh winters. The variety is characterized by its elongated floral stems and is often cultivated for ornamental and aromatic purposes."
