It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves with five distinct veins running along the length of each leaf blade. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is native to parts of South America, particularly in regions with temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it prefers well-drained soil and full sun."
