It is characterized by its basal rosette of spiny, hairy leaves that clasping the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flower heads that bloom in late summer. Its foliage is typically gray-green with a woolly texture, and the stems are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. This subspecies is native to parts of Europe and is often found in dry, rocky soils in open habitats."
