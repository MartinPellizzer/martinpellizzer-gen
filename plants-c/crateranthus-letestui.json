It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the stems are often hairy, providing a distinctive appearance.
