    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 pallens, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the center. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and meadows. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Cypripedium \u00d7 pallens is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
