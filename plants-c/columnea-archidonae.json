    "intro": "Columnea archidonae, commonly known as the Archidona flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, attracting hummingbirds and other pollinators. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, clinging to tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, often with a slight waxy coating. Columnea archidonae thrives in warm, moist conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
