    "intro": "Cercestis congensis, commonly known as the Congo orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the rainforests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant, and often colorful flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the dense canopy of the rainforest. Its botanical features include narrow, strap-like leaves and a short, wiry stem. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
