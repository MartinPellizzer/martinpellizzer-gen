    "intro": "Corybas dienemus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unusual member of the orchid family. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that produces striking, hood-like flowers with a distinctive dark coloration. The plant is native to the wet tropical rainforests of Australia and is often found growing in shaded, moist environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered a vulnerable species."
