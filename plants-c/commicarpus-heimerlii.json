    "intro": "Commicarpus heimerlii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, round seeds. Commicarpus heimerlii is adapted to survive in extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
