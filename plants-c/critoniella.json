It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is notable for its striking, pale blue or white flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. Due to its rarity and unique adaptations, Critoniella is considered a subject of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts."
