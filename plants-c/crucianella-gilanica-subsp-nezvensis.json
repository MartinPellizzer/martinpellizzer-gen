    "intro": "Crucianella gilanica subsp. nezvensis, commonly known as the Gilan endemic bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the Caspian Sea region. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for trapping prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowers are small and often pink or white. This subspecies is of particular interest due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native environment."
