    "intro": "Ctenitis costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican hawksbeard, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to Central America, particularly Costa Rica, and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Its reproductive structures include both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Ctenitis costaricensis is adapted to humid tropical climates and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
