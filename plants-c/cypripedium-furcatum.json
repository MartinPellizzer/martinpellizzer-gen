    "intro": "Cypripedium furcatum, commonly known as the forked lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-shaped lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually broad and leathery, and it produces a single flower per stem, which blooms in late spring or early summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
