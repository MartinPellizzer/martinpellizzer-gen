    "intro": "Cracca juncea, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is an annual herb that grows up to 30 centimeters tall, featuring slender stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is characterized by its feathery leaves and its ability to thrive in disturbed soils, often found in grasslands and along roadsides. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across various habitats."
