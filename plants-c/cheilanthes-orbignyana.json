    "intro": "Cheilanthes orbignyana, commonly known as the rock fern or orbignyana rock fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows on rocky substrates in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form with dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white tomentum. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. This species is found in various regions of the Americas, including Mexico and parts of South America."
