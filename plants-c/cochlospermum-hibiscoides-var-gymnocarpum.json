    "intro": "Cochlospermum hibiscoides var. gymnocarpum, commonly known as the smooth-seeded glorybower, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often resembling those of hibiscus species. The plant produces capsule fruits that are smooth and lack the hairy covering found in other varieties of Cochlospermum. Its leaves are typically ovate or elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface depending on the variety. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils in full sun."
