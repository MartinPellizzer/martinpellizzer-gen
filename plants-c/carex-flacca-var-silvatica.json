    "intro": "Carex flacca var. silvatica, commonly known as the silky sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America, particularly found in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, swamps, and along stream banks. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that is typically soft and silky to the touch, with narrow, grass-green leaves that form a low-growing mat. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in full to partial shade and requires consistently moist soil conditions. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
