    "intro": "Cecropia heterochroma, commonly known as the variable cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its large, opposite leaves with prominent veins. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with Azobacter bacteria, which fix atmospheric nitrogen into the soil, enhancing its growth in nutrient-poor environments. Its hollow stems and rapid growth make it an important component of rainforest ecosystems. The plant is also notable for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats, contributing to ecological succession."
