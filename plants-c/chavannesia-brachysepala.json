    "intro": "Chavannesia brachysepala, commonly known as the narrow-sepaled chavannesia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed-like species. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It grows as a shrub or small tree, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
