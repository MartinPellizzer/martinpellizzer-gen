    "intro": "Cirsium niveum, commonly known as the snowdrop thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cirsium niveum is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and ecological importance to pollinators."
