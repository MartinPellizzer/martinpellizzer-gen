    "intro": "Caralluma mammillaris, commonly known as the devil's tongue or hedgehog cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a cylindrical stem covered in small, spiny tubercles that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stem. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for xerophytic gardens and rockeries."
