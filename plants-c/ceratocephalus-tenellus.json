    "intro": "Ceratocephalus tenellus, commonly known as the slender burrweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, spherical seed pods that are covered in hooked bristles, aiding in wind and animal dispersal. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to arid environments."
