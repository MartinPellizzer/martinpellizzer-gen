    "intro": "Cyrtandropsis finisterrae, commonly known as the Canary Islands rock rose, is a rare shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, coastal climates of its habitat. It is classified as an endemic species, found only in specific areas of the Canary Islands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
