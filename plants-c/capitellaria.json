    "intro": "Capitellaria, commonly known as the \"feather moss,\" is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the class Marchantiopsida. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and the presence of small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having specialized structures for water absorption and photosynthesis. Capitellaria thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or on rocky surfaces. Its simple structure and ability to retain moisture make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
