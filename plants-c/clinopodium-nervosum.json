    "intro": "Clinopodium nervosum, commonly known as narrow-veined wood betony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a square, hairy stem that branches near the base, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that have prominent veins. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, typically ranging in color from blue to purple, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Clinopodium nervosum is often found in calcareous soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
