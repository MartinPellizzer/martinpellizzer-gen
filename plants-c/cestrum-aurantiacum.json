    "intro": "Cestrum aurantiacum, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by orange-red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Cestrum aurantiacum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
