It is characterized by its distinctive cyclical arrangement of leaves, which form a rosette pattern around the central stem. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in well-drained soils. Due to its rare occurrence and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species in botanical research and conservation efforts."
