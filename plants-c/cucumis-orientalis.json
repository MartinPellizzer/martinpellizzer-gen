    "intro": "Cucumis orientalis, commonly known as the Persian cucumber, is a flowering plant in the Cucurbitaceae family. It is native to South Asia and is characterized by its long, slender, and often ribbed fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically separate from the female flowers. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture. The fruit is typically harvested when immature, before it fully matures into a cucumber."
