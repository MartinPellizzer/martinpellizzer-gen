    "intro": "Caulanthus californicus, commonly known as the California silversword, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. This perennial herb typically grows in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its silvery foliage gives it a distinctive appearance, and it is often found in rocky or sandy areas along the coast."
