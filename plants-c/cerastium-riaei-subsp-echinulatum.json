    "intro": "Cerastium riaei subsp. echinulatum, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe. It features small, hairy leaves and produces clusters of white flowers with five petals. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along sea cliffs. It is adapted to salt-laden winds and has a compact growth habit to reduce water loss. Its subspecific name, *echinulatum*, refers to the small, spiny structures on its flowers."
