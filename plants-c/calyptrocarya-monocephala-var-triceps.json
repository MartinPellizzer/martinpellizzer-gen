    "intro": "Calyptrocarya monocephala var. triceps, commonly known as the three-lobed cycad, is a unique cycad species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like leaves that are divided into three lobes, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its botanical significance lies in its morphological features and its role in the study of ancient plant evolution. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
