    "intro": "Crassula pustulata, commonly known as the Woolly Crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features small, fleshy, rounded leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Crassula pustulata is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
