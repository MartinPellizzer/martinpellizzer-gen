    "intro": "Cylista piscatoria, commonly known as water clover, is a species of aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are often arranged in a clover-like pattern, floating on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Cylista piscatoria is a perennial plant that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense mats that can provide habitat for aquatic life. It is also used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from the water."
