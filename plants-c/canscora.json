    "intro": "Canscora, commonly known as the mountain nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It comprises several species, most of which are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly in the southern and eastern parts of the continent. The plants are characterized by their erect, often spiny stems and small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or blue. Canscora species are adapted to survive in harsh environments, often with succulent leaves that store water. Some species have been used in traditional medicine for their potential therapeutic properties."
