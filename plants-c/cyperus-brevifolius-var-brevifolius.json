    "intro": "Cyperus brevifolius var. brevifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered spikes that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
