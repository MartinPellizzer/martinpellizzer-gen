    "intro": "Cereus speciosissimus var. seitzii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and spiny, ribbed structure, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted for drought resistance. The plant is often cultivated for its dramatic floral display and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
