    "intro": "Cyrilla silvae, commonly known as the swamp cyrilla, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including swamps and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has simple, opposite, elliptical leaves that turn reddish in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters during the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Cyrilla silvae is valued for its adaptability to wet conditions and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
