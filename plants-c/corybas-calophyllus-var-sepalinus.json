    "intro": "Corybas calophyllus var. sepalinus, commonly known as the Sepaline Helmet Orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the subtropical regions of eastern Australia, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped flowers that are typically dark purple or black in color. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often forming a rosette at the base. This orchid is noted for its specialized pollination mechanism, relying on flies rather than bees, which makes it an intriguing subject for botanical study."
