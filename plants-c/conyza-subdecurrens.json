    "intro": "Conyza subdecurrens, commonly known as the narrowleaf horseweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as fields and roadsides, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, with a hairy surface, and it produces small white to pale yellow flowers in composite clusters. Conyza subdecurrens is often considered a weed but has ecological value as a source of nectar for pollinators."
