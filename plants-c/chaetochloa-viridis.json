    "intro": "Chaetochloa viridis, commonly known as green hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and slender, green blades that often have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in areas with standing water. Chaetochloa viridis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
