    "intro": "Crepidium andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb and produces a single, showy flower per stem. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
