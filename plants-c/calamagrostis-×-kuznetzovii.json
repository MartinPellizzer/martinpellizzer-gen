    "intro": "Calamagrostis \u00d7 kuznetzovii, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and silvery-blue foliage that turns coppery in the fall. The plant produces feathery panicles of small, fluffy flowers in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and erosion control."
