It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. Cassia killipii is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in arid environments."
