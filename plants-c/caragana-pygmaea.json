    "intro": "Caragana pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf bitterbrush, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its small, compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. Its botanical features make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
