    "intro": "Cyclosorus deltipterus, commonly known as the broad-leaved water clover, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged or just at the water's surface. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Cyclosorus deltipterus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
