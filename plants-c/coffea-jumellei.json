    "intro": "Coffea jumellei, commonly known as the Jamaican coffee or Jamaican bitter bean, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica, and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain two seeds, which are used to make a unique, bitter coffee. It is less commonly cultivated than other coffee species due to its low yield and strong flavor profile. Despite its limited commercial use, Coffea jumellei holds cultural significance in the Caribbean region."
