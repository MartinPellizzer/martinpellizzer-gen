    "intro": "Chaetostoma acuminatum, commonly known as the sharp-mouthed pleco, is a species of armored catfish native to the rivers of South America. It is characterized by its elongated body, which is covered in bony plates that provide protection. The fish has a distinctive, elongated snout and a row of sensory barbels along its upper lip. Its coloration is typically dark with a lighter underside, and it exhibits a unique behavior of scraping algae from surfaces using its specialized mouth structure. This species is often kept in aquariums due to its hardy nature and ability to help control algae growth."
