    "intro": "Cestrum amictum var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved cestrum, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often pubescent. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. These flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal moths, and the plant is known for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract wildlife."
