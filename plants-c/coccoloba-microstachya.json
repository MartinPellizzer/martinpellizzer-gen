    "intro": "Coccoloba microstachya, commonly known as the red mangrove or small-stemmed mangrove, is a flowering plant species native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its woody structure and distinctive red or purple stems. The plant thrives in saline environments, often forming dense thickets in mangrove swamps and estuaries. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically clustered in umbels, and it produces a capsule fruit containing numerous seeds. Coccoloba microstachya plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
