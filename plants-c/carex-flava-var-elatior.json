    "intro": "Carex flava var. elatior, commonly known as the tall yellow sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is distinguished by its taller stature compared to the typical Carex flava, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter."
