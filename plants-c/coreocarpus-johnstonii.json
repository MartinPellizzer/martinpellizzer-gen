    "intro": "Coreocarpus johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's coreocarpus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form with dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces striking, cone-like fruits that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the temperate and coastal climates of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
