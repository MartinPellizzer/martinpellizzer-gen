This variety is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, intricately patterned flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing vividly colored petals that range from pink to red. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and requires well-drained conditions to flourish. Due to its beauty and rarity, it is often protected in its natural habitat."
