    "intro": "Crambe, commonly known as turnip rape, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is native to Europe and is characterized by its upright stems and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in cooking or as a source of oil. Crambe is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a useful crop in sustainable farming practices. Its leaves are edible and have a mild, slightly bitter taste."
