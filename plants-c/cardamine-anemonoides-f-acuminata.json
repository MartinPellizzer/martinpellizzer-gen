    "intro": "Cardamine anemonoides f. acuminata, commonly known as the acuminated water shield, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its flowering period occurs in early spring, and it is often found in association with other moisture-loving flora. The subspecies f. acuminata is distinguished by its acuminate (tapering to a point) leaf tips and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
