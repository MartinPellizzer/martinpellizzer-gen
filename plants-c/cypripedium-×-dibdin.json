    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 dibdin, commonly known as the Dibdin's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats and has a long blooming period in late spring. Its leaves are usually broad and strap-like, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
