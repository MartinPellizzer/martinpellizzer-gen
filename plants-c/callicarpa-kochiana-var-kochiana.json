    "intro": "Callicarpa kochiana var. kochiana, commonly known as the Chinese beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. These berries mature in the fall and are a key feature of its ornamental value. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil."
