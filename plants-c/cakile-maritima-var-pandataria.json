    "intro": "Cakile maritima var. pandataria, commonly known as the Pacific sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and along shorelines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems."
