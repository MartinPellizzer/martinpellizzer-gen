    "intro": "Ceropegia constricta, commonly known as the string of hearts or heartleaf ceropegia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or pink markings. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which are pollinated by specific insects. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Ceropegia constricta is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
