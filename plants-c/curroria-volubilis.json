    "intro": "Curroria volubilis, commonly known as the climbing cissus, is a vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and traditional medicine."
