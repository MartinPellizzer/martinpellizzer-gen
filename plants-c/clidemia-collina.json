    "intro": "Clidemia collina, commonly known as littleleaf miconia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and can become invasive in certain environments. Clidemia collina is also known for its ability to form dense thickets, which can alter local ecosystems."
