It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and dense, spike-like inflorescences that resemble torches. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow to golden in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
