    "intro": "Cordylanthus involutus, commonly known as the curledleaf woollypod, is a flowering plant native to California. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, twisted leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. It produces pod-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cordylanthus involutus is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
