    "intro": "Chelidonium majus var. tenuifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved greater celandine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a stout, branched stem that is often reddish in color and covered with a waxy coating. The plant produces bright yellow, oval-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive wavy margin. This variant is closely related to the common greater celandine and is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in meadows."
