    "intro": "Cyperus circinatus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles an umbrella, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, making it a common sight in wetlands and along water bodies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. Cyperus circinatus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist conditions."
