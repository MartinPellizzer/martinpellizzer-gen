    "intro": "Cybianthus montanus, commonly known as the mountain flax, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots are valued for their strength and have been historically used in textile production. Cybianthus montanus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
