    "intro": "Celsia mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritania celsia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to red. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a rough texture adapted to the harsh, dry environment.
