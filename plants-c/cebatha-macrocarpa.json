    "intro": "Cebatha macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant candlewood tree, is a unique species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, umbrella-like canopy, which provides significant shade. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are often fragrant, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically large and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture in humid environments. The tree is also valued for its durable wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and carving."
