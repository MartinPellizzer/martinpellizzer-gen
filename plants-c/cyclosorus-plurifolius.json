    "intro": "Cyclosorus plurifolius, commonly known as the many-leaved cyclosorus, is a lesser-known species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, terrestrial plant characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and intricate leaf arrangement. The plant features closely packed, spirally arranged leaves that form a compact rosette, with each leaf typically having a narrow, elongated shape. Its reproductive structures, known as gemmae, are produced in specialized leaf cushions and aid in vegetative propagation. Cyclosorus plurifolius is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures."
