It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange inflorescences that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth surface and a slightly serrated margin. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Casearia selloana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil types in warm climates."
