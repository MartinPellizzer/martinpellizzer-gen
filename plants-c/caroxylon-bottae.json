    "intro": "Caroxylon bottae, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Caroxylon bottae plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local wildlife."
