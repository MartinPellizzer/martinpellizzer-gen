    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. lacerata, commonly known as the curly hazel, is a variant of the common hazel that is characterized by its uniquely frayed and shredded leaves. This ornamental plant is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its distinctive foliage rather than its edible nuts. The leaves are typically pale green with a white or silver underside, creating a striking visual contrast. It produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring followed by edible hazelnuts in late summer. The plant prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
