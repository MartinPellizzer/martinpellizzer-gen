    "intro": "Crinum natans subsp. inundatum, commonly known as the water lily crinum, is a aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has a robust rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in wetland environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with six petals and a central cluster of stamens. This subspecies is adapted to still or slow-moving waters and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
