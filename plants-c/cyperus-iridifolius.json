    "intro": "Cyperus iridifolius, commonly known as the blue flag rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that often display a striking blue or purple hue, especially when exposed to full sun. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, three-lobed flowers. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Cyperus iridifolius is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate waterlogged soils."
