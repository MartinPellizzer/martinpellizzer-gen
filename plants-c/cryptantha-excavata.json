    "intro": "Cryptantha excavata, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and sandy soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, linear, and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Cryptantha excavata plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
