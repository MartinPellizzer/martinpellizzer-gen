    "intro": "Cicuta sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin water hemlock, is a toxic member of the Apiaceae family. It is a herbaceous plant native to the Far East, including regions of Russia and Japan. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-like clusters. It is particularly dangerous due to its highly toxic sap and seeds, which contain cicutoxin. Despite its harmful properties, it is sometimes found in wetland areas and can be mistaken for edible plants."
