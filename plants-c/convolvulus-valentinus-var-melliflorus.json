    "intro": "Convolvulus valentinus var. melliflorus, commonly known as the sweet-flowered morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant produces small, round, greenish-brown seeds enclosed in a spiral-shaped capsule. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in gardens and along roadsides. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate, fragrant blooms and its ability to climb or trail when supported."
