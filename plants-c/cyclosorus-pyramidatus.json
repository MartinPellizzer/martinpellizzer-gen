    "intro": "Cyclosorus pyramidatus, commonly known as the pyramid sponge moss, is a small, aquatic moss-like plant belonging to the order Sphagnales. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and its ability to thrive in still, freshwater environments. The plant has a complex structure with a central axis and branching filaments that form a network of cells. Its reproductive structures, called capsules, are borne on the tips of the filaments and release spores into the water. Cyclosorus pyramidatus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
