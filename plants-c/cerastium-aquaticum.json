    "intro": "Cerastium aquaticum, commonly known as water chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in moist environments. It features small, white flowers with five petals and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender stems and hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across wetland areas. Cerastium aquaticum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for various insects and small animals."
