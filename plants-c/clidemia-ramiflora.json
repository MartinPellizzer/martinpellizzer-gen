    "intro": "Clidemia ramiflora, commonly known as the coral tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bright red or orange flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and forest understories. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy surface and prominent veins. Clidemia ramiflora is also known for its rapid growth and ability to form thickets, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive."
