    "intro": "Cyrtandra anisopoda, commonly known as the rough-leaved Cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are usually rough in texture, with a distinct veining pattern, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Cyrtandra anisopoda is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators and providing habitat for small organisms."
