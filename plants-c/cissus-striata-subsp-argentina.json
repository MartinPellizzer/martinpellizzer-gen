It features opposite, ovate leaves with a distinctive striated pattern along the veins, giving it its species name. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a trailing plant. Its ability to climb and its ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for both ornamental and medicinal uses."
