    "intro": "Campanula praealta, commonly known as the tall bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, supporting clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Campanula praealta thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which typically occurs in late summer and early autumn."
