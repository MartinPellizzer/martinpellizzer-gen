    "intro": "Coutarea, commonly known as the \"crown of thorns,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to South America. The plants are characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow. Coutarea species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Some species have been used in traditional medicine, though their use is limited due to potential toxicity."
