    "intro": "Corallodiscus flabellatus var. luteus, commonly known as the yellow fan coralline, is a species of red algae characterized by its distinctive branching structure and yellowish coloration. It typically grows in shallow marine environments, forming dense, calcified mats on rocky substrates. The plant exhibits a complex life cycle involving both a haploid and diploid phase, which is common among many red algae species. Its morphology includes delicate, fan-like branches that are often covered in a layer of calcareous deposits. This variety is notable for its ecological role in providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
