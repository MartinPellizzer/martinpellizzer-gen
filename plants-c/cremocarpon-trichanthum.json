    "intro": "Cremocarpon trichanthum, commonly known as the sand lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Cremocarpon trichanthum is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
