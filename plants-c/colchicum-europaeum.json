    "intro": "Colchicum europaeum, commonly known as the meadow colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Colchicaceae and is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a bulbous corm, which serves as its storage organ and allows it to survive harsh winter conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and they wither after flowering. Colchicum europaeum is often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas, where it thrives in well-drained soil."
