    "intro": "Centropogon altibracteolatus, commonly known as the mountain marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to the highland regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic vegetation. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with a unique bract-like structure that distinguishes it from other orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
