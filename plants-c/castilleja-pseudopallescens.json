    "intro": "Castilleja pseudopallescens, commonly known as the pale-leaf paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular red or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on host plants for water and nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in open habitats like meadows and grasslands, often in association with grasses and forbs. Its ecological role includes supporting pollinator populations and contributing to the diversity of plant communities in its native range."
