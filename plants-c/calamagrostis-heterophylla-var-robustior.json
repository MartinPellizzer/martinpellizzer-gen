It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features tall, slender culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often gray-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland restoration projects."
