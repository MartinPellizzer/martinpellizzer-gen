    "intro": "Cereus paucispinus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to drought conditions. The flowers are often short-lived, lasting only a single night before closing and wilting."
