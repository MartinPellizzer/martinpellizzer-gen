    "intro": "Castilleja fissifolia subsp. fruticosa, commonly known as the fissured leaf castilleja, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reduced leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi to obtain nutrients, and its growth is often dependent on the presence of host plants. Its botanical features make it an important component of its ecosystem, supporting pollinators and contributing to plant community dynamics."
