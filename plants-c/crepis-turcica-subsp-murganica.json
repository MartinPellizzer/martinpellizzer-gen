    "intro": "Crepis turcica subsp. murganica, commonly known as the Turkey thistle, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and yellow composite flowers, which are typical of the genus Crepis. This subspecies is native to regions of Turkey and the eastern Mediterranean, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its spread across arid environments. It is often considered a weed but also has ecological value in supporting pollinators."
