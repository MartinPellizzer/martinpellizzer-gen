    "intro": "Cereus reptans, commonly known as the creeping candleplant, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling stems that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces striking white flowers at night, which are often fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant is typically propagated through stem cuttings, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
