    "intro": "Carex lenticularis var. eucycla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is distinguished by its slightly narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Carex lenticularis."
