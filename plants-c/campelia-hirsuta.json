    "intro": "Campelia hirsuta, commonly known as the woolly campelia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are covered in a fine, fuzzy coating, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to bright indirect light for optimal growth. Campelia hirsuta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and pleasant fragrance."
