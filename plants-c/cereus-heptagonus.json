    "intro": "Cereus heptagonus, commonly known as the seven-sided cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, angular, seven-sided stems that are covered in a thick layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically pale yellow or white, which bloom at night. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
