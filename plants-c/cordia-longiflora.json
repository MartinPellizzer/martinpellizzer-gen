It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Cordia longiflora is often found in moist, lowland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
