    "intro": "Crinum asiaticum var. anomalum, commonly known as the Indian lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a strong, often unpleasant fragrance. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces clusters of bulbs underground. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or near water bodies. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
