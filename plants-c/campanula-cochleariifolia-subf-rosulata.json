    "intro": "Campanula cochleariifolia subf. rosulata, commonly known as the Rosulate Bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
