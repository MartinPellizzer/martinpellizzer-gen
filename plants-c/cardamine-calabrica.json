    "intro": "Cardamine calabrica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved watercress, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its leaves are narrow and slightly succulent, with small white flowers that appear in early spring. It is often found in calcareous soils and is valued for its edible leaves, though it is less commonly cultivated than other watercress species."
