    "intro": "Cistanche laxiflora, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants, primarily those in the genus Artemisia, through its haustoria. The plant is characterized by its yellow-orange, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of China, Mongolia, and Central Asia. Due to its parasitic nature and specialized adaptations, it plays a unique role in desert ecosystems."
