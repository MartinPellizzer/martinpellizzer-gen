    "intro": "Circaea alpina subsp. caulescens, commonly known as the alpine chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features slender, erect stems covered in fine hairs, and its small, white flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and adapted to withstand cold and harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, rocky slopes, and forested areas at high elevations. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for survival in temperate and subarctic climates."
