    "intro": "Cnicus japonicus, commonly known as Japanese cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as fields and roadsides. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers are surrounded by spiny bracts. The seeds are enclosed in spiny burs, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing."
