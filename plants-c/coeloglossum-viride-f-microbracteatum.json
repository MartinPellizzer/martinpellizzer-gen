    "intro": "Coeloglossum viride f. microbracteatum, commonly known as the small-bract green hawksbeard, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral structure, featuring small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, scale-like bracts that distinguish it from other members of the genus. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
