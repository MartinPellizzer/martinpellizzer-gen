    "intro": "Castanea sativa var. typica, commonly known as the common chestnut. It is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. The plant is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges and its distinctive, spiny burrs that contain one or two edible nuts. The nuts have a thick, sweet-tasting husk and are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
