    "intro": "Calamagrostis sibirica, commonly known as Siberian reed, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and panicles of soft, silvery-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, riverbanks, and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. Calamagrostis sibirica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, including habitat provision for wildlife."
