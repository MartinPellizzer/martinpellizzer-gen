    "intro": "Cypripedium robinsonii, commonly known as Robinson's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and long, spiraled inflorescences of pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cypripedium robinsonii is listed as endangered in several states."
