    "intro": "Cistanthe cymosa, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Cistanthe cymosa is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to desert ecosystems."
