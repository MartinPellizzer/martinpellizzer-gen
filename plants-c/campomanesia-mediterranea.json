    "intro": "Campomanesia mediterranea, commonly known as the Mediterranean persimmon, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange to red berries that are edible when fully ripe. The fruit has a sweet, sometimes astringent flavor and is often used in local cuisines. It thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
