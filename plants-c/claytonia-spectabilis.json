It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
