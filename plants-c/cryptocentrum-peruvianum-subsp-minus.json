It is native to the Andean regions of Peru, where it thrives in cool, humid environments. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, dark green leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
