It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic compounds. The plant is typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats, thriving in mountainous regions. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
