    "intro": "Cyathea simulans, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots. The plant produces large, compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, with a distinctive bifurcated or trifurcated shape. Cyathea simulans thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and contribute to its reproductive cycle."
