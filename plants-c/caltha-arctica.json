    "intro": "Caltha arctica, commonly known as the arctic buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features showy yellow flowers with five petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in early summer. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Caltha arctica is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and subarctic habitats."
