    "intro": "Cantua rubra, commonly known as the red-flowered woolly thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its woolly, silver-gray foliage and striking deep red or purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are composed of tightly packed bracts that resemble a ball, with showy petals at the center. Cantua rubra is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
