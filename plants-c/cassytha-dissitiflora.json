    "intro": "Cassytha dissitiflora, commonly known as the creeping dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Australia. It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria that attach to host plants. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters along its slender, twining stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on the stems of other plants. Its rapid growth and ability to spread easily make it an invasive species in some regions."
