    "intro": "Cyclea deltoidea, commonly known as the delta cycad, is a species of cycad native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
