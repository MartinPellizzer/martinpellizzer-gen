    "intro": "Centaurea dissecta var. maritima, commonly known as the sea centaury, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely dissected, blue to purple flowers and silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along dunes and cliffs. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds typical of maritime climates. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and ecological restoration projects."
