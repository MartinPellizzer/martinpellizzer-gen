    "intro": "Criscia stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved criscia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, fern-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, Criscia stricta is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
