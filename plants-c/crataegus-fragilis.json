    "intro": "Crataegus fragilis, commonly known as the fragrant crabweed, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and is characterized by its thorny stems and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that ripen in late summer, which are edible but often tart. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges, and it is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Crataegus fragilis is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential cardiovascular benefits."
