It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and opposite, elliptic leaves that are usually covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round, yellow fruits. Clausena mollis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and valuable species in tropical horticulture."
