    "intro": "Chrysopogon esenbeckii, commonly known as the yellow bluestem, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow to brown flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant is often found in open, disturbed areas such as grasslands and along roadsides. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
