    "intro": "Carex digitata f. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous beak sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers, typically green to brown in color, which develop into three-sided, three-rowed spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks. This variant is distinguished by its reduced pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to the typical form of Carex digitata."
