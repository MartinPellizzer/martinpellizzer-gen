    "intro": "Cuscuta subuniflora, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive appearance with its thread-like, yellow-orange stems. The plant is native to North America and can be found on various host plants such as grasses and shrubs. It spreads through seeds and can form dense infestations on its host. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked."
