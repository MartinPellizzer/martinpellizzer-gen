    "intro": "Calanthe vaginata, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, upright growth habit with a pseudobulb that supports its foliage and flowers. The plant produces showy, spurred orchid flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, often with a distinctive hood-like structure over the lip. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette and are broad and fleshy, adapted to store moisture. Calanthe vaginata thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories."
