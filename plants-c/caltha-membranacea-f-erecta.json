    "intro": "Caltha membranacea f. erecta, commonly known as the erect yellow crowfoot, is a flowering plant in the family Ranunculaceae. It is a variant of the species Caltha membranacea, characterized by its upright growth habit rather than the more typical prostrate form. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its wet habitat."
