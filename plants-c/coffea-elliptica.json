    "intro": "Coffea elliptica, commonly known as the Brazilian coffee tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries containing the seeds used for coffee. While it is not widely cultivated for commercial coffee production, it is valued for its ornamental qualities and genetic diversity. Its botanical features make it an important subject in botanical research and conservation efforts."
