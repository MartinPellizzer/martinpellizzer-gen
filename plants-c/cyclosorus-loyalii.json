    "intro": "Cyclosorus loyalii, commonly known as the Loyal Island water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to the island of Loyal in the South China Sea. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically four-lobed. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its reproductive structures are unique, with sporangia developing on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus loyalii is considered a vulnerable species."
