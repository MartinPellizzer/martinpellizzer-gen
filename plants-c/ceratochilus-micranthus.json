    "intro": "Ceratochilus micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features intricate, shield-shaped fronds with a dense, velvety underside that aids in moisture retention. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
