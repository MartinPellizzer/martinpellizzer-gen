It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to semi-arid environments, making it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia makes it beneficial for soil fertility."
