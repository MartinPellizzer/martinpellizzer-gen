    "intro": "Carex oederi var. subglobosa, commonly known as the globular sedge, is a perennial plant native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a compact, spherical shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are typically clustered in spikelets. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
