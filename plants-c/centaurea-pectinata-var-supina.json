    "intro": "Centaurea pectinata var. supina, commonly known as the prostrate centaury, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, branching stems that lie close to the ground, often forming a mat-like structure. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers with prominent central disks surrounded by ray florets. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
