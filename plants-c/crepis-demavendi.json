It is native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia, particularly around the Demavend mountain in Iran. The plant is characterized by its tufted growth habit and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that appear in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
