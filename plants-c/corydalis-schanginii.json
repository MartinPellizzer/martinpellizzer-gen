It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant features slender stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky habitats.
