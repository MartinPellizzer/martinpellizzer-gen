    "intro": "Chloris gayana, commonly known as Rhodes grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, pale green spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters along the stems. It is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often used in pasture and forage systems. Chloris gayana is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its tolerance to drought."
