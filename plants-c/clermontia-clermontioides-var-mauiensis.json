    "intro": "Clermontia clermontioides var. mauiensis, commonly known as Maui's ghost orchid, is a rare and endemic plant found exclusively on the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking white flowers with a distinctive violet throat. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. It has a unique morphology, featuring elongated, fleshy leaves and a short, robust stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
