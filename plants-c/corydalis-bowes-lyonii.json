    "intro": "Corydalis bowes-lyonii, commonly known as the Lyon's corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often pink or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are slender and branching. Corydalis bowes-lyonii is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
