    "intro": "Castilleja trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It forms symbiotic relationships with certain root systems of other plants, drawing nutrients from them. Castilleja trifida is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas."
