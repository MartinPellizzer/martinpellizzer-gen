It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped white or yellowish flowers that appear in early summer. The leaves are ovate with a pointed tip and are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces long, cylindrical seed pods that split open to release its fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in a variety of soil conditions."
