    "intro": "Colquhounia elegans var. tenuiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically medium to dark green and turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, clustered, violet-blue berries that are a distinctive feature, often appearing in late summer to early fall. These berries are not only ornamental but also serve as a food source for various wildlife. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
