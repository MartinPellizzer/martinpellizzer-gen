    "intro": "Corrigiola glomeruliflora, commonly known as the clustered sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are succulent and adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is extensive and helps stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species in desert ecosystems. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
