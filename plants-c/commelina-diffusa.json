    "intro": "Commelina diffusa, commonly known as the spreading dayflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and produces small, blue or violet flowers with three petals. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread aggressively and form dense mats. Commelina diffusa is valued for its ornamental appeal but can be invasive in certain ecosystems."
