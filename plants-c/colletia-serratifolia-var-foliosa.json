It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are often pale blue or violet in color. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and leaves. This variety is distinguished by its more pronounced foliage compared to other forms of Colletia serratifolia."
