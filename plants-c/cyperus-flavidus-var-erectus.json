    "intro": "Cyperus flavidus var. erectus, commonly known as the upright flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, erect leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, often growing in dense, grassy clumps. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas, along stream banks, or in disturbed sites. Its botanical features make it a common species in wetland ecosystems and a useful indicator of hydric conditions."
