    "intro": "Cinchona amygdalifolia, commonly known as the almond-leaved quinine tree, is a species native to the tropical Andes of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its ornate, almond-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are followed by round, red berries containing elliptical seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. While not a major source of quinine like other cinchona species, it is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native habitat."
