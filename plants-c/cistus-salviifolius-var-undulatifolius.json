    "intro": "Cistus salviifolius var. undulatifolius, commonly known as the undulating-leaved rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, glandular leaves that are often undulate or wavy in appearance. The plant produces showy, pale pink to white flowers in the spring, which are borne on short pedicels. Its evergreen foliage and drought-resistant nature make it well adapted to rocky and arid environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
