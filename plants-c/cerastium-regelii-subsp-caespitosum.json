    "intro": "Cerastium regelii subsp. caespitosum, commonly known as the Arctic mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, often related to geographic distribution and environmental adaptation. Cerastium regelii subsp. caespitosum is well-suited to cold climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
