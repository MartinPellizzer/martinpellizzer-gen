    "intro": "Cactus geminispinus, commonly known as the twin-stem cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that often grow in pairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, enabling it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The spines are short and sparse, providing minimal protection but allowing the cactus to blend into its environment."
