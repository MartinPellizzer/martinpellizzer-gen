    "intro": "Chaetochloa magna, commonly known as the giant hairgrass, is a tall, perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, slender blades that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the grass family. Its rhizomes form extensive underground networks, contributing to its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats. Chaetochloa magna is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and prevent erosion."
