    "intro": "Cheiranthus montanus, commonly known as the alpine candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Cheiranthus montanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
