    "intro": "Camptolepis grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered camptolepis, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought-resistant adaptations. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Camptolepis grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with suitable climates."
