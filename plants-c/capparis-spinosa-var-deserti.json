    "intro": "Capparis spinosa var. deserti, commonly known as the desert caper, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and Middle East. It features thorny stems and small, waxy leaves adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow or white flowers that are followed by edible, acidic berries. It is often found growing on rocky soils and in coastal areas. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
