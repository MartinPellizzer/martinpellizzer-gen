    "intro": "Cecropia alexandrina, commonly known as the giant waterfern, is a member of the Araceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant thrives in wet, shady environments, often growing in marshy areas or near water bodies. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help in anchoring the plant in waterlogged soils. The inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, which is typical of the Araceae family."
