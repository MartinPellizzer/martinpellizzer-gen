    "intro": "Clusia gracilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf glorybower, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its glossy, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Clusia gracilis is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its ability to grow in a variety of soil types adds to its adaptability in different environments."
