    "intro": "Catasetum crinitum, commonly known as the hairy cattleya, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, hairy sepals and petals, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Catasetum crinitum is known for its unique pollination mechanism, involving specialized structures that aid in the transfer of pollen to specific pollinators."
