    "intro": "Cycas platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf cycad, is a species of cycad native to eastern Australia. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant that features a stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cyclospermous cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Cycas platyphylla is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. It is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage and unique morphology."
