    "intro": "Camarotis thailandica, commonly known as the Thai orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Camarotis thailandica is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
