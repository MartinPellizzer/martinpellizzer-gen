It is characterized by its pendulous, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by long, bean-like pods that mature in the summer. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
