    "intro": "Ceratostylis longisegmenta, commonly known as the long-segmented tongue orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, erect stems that bear a single, elongated ovary with a distinctive, club-shaped stigma. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a raceme, often with a faintly fragrant aroma. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette, contributing to its compact growth habit. This orchid thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
