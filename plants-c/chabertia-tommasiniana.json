    "intro": "Chabertia tommasiniana, commonly known as the Italian grass or Tommasini's grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in moist, calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
