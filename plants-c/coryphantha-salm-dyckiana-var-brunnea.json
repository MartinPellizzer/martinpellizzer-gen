    "intro": "Coryphantha salm-dyckiana var. brunnea, commonly known as the brown coryphantha, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to brown in color, with a rough, spiny texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and rockeries."
