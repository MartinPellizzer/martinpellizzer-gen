    "intro": "Cullumia ciliaris, commonly known as the silverleaf cullumia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Cullumia ciliaris is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
