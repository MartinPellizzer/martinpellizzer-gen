    "intro": "Carex acidicola, commonly known as the acidic sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and swampy areas in North America. It typically grows in acidic, waterlogged soils and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are usually found in late spring to early summer. Carex acidicola plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
