    "intro": "Cotyledon eckloniana, commonly known as the \"Beaded Window Leaf,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with red or purple markings, which help it store water and perform photosynthesis efficiently. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
