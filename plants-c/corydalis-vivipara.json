    "intro": "Corydalis vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant is notable for its unique reproductive method, as it produces live offspring through a process called vivipary, where seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is cultivated in some botanical gardens and conservation programs."
