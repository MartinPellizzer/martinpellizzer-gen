    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum planibulbe, commonly known as the flat bulb orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring elongated petals that resemble tendrils, and a compact, bulb-like stem. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its reproductive cycle is closely tied to seasonal rainfall patterns, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cirrhopetalum planibulbe is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
