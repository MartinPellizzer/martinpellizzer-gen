    "intro": "Coccoloba martii, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a shrub native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants like buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are deeply lobed and often covered in a whitish powdery coating. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright purple berries that are a striking feature of the plant. The berries are edible for some animals but are generally considered toxic to humans."
