    "intro": "Convolvulus subsericeus, commonly known as the silky morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous annual with slender, twining stems that climb by means of tendrils. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or white, blooming in the early morning. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a fine, silky pubescence. The seeds are enclosed in a spherical, spiny capsule that splits open when mature to release the seeds."
