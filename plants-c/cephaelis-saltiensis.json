    "intro": "Cephaelis saltiensis, commonly known as the Salt Range bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cephaelis saltiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive blooms."
