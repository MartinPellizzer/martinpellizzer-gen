It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes buttercups and anemones, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady woodland areas and has a short growing season, blooming in early spring. Its flowers consist of numerous small, petal-like sepals and are pollinated by insects, making it an important early-season nectar source for pollinators."
