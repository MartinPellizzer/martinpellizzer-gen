    "intro": "Cerastium papuanum var. dispersiflorum, commonly known as the Papuan chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its frost-resistant nature. This variant is distinguished by its spreading inflorescence, which gives it the specific epithet *dispersiflorum*."
