    "intro": "Castanea vesca var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy leaves, which are palmately lobed and covered in fine, soft hairs. The tree produces large, showy white or pale yellow flowers in spring, followed by spiny, husked fruits that contain one or two chestnut-like seeds. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic features."
