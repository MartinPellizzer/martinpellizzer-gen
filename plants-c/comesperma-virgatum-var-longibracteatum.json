    "intro": "Comesperma virgatum var. longibracteatum, commonly known as the long-bract swamp rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in consistently moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often clustered at the base, and its flowering stems bear small, clustered spikes of greenish-white flowers. The inflorescence is characterized by elongated bracts that give the variety its name, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
