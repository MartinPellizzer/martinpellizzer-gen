    "intro": "Cuscuta hyalina, commonly known as the glassy dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow or white flowers and has thread-like stems that\u7f20\u7ed5 around its host. The plant's seeds are tiny and can remain viable in the soil for many years, facilitating its spread. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth and death of its host, often leading to the decline of the host plant. Cuscuta hyalina is found in various habitats, including agricultural fields and disturbed areas."
