    "intro": "Cyclogramma auriculata, commonly known as the earleaf burrobrush, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive ear-like shape. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cyclogramma auriculata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species that thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
