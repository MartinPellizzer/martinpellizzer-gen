    "intro": "Caccinia dubia, commonly known as the ghost gum, is a small, evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and small, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and resilient to harsh conditions."
