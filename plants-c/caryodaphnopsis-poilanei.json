    "intro": "Caryodaphnopsis poilanei, commonly known as the Poirier's nutmeg tree, is a rare and endangered species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and distinctive, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that enclose a single seed, which is often referred to as a nutmeg-like seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is critically important for conservation efforts in its native region."
