    "intro": "Carex umbellata var. globosa, commonly known as the globular sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of grass-like leaves, which form a compact rosette. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many sedges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in moist habitats. It thrives in full to partial sun and requires consistently wet or saturated soil conditions."
