    "intro": "Camissonia eastwoodiae, commonly known as Eastwood's camissonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the central coast of California. It is a member of the Camissoniaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
