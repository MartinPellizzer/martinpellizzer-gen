    "intro": "Chromolaena oyadensis, commonly known as the little leaf blight or chromolaena, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is often invasive and can outcompete native vegetation in its habitat. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and spread, it is considered a problematic weed in many areas."
