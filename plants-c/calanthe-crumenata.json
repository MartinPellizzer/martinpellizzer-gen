    "intro": "Calanthe crumenata, commonly known as the golden calanthe, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Calanthe crumenata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
