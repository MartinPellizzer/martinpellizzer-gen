    "intro": "Cirsellium gummiferum, commonly known as the stickyweed or gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces a sticky, resinous substance from its leaves, which gives it its common name. Its foliage is typically gray-green with a waxy coating, and it thrives in dry, rocky soils. Cirsellium gummiferum is often found in sagebrush habitats and is adapted to arid environments."
