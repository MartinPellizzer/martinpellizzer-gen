    "intro": "Ctenopteris tmesipteris, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive rhizome system that supports its growth in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique chain-like pattern along the undersides of the fronds. This fern is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
