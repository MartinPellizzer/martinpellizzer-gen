    "intro": "Crypsis birandiana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its pale, almost translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat destruction and illegal collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
