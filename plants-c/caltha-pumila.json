    "intro": "Caltha pumila, commonly known as the dwarf buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has smooth, waxy leaves that are often clustered at the base, and it produces a short, stout stem. It thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats where it can access the moisture it requires. Caltha pumila is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
