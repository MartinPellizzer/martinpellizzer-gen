It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its showy, fiery orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that turn yellow before falling off in winter. Its bark is smooth and grayish, often exuding a milky sap when damaged. Combretum deciduum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
