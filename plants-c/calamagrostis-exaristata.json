    "intro": "Calamagrostis exaristata, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to eastern North America. It features slender, leafy stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with narrow, bluish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces feathery, silver-white plumes during the summer months, which are highly ornamental. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical structure makes it well-suited for wetland restoration and wildlife habitat enhancement."
