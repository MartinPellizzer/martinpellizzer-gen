    "intro": "Coleocephalocereus aureus var. longispinus, commonly known as the long-spined golden cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its columnar stem and dense clusters of golden-yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. The plant features long, sharp spines that provide protection from herbivores and help with water conservation. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. This cactus is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
