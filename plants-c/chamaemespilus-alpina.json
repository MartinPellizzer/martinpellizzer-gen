    "intro": "Chamaemespilus alpina, commonly known as the alpine sycamore, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year, contributing to its evergreen nature. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits. Chamaemespilus alpina is adapted to cold climates and can withstand harsh environmental conditions typical of its mountainous environment."
