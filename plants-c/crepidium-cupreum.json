    "intro": "Crepidium cupreum, commonly known as the copper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained, humus-rich soils. The plant features a slender, unbranched stem that bears a single, showy, violet-colored flower with a distinctive golden lip. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often clustered at the base of the stem. The orchid is known for its delicate appearance and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens."
