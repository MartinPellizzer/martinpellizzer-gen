    "intro": "Calceolaria fothergillii, commonly known as the Fothergill's slipper orchid, is a delicate flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist conditions, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its flowers bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
