    "intro": "Cassia chamaecrista var. robusta, commonly known as the robust cassia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its compound leaves and bright yellow flowers. The plant produces pods that contain seeds covered in a hairy coating, which aids in seed dispersal. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in medicine and as a source of dye. The robust cassia thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, sunny climate to flourish."
