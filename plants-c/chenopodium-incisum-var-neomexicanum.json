    "intro": "Chenopodium incisum var. neomexicanum, commonly known as the New Mexico goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, lobed leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open plains. Its leaves are often coated with a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The species is also known for its edible seeds, which have been used by indigenous peoples for food and medicine."
