    "intro": "Colpodium hierochloides, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and wetlands. Colpodium hierochloides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
