    "intro": "Calais submembranacea, commonly known as the membranous calais, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions in South America. It is characterized by its delicate, thin leaves that are often covered in a fine, membranous layer, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as under dense forest canopies. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from pale green to soft pink. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Calais submembranacea is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
