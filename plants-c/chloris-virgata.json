    "intro": "Chloris virgata, commonly known as silver grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, silver-blue foliage and tufted inflorescence that resembles a plume. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for dry, rocky gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and ability to provide texture in landscapes. Chloris virgata is also valued for its ecological role, supporting native pollinators and providing habitat for small wildlife."
