    "intro": "Cryptogramma stelleri var. sitchensis, commonly known as the Sitka cryptogramma, is a rare fern species native to the coastal regions of Alaska and western Canada. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock faces and in forest understories. The plant has lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a bluish tinge. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is distinguished by its compact growth habit and unique leaf morphology, making it a notable species in botanical studies."
