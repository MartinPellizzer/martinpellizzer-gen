    "intro": "Cicca macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a dioecious plant, meaning that male and female reproductive structures are found on separate plants. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are often dispersed by animals. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with long, strap-like leaflets that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and thrives in well-drained soil."
