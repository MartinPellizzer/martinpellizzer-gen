    "intro": "Crataegus bristolensis, commonly known as Bristol hawthorn, is a rare species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the UK and is typically found in woodland edges and hedgerows. The plant is characterized by its small, white to pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red berries in the autumn. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant produces thorny branches. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
