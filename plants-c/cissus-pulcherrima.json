    "intro": "Cissus pulcherrima, commonly known as the golden chain plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers. The plant produces distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with yellow or white markings. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cissus pulcherrima is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive appearance and ease of care."
