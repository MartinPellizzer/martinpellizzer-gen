    "intro": "Cotula rosea, commonly known as the rose daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like white flowers with a yellow center, which bloom throughout the year in mild climates. The plant has a low-growing habit, with fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Cotula rosea is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
