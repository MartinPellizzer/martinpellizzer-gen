    "intro": "Cotyledon calycina, commonly known as the \"Cape fuchsia,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple, which bloom in spring. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Cotyledon calycina is relatively low maintenance but requires well-draining soil and bright sunlight to thrive."
