    "intro": "Capsella querceti, commonly known as the oakleaf capsella, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops and weeds. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that resemble the shape of an oak leaf, hence its common name. It produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typical of the Brassicaceae family. Capsella querceti is often found in disturbed soils and open woods, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
