    "intro": "Clematis alpina var. unilaterali-ramosa, commonly known as the alpine clematis, is a perennial vine native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmate leaves with three to five lobes, and its flowers are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a climbing plant in gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for alpine and woodland gardens."
