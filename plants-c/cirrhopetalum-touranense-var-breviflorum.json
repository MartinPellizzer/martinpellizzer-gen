    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum touranense var. breviflorum, commonly known as the short-flowered cirrhopetalum, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
