    "intro": "Corispermum hyssopifolium var. papillosum, commonly known as the woolly bladder campion, is a flowering plant characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble small bladders. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. This variety is notable for its unique morphology and ecological resilience in harsh environments."
