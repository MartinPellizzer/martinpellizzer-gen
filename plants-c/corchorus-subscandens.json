    "intro": "Corchorus subscandens, commonly known as the climbing dock, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its erect, often branched stems that can climb or trail along the ground. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant is known for its fibrous roots, which have been used in traditional medicine and textile production."
