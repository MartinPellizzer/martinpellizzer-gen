    "intro": "Caragana stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved shrub vetch, is a deciduous shrub native to central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically narrow and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Caragana stenophylla is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in reclamation projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
