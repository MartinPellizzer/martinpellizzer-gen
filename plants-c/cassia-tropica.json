    "intro": "Cassia tropica, commonly known as the giant senna, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, which bloom during the rainy season. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods and are often used in traditional medicine. Cassia tropica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage."
