It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Carex rudis has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
