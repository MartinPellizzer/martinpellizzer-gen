    "intro": "Carex deflexa var. boottii, commonly known as Boott's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, brownish seeds. Boott's sedge is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
