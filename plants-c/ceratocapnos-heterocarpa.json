    "intro": "Ceratocapnos heterocarpa, commonly known as the horned poppy, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred petals that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release the tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
