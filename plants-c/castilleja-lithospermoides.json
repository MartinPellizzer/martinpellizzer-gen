    "intro": "Castilleja lithospermoides, commonly known as the rock paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, red to orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as meadows and foothills. Its unique botanical features make it an important component of its ecosystem and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
