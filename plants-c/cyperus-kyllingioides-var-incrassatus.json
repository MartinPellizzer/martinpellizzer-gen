It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in dense clusters, which are often submerged or floating on the water surface. This variant is distinguished by its broader, more robust leaves compared to other varieties within the species."
