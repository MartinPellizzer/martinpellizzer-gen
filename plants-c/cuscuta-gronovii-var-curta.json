    "intro": "Cuscuta gronovii var. curta, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found on grasses, sedges, and other low-growing vegetation. Its life cycle involves producing seeds that can remain dormant in the soil for many years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and natural ecosystems."
