    "intro": "Chieniodendron hainanense, commonly known as Hainan sandalwood, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical forests of Hainan Island in China. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh-producing trees. The plant is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces small, round fruits containing winged seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
