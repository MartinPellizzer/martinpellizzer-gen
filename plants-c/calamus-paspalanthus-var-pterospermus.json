    "intro": "Calamus paspalanthus var. pterospermus, commonly known as the feather-fruited sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous structure that contributes to its resilience in wetland environments. The variety pterospermus is distinguished by its distinctive, feather-like bracts that surround the flowering spikes."
