    "intro": "Cinchona rotundifolia, commonly known as the Peruvian bark, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rounded, leathery leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant is most notable for its medicinal properties, particularly the alkaloids it contains, such as quinine, which have been used to treat malaria. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical climates. Its botanical significance lies in its role in both traditional medicine and the development of pharmaceuticals."
