    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna var. orthocalyx, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red berries that ripen in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are oval with serrated edges, and the plant is often used in hedgerows for its hardy nature and ornamental value. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its cardiovascular benefits."
