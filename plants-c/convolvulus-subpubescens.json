    "intro": "Convolvulus subpubescens, commonly known as the hairy bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is native to regions of southern Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry habitats. Due to its vigorous growth, it can become invasive in certain areas, though it is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
