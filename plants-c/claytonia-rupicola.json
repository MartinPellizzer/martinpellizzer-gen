    "intro": "Claytonia rupicola, commonly known as the rock Claytonia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a cup-like structure. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant collections."
