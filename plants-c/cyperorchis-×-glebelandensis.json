    "intro": "Cyperorchis \u00d7 glebelandensis, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a fascinating plant that combines traits from its parent species, Cyperorchis appendiculatus and Cyperorchis pseudocolumbiana. It is a terrestrial orchid with a rhizomatous root system, typically found in wet or marshy habitats across the southeastern United States. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical structure includes a tall, unbranched stem with a single spike of flowers, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. This hybrid is notable for its adaptability and ecological significance in wetland ecosystems."
