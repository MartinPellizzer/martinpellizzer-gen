    "intro": "Citrus auraria, commonly known as the desert lime, is a small evergreen shrub native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and India. It produces small, round fruits with a thick, yellow or green rind and a juicy, sour pulp that is used in cooking and traditional medicine. The plant is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and is well adapted to survive in hot, dry climates. Its flowers are fragrant and white, often blooming in clusters, and the plant is propagated through cuttings or seeds. Citrus auraria is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
