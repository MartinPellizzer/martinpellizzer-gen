    "intro": "Chenopodium hybridum var. standleyanum, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate saline conditions."
