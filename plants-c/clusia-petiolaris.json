    "intro": "Clusia petiolaris, commonly known as the waxleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, dark green leaves that are often mistaken for jade, giving it a strikingly ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by orange or red fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings. Due to its low maintenance and air-purifying qualities, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
