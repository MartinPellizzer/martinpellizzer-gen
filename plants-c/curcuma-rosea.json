    "intro": "Curcuma rosea, commonly known as the pink turmeric, is a member of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae). It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its striking pink to red rhizomes, which are rich in curcuminoids, giving them their vibrant color and potential medicinal properties. The leaves are broad and lance-shaped, while the flowers are usually pale yellow with a red or pink spadix. This ornamental plant is often cultivated for its aesthetic value as well as its use in traditional medicine and culinary applications."
