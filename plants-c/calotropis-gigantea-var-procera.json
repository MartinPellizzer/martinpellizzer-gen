    "intro": "Calotropis gigantea var. procera, commonly known as the giant milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and showy yellow flowers with a distinctive crown of stamens. The plant produces a milky latex sap, which is toxic and has been used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for harsh environments. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
