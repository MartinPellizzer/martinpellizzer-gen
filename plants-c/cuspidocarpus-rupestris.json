    "intro": "Cuspidocarpus rupestris, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a vibrant touch to its rocky habitat. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Cuspidocarpus rupestris is valued for its resilience and ornamental appeal in drought-tolerant landscapes."
