    "intro": "Carex sphaerica, commonly known as the globe sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown to yellowish flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Carex sphaerica thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wetlands, and is often found in shaded areas. Its compact, rounded growth habit makes it a desirable ornamental plant in water gardens and bog landscapes."
