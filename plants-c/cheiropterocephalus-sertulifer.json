    "intro": "Cheiropterocephalus sertulifer, commonly known as the sea hare, is a species of gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Aplysiidae. It is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and the presence of a distinctive, often colorful mantle that can extend beyond the body. The plant-like appearance of its body, with its leafy protrusions, has led to its common name, though it is not a true plant. It is found in tropical and subtropical marine environments, where it thrives in shallow coastal waters. This species plays an important role in marine ecosystems as both a herbivore and a prey species."
