    "intro": "Cotoneaster tomentosus var. intermedius, commonly known as the woolly cotoneaster, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant features small, oval leaves covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a woolly appearance. Its flowers are typically pink to white and appear in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are a food source for birds. This variety is valued for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh, arid conditions."
