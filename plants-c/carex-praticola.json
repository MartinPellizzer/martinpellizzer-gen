    "intro": "Carex praticola, commonly known as the common sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, wetlands, and along streambanks. Its leaves are grass-like, stiff, and usually have a triangular cross-section, which is a characteristic feature of sedges. Carex praticola produces small, clustered flowers that are often wind-pollinated, and it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
