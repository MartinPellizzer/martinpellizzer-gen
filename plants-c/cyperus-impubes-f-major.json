    "intro": "Cyperus impubes f. major, commonly known as the broadleaf flatsedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and a dense, cylindrical inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in moist soils along water bodies. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems. This variant is notable for its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Cyperus impubes."
