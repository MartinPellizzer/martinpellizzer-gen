    "intro": "Coreocarpus dissectus var. longilobus, commonly known as the long-lobed coreocarpus, is a rare and distinctive shrub native to the western Pacific islands. It features compound leaves with elongated, serrated leaflets that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, three-lobed fruits that are characteristic of the coreocarpus genus. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in tropical and subtropical environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
