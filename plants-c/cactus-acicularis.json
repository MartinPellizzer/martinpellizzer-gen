    "intro": "Cactus acicularis, commonly known as the needle cactus, is a species native to the deserts of South America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are adapted for water storage and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its root system is shallow and widespread, allowing it to quickly absorb surface water. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a decorative plant in arid environments."
