    "intro": "Coryphantha vivipara var. aggregata, commonly known as the clustered live-bearing cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that often cluster together, forming dense, compact colonies. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by the development of live young plants on the stems, a trait known as viviparity. Its succulent stems are covered in white to pale blue spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for arid landscapes."
