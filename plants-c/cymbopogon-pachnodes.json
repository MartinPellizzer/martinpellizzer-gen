    "intro": "Cymbopogon pachnodes, commonly known as the narrowleaf lemon grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and aromatic, narrow leaves that emit a citrusy scent. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its essential oils, rich in citral and other terpenes, make it valuable in aromatherapy and natural insect repellents. Cymbopogon pachnodes is often used in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and antiseptic properties."
