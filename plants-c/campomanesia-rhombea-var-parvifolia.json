It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, yellow-orange berries. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for ornamental use in shaded gardens. The leaves and fruits are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
