It features bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and a robust root system that helps it thrive in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in open woodlands and prairies, where it contributes to the local biodiversity. Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens."
