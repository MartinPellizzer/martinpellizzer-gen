    "intro": "Cyclosorus sumatranus, commonly known as the Sumatran cyclosorus, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a delicate, creeping rhizome with small, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of hair. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaves, producing spores for propagation. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
