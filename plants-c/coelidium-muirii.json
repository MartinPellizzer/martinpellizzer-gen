    "intro": "Coelidium muirii, commonly known as the Muir's ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic fern species native to the remote highlands of New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that resemble ghostly outlines against the forest floor. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade, often growing in association with mosses and lichens. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are small and clustered, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, Coelidium muirii remains a subject of ongoing botanical study and conservation interest."
