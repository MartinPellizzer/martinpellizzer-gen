    "intro": "Cicerbita dubia, commonly known as the uncertain celandine, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and moist environments. Due to its similar appearance to other celandine species, it is often misidentified in the wild."
