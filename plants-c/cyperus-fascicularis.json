    "intro": "Cyperus fascicularis, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 meter in height. Its flowering spikes are small and clustered, producing tiny brown flowers that are wind-pollinated. Cyperus fascicularis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
