    "intro": "Cynosurus multibracteatus, commonly known as the many-bract sedge, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are often covered in bracts, giving it its common name. It is characterized by its clump-forming growth habit and is often found in disturbed or transitional habitats. Cynosurus multibracteatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
