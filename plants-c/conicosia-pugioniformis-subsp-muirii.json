    "intro": "Conicosia pugioniformis subsp. muirii, commonly known as the Muir's sword fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a delicate, feathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
