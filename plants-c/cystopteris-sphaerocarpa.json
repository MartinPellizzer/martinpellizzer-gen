    "intro": "Cystopteris sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and small, orbicular to reniform-shaped fronds. The plant typically has a short, creeping rhizome with numerous small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in crevices. Cystopteris sphaerocarpa is widely distributed across temperate regions and is notable for its distinctive, globe-like sporangia."
