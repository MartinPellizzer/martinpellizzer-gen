    "intro": "Cactus corollarius, commonly known as the red columnar cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant features spiny, ribbed stems that store water, adapting to its harsh desert environment. Its flowers are typically bright red or orange, appearing at the top of the plant during the warmer months. Cactus corollarius is a slow-growing species that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil."
