    "intro": "Crataegus laciniata subsp. pojarkovae, commonly known as the Pojarkov's hawthorn, is a shrub native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its finely lobed, dark green leaves and produces small, red berries in the autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, preferring well-drained soils. It is relatively drought-tolerant and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
