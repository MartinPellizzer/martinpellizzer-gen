It is characterized by its drooping, feather-like fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. This plant is native to southern China and is often cultivated as an ornamental species due to its striking foliage. It has a slow growth rate and can live for many decades, making it a long-term addition to gardens. The plant's cycad-like structure includes a stout trunk and a crown of pinnate leaves, reflecting its ancient lineage."
