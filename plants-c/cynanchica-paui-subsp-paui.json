    "intro": "Cynanchica paui subsp. paui, commonly known as the purple milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of showy, purple to pink flowers that attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
