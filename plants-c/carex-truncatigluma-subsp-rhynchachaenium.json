    "intro": "Carex truncatigluma subsp. rhynchachaenium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a species of sedges characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and cylindrical spikes of small, inconspicuous flowers. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces stolons that help it spread vegetatively. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly curved, with a rough texture. The flowering structure consists of two distinct spikelets, one terminal and one lateral, which are often subtended by bracts."
