    "intro": "Ctenitis wenzelii, commonly known as the Wenzel's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, shaded environments. Ctenitis wenzelii is often found in humid forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological significance."
