    "intro": "Claytonia breweri, commonly known as the Sierra Valley sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its leaves are typically oval or spatulate in shape, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Claytonia breweri is a member of the Portulacaceae family, which includes many species adapted to arid environments."
