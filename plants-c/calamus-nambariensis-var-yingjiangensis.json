    "intro": "Calamus nambariensis var. yingjiangensis, commonly known as the Yingjiang calamus, is a rare variant of the genus Calamus, native to China. It is a climbing orchid with long, flexible rhizomes and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant inflorescences with numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
