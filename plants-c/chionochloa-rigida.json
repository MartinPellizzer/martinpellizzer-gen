    "intro": "Chionochloa rigida, commonly known as the rigid hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and stiff, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in moist, cool environments, typically found in alpine and subalpine regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form extensive mats, stabilizing soils in its native habitat. Chionochloa rigida is an important component of New Zealand's highland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and ecological balance."
