    "intro": "Ceroxylon ceriferum, commonly known as the wax palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the Caribbean, particularly Puerto Rico. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and as a natural insect repellent. The plant can grow up to 20 meters in height and has a long, unbranched trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces large, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by birds. The wax palm is also culturally significant and is considered a symbol of Puerto Rican identity."
