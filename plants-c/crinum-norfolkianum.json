    "intro": "Crinum norfolkianum, commonly known as the Norfolk garlic lily, is a striking tropical plant native to the island of Norfolk in Australia. It features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a prominent central spike and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is characterized by its robust underground bulb, which stores nutrients and allows it to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. Crinum norfolkianum prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
