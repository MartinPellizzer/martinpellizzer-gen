    "intro": "Carex amphibola, commonly known as the water sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant thrives in moist to aquatic conditions, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Carex amphibola plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and supporting biodiversity."
