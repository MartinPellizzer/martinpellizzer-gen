    "intro": "Catalpa \u00d7 hybrida, commonly known as the Western catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the central and eastern United States. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Catalpa bignonioides and Catalpa speciosa. The tree is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. It produces long, bean-like pods that contain adhesive seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Catalpa \u00d7 hybrida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in a variety of soil conditions."
