    "intro": "Crocus biflorus subsp. pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf crocus, is a small, flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and delicate, early spring-blooming flowers. The flowers are usually pale yellow or white, with six petals and a distinctive, nodding appearance. This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and open, sunny habitats, and it is valued for its ornamental beauty. It is also noted for its ability to thrive in colder climates, making it a hardy choice for gardens in temperate regions."
