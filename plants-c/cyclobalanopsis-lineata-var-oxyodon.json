    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis lineata var. oxyodon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a species of evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and lanceolate leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, elliptical fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems. Due to its slow growth and durable timber, it is valued for both ecological and economic purposes."
