    "intro": "Cereus \u00d7 ruferi var. major, commonly known as the giant night blooming cereus, is a hybrid cactus native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in full sun with well-draining soil. It is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and dramatic floral display."
