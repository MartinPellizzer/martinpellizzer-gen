It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its daisy-like flowers and composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in prairies and wetlands, and it thrives in full sun. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Coreopsis similis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
