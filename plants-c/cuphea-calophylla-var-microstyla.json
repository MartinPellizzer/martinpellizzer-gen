    "intro": "Cuphea calophylla var. microstyla, commonly known as the dwarf cuphea, is a compact, herbaceous shrub native to tropical regions of Central America. It features small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for containers or as a border plant in gardens."
