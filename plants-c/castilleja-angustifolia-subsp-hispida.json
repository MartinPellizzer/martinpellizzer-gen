    "intro": "Castilleja angustifolia subsp. hispida, commonly known as the hispid castilleja, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its roots. The plant features reddish to orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine, bristly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands."
