    "intro": "Circaea caulescens var. rosulata, commonly known as the rose-leaved whitebeard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is closely related to other species in the Primulaceae family, sharing similar floral structures and ecological preferences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments."
