    "intro": "Carex vexilis, commonly known as the broadleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, consist of small, spike-like clusters of brownish or greenish flowers. Carex vexilis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
