    "intro": "Cheilanthes kuhnii f. efarinosa, commonly known as the pale fringed rock fern, is a fern species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive pale midrib. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This fern is often found in crevices and on rock surfaces, showcasing its ability to survive in harsh environments."
