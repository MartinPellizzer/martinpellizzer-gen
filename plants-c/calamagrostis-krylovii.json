It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing wetland habitats."
