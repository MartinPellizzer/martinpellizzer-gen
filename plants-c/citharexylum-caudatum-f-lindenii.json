    "intro": "Citharexylum caudatum f. lindenii, commonly known as the Lindenhorn or Lindenhorn shrub, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for garden use in warm climates. The varietal form f. lindenii is distinguished by its more compact shape and enhanced flowering characteristics compared to the typical form."
