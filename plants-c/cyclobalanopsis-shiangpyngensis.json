    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis shiangpyngensis, commonly known as the Shiangpyng ironwood, is a species of evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Taiwan. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, dense wood. The tree typically grows in humid, subtropical climates and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a glossy surface, while its acorn-like fruits are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
