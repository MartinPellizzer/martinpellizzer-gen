    "intro": "Cotoneaster majusculus, commonly known as the dwarf cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, compact growth with small, ovate leaves that are glossy green above and pale beneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant seasonal color changes and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Cotoneaster majusculus is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and visual appeal."
