    "intro": "Cyclophyllum urophyllum, commonly known as the spiral bladdergrass, is a unique plant characterized by its distinctive spiral-shaped inflorescence. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features small, bladder-like structures that enclose its flowers, giving it a unique appearance. These bladders are thought to aid in seed dispersal by wind. Cyclophyllum urophyllum is often found in moist, lowland areas and is of interest to botanists due to its unusual morphology."
