    "intro": "Cyperus hermaphroditus var. angustior, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, triangular seeds that are dispersed by water or wind. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
