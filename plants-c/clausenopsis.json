    "intro": "Clausenopsis, commonly known as the desert rose or false rose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their succulent, often branching stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Clausenopsis species typically have small, leathery leaves and produce fruits that are capsule-like in shape. These plants are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance."
