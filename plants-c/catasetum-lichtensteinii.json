    "intro": "Catasetum lichtensteinii, commonly known as the Lichtenstein's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to regions of Africa, particularly South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a vibrant yellow or orange color with a distinctive, often hooded lip. The plant produces a unique structure called a galea, which is a specialized pollination mechanism that aids in attracting specific pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Catasetum lichtensteinii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
