    "intro": "Centrapalus pauciflorus, commonly known as the sparse-flower centrapalus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem and pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically appearing at the base of the leaves. Its fruits are usually drupes, containing a single seed, and it is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
