    "intro": "Coelopleurum trichocarpum f. epichnoum, commonly known as the epichnous form of the hairy fruit bramble, is a rare botanical variant characterized by its unique growth habit and morphological features. This form exhibits a more prostrate growth pattern compared to the typical upright structure of the species, with stems that often lie close to the ground. The leaves are typically smaller and more densely arranged, contributing to its distinct appearance. It is distinguished by its specialized inflorescences and the structure of its fruits, which differ from the standard form. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its potential ecological adaptations and genetic variability."
