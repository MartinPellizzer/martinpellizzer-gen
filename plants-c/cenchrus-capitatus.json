    "intro": "Cenchrus capitatus, commonly known as the bearded grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive, bristly inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine hairs, while its flowering heads are compact and often pink or red in color. Cenchrus capitatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
