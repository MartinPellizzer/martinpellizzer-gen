It is a hybrid between Carex acutata and Carex lyngbyei, resulting in a plant with unique morphological characteristics. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and pond edges, and thrives in full to partial sunlight. Its leaves are grass-like, arranged in dense tufts, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often wind-pollinated. Carex \u00d7 filkukae is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
