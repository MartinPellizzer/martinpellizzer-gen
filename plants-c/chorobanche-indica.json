    "intro": "Chorobanche indica, commonly known as the common beggar's ticks, is an annual flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers and hairy stems. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it can compete with native plants and is sometimes considered a weed."
