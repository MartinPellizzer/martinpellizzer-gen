    "intro": "Caryota rumphiana, commonly known as the giant fishtail palm, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant has a slender, unbranched trunk that often remains hidden beneath its expansive foliage. Its leaves are composed of numerous narrow, feather-like segments that radiate from a central point. Caryota rumphiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
