    "intro": "Campanula rapunculus var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, though the 'glabrata' variety is distinguished by its smoother texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in gardens."
