    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis var. dentata, commonly known as the toothed water-crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wet meadows and marshy areas. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically heart-shaped with serrated or toothed edges. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a dense, upright cluster. Its leaves and stems are often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps retain moisture. This species is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in moist environments."
