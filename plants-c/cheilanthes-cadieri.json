It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Its spores are produced in small, clustered clusters on the underside of the fronds. Cheilanthes cadieri is often found growing on limestone or sandstone outcrops, showcasing its ability to colonize harsh environments."
