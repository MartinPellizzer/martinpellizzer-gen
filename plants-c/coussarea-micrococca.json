    "intro": "Coussarea micrococca, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and striking red or pink flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish color, though it is also considered a threatened species due to overharvesting. The botanical features of Coussarea micrococca make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
