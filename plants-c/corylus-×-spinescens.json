    "intro": "Corylus \u00d7 spinescens, commonly known as the spiny hazelnut, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the European hazel (Corylus avellana) and the Chinese hazel (Corylus chinensis). It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its spiny stems and oval, serrated leaves. The plant produces catkins and small, edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and nut production. Its botanical features make it a unique subject in horticultural and ecological studies."
