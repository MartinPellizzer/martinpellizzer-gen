    "intro": "Cystopteris dimidiata, commonly known as the common water clover, is a fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating on water surfaces. The plant has a rhizome that produces both roots and fronds, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are typically divided into three parts, with the middle segment often longer than the lateral ones. Cystopteris dimidiata thrives in moist, nutrient-rich environments such as ponds, wetlands, and stream edges."
