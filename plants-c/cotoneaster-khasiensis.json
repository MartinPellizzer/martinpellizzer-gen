It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits in the autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at moderate elevations. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
