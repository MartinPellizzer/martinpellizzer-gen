    "intro": "Celastrus strigillosus, commonly known as roughleaf staff-vine, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, elliptical leaves that are rough to the touch. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found along stream banks and in shaded understories. Its botanical features make it an important component of native ecosystems and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
