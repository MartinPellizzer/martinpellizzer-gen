    "intro": "Catasetum imschootianum, commonly known as the Imschoot's orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often feature a distinctive lip or labellum, which is a key feature in orchid pollination. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with a contrasting purple or red lip, and it produces small, greenish or brownish fruits. Catasetum imschootianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique floral structure."
