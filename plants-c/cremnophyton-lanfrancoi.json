It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and mountainous environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
