    "intro": "Carex oligocarpa var. hitchcockiana, commonly known as Hitchcock's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This variety is distinguished by its compact growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear brownish to reddish flowers. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a popular choice for wetland restoration and native plant gardens."
