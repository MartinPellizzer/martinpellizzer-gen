    "intro": "Calamagrostis hyperborea, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and slender, upright growth habit. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine tundra and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive blue-green hue that becomes more pronounced in full sun. Calamagrostis hyperborea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems."
