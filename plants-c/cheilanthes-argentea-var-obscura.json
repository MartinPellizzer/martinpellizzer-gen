    "intro": "Cheilanthes argentea var. obscura, commonly known as the silver frilled fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in silvery, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, often on cliffs or in crevices where it can retain moisture. It is a perennial plant with a rhizomatous growth habit, and its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fronds. The varietal form, obscura, is distinguished by its darker, more subdued coloration compared to the typical silver frilled fern."
