    "intro": "Cyathea auriculata, commonly known as the ear-shaped tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of fronds that are often broad and drooping, giving it an elegant appearance. Cyathea auriculata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its rhizome system supports its growth and helps it anchor in nutrient-rich soil."
