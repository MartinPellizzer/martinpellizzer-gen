    "intro": "Cissus plumeri, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or silver markings. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Cissus plumeri is also valued for its ability to climb and cover walls or trellises."
