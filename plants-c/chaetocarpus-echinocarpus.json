    "intro": "Chaetocarpus echinocarpus, commonly known as the spiny hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in clusters at the ends of branches. Its fruit is a spiny capsule that splits open to release seeds, a characteristic feature of the genus Chaetocarpus. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in coastal and disturbed habitats."
