    "intro": "Cicuta venenosa, commonly known as water hemlock, is a highly toxic plant belonging to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, umbrella-shaped clusters of white flowers. It is native to North America and thrives in wet, disturbed soils along stream banks and roadsides. The plant contains potent toxic compounds, primarily cicutoxin, which can cause severe poisoning in humans and animals upon ingestion. Its roots and stems are the most toxic parts, and the plant is often mistaken for edible plants like parsley or carrots. Due to its extreme toxicity, it is considered one of the most dangerous plants in North America."
