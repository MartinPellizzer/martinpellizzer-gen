    "intro": "Cyperus grayi, commonly known as the gray flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or reddish in color, often resembling those of other sedges. Cyperus grayi thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and wetlands, and is often found in disturbed soils. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
