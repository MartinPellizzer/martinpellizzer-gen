    "intro": "Coreocarpus insularis, commonly known as the Kauai ironwood, is a rare endemic tree species native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and sturdy, woody structure, which helps it withstand the island's strong coastal winds. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique botanical species."
