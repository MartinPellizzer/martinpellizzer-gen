    "intro": "Corylus americana var. indehiscens, commonly known as the beaked hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the hazelnut family (Corylaceae) and is characterized by its elongated, beak-like buds that remain closed throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by oval, edible nuts that mature in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. This variety is notable for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
