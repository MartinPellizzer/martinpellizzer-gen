    "intro": "Catalpa catalpa, commonly known as the northern catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The tree produces long, bean-like pods that contain sticky, inedible seeds. Catalpa catalpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also known for its role in supporting local wildlife, particularly caterpillars of the catalpa sphinx moth. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for urban and suburban landscapes."
