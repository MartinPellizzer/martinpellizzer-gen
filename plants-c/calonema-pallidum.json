    "intro": "Calonema pallidum, commonly known as the pale calonema, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many ornamental and tropical plants. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are typically pale green or yellow, with five petals and a distinctive tubular shape. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, Calonema pallidum is considered a rare and endangered species."
