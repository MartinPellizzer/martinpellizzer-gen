It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Cyathea tenera is often found in humid, shaded environments such as tropical rainforests."
