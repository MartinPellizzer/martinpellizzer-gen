    "intro": "Chlamydanthus thymelaea, commonly known as the velvetleaf or thyme-leaved speedwell, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas. Chlamydanthus thymelaea is a perennial herb that spreads through stolons, forming dense mats in suitable habitats."
