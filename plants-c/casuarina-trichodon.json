    "intro": "Casuarina trichodon, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like foliage that resembles the structure of a pine tree. The plant thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salty air and sandy soils. It produces small, woody cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Casuarina trichodon plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
