    "intro": "Coryphantha greenwoodii, commonly known as the Greenwald's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense clusters of spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by the development of edible, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Coryphantha greenwoodii is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
