    "intro": "Coluteastrum candidum, commonly known as white sand mustards, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Coluteastrum candidum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
