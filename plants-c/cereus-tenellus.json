    "intro": "Cereus tenellus, commonly known as the ghost flower or night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing plant with a short, thick stem and spiny, paddle-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance. These flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a single night before wilting. Cereus tenellus is well adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system to access water from underground sources."
