    "intro": "Cyperus discigerus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. It has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow or brown flowers. Cyperus discigerus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
