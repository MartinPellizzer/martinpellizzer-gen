    "intro": "Cylicodaphne polyneura, commonly known as the laceleaf sago palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, feather-like fronds that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant has a short, stout trunk and produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by bright red berries. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and attractive foliage, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and indoor spaces."
