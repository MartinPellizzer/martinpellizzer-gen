    "intro": "Calandrinia coquimbensis, commonly known as the Coquimbo sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Chile. It is a low-growing perennial that produces vibrant pink to red flowers, which bloom in late spring and early summer. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Calandrinia coquimbensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
