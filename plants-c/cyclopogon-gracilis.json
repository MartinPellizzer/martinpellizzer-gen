    "intro": "Cyclopogon gracilis, commonly known as the slender cyclopogon, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of many monocot species. Cyclopogon gracilis is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and swampy areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially threatened species."
