    "intro": "Carex manca var. contigua, commonly known as the slender sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is typically found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. The plant is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
