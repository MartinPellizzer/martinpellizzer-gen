    "intro": "Crataegus villicarpa, commonly known as the silky crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, yellow or orange fruits that are edible but generally not favored by humans. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The silky crabapple is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
