    "intro": "Codazzia dentata, commonly known as the toothed codazzia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, toothed leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are clustered in loose panicles. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Codazzia dentata thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of hardwood forests."
