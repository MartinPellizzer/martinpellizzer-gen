    "intro": "Cocculus macrophyllus, commonly known as the large-leaf devil's bit, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, large leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by distinctive, fleshy, orange-red berries. Its berries contain a single, hard, black seed, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and vigorous growth habit."
