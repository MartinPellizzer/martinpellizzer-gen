    "intro": "Callicarpa cinnamomea, commonly known as the cinnamon beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces bright orange-red berries in the fall, which are edible but often considered too tart for consumption. Callicarpa cinnamomea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
