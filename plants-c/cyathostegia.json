    "intro": "Cyathostegia, commonly known as the \"false holly\" or \"honeycomb plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique, honeycomb-like bracts that enclose the small flowers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, and they are borne in clusters within the modified leaf-like structures called cyathia. Cyathostegia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their visual interest."
