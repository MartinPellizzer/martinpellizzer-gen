    "intro": "Cibotium spectabile, commonly known as the golden tree fern, is a striking evergreen plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its tall, tree-like structure with a stout, fibrous trunk covered in a layer of dead fronds. The plant produces large, shield-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length, giving it a dramatic appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Cibotium spectabile is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in shaded, moist environments with well-drained soil."
