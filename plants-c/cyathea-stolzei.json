It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, with a short rhizome that supports the trunk and a dense network of roots. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a long, upright rachis and numerous pinnae that give it a lush, tropical appearance. Cyathea stolzei is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking foliage and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
