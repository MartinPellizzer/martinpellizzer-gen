    "intro": "Crassula laticephala, commonly known as the Woolly Crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
