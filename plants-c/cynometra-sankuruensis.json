    "intro": "Cynometra sankuruensis, commonly known as the Congo ironwood, is a rare and valuable tree native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly sought after for its durability. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Cynometra sankuruensis is considered an endangered species."
