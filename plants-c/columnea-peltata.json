    "intro": "Columnea peltata, commonly known as the silverleaf columnea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting throat. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, meaning it attaches itself to other plants without being parasitic. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, with a distinctive waxy coating that gives it a silvery appearance. Columnea peltata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens."
