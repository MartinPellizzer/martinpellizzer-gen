    "intro": "Caryocar intermedium, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces clusters of hard, woody fruits that contain multiple seeds. The tree's most notable feature is its unique, helmet-shaped fruit, which splits open to release the edible Brazil nuts. The plant has a long lifespan and plays a crucial role in the ecological balance of its habitat. Its seeds are dispersed by animals, contributing to its wide distribution within the region."
