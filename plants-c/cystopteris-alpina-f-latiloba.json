    "intro": "Cystopteris alpina f. latiloba, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a fern species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, ovate to lanceolate fronds that are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in its natural habitat."
