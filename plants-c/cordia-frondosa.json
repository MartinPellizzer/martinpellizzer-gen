    "intro": "Cordia frondosa, commonly known as the broadleaf cordia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows up to 10 meters in height. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, often with a yellowish or greenish hue. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, fleshy seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
