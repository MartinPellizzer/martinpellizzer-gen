    "intro": "Caperonia heteropetala var. major, commonly known as the broad-leaved caperonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in cymes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments."
