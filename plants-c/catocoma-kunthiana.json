    "intro": "Catocoma kunthiana, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, lance-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in harsh, sandy soils. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, also plays a role in its ecological interactions."
