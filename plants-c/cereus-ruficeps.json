    "intro": "Cereus ruficeps, commonly known as the red-headed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its tall, spiny stems and striking red or orange flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening only for a few hours before closing. Cereus ruficeps is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit."
