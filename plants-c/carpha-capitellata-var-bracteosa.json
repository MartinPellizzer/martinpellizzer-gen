It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in moist soil conditions. It has fibrous roots and produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled berries.
