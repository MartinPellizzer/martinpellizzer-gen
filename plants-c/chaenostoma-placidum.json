    "intro": "Chaenostoma placidum, commonly known as the smooth water-milfoil, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. Its small, white flowers appear in early summer and are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Chaenostoma placidum plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
