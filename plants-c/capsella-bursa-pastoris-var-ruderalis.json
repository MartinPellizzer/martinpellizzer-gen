    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris var. ruderalis, commonly known as field pennycress, is a variant of the common weed species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in ruderal habitats. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variant is notable for its adaptability and resilience in harsh environmental conditions."
