    "intro": "Cryptanthus discolor, commonly known as the pink and white carnation or the pink and white tricolor, is a striking member of the Amaranthaceae family. Native to South America, particularly Brazil, it is known for its vibrant, showy flowers that display a unique combination of pink and white hues. The plant typically grows as a low-growing herb, reaching heights of about 10 to 20 centimeters. Its foliage consists of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Cryptanthus discolor thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
