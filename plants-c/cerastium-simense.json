    "intro": "Cerastium simense, commonly known as the creeping snowflake, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically forms a mat-like growth habit, with opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats. Cerastium simense is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
