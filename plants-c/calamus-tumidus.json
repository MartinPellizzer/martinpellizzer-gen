It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its robust, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its underground stems produce starchy tubers, which are edible and have been used as a food source. Calamus tumidus also plays a role in traditional crafts, with its leaves used for making mats and thatching."
