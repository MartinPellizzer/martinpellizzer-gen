    "intro": "Coffea anthonyi, commonly known as Anthony's coffee, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the highlands of Ethiopia, where it grows at elevations between 1,500 and 2,000 meters. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces red, fleshy berries that contain the seeds used for coffee. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists. Its unique genetic makeup may hold potential for developing new coffee varieties with improved traits."
