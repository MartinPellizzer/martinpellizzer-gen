    "intro": "Calanthe fissa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf calanthe, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Calanthe fissa thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. It is a popular choice for shade gardens and indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
