It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in estuaries and tidal zones. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically green or yellowish and appear in clusters. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
