It is a trailing or climbing vine characterized by its hairy, heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, round, green fruits that turn orange when mature. It is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
