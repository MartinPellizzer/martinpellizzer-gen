    "intro": "Cecropia gabrielis, commonly known as Gabriel's ceiba, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with Azteca ants, which inhabit the hollow stems and provide protection against herbivores. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that consume the fleshy, red berries. Cecropia gabrielis is often found in disturbed habitats and plays a significant role in ecological succession in tropical forests."
