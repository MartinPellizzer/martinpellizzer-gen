    "intro": "Chesneya polystichoides subsp. bhutanica, commonly known as the Bhutanese fern, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the mountainous regions of Bhutan. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that resemble those of a fern. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in shaded forest understories at high altitudes. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
