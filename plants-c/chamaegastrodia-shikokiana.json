It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a distinctive dark purple to blackish floral structure, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, preferring rich, organic soil. Its flowers are usually solitary and bloom during late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
