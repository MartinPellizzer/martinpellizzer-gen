    "intro": "Cyanea coriacea var. spathulata, commonly known as the Hawaiian tree fern, is a striking plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a thick layer of fibrous, coriaceous tissue. The plant produces large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach several meters in length, giving it a distinctive, tree-like appearance. Its spathulate (spade-shaped) leaves are a defining feature of this variety. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforest ecosystems."
