    "intro": "Carara didyma, commonly known as the white-flowered spider orchid, is a tropical orchid native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and clusters of small, white flowers that resemble spider-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of rainforests. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, adapted to maximize light absorption in low-light conditions. Carara didyma is valued for its unique floral morphology and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
