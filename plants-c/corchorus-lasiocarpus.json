    "intro": "Corchorus lasiocarpus, commonly known as the woolly knotweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its fibrous roots and stems have been historically used for textile fibers, although it is not as commercially significant as other members of the Corchorus genus. The species is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
