    "intro": "Cardamine uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and a single, small white or pale yellow flower that appears at the top of a slender stem. Native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions, it thrives in woodland floors and along stream banks. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and often overlooked member of the watercress genus."
