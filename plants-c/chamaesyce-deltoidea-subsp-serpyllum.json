    "intro": "Chamaesyce deltoidea subsp. serpyllum, commonly known as the broadleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to sandy and rocky soils in the western United States. It has small, deltoid-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom from spring to summer. It is often found in open habitats such as dunes, gravelly slopes, and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh, dry conditions."
