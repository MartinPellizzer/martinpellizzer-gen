    "intro": "Consolida glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky false bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and showy, spurred flowers. The plant produces small, pea-like pods that contain seeds, typical of the legume family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its sticky hairs on the stems and leaves help in deterring herbivores and reducing water loss."
