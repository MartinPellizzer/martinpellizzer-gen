    "intro": "Cnicus misilmerensis, commonly known as the Misilmer Island thistle, is a flowering plant native to the island of Misilmer in the Mediterranean. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal environments, adapting to saline and well-drained soils. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
