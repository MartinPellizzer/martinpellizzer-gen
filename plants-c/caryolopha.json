    "intro": "Caryolopha, commonly known as the false heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. Caryolopha species are native to regions of southern Africa, where they thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. The flowers are often pink or white, and they bloom in late summer or early autumn. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to grow in challenging environments."
