    "intro": "Cipura northiana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or yellow. Its fruits are woody capsules that release seeds when mature. Due to overharvesting, Cipura northiana is now classified as an endangered species."
