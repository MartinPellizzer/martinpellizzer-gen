    "intro": "Caulanthus glaucus, commonly known as the silverleaf silversword, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, a feature that helps it survive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces striking, spiky inflorescences with showy white to pink flowers that bloom in the spring. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Caulanthus glaucus is considered a rare and endangered species."
