    "intro": "Cedrela balansae, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in panicles. The tree's heartwood is highly valued for its fine grain and durability, making it a sought-after timber species. It typically grows in lowland tropical forests and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
