    "intro": "Crataegus rubella, commonly known as the red hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are edible but typically unpalatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and scrublands. Crataegus rubella is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
