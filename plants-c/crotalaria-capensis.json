    "intro": "Crotalaria capensis, commonly known as the African burr or yellow crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 1 meter in height, featuring alternate, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its seeds are encased in spiny pods, a characteristic that aids in seed dispersal by attachment to animals or clothing. Crotalaria capensis is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
