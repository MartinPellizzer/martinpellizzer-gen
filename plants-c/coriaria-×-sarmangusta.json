    "intro": "Coriaria \u00d7 sarmangusta, commonly known as the hybrid boxwood, is a deciduous shrub that combines traits from its parent species, Coriaria monogyna and Coriaria myrtifolia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, compact foliage with small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. Due to its hybrid nature, it is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and hardy growth habits."
