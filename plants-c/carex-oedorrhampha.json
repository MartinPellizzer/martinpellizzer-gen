    "intro": "Carex oedorrhampha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. Carex oedorrhampha is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
