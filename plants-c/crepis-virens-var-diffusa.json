    "intro": "Crepis virens var. diffusa, commonly known as the hairy crested wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. Its leaves are hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
