    "intro": "Centrosema decumbens, commonly known as hairy beggar's tick, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for forage or as a cover crop. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in soil enrichment and ecological restoration efforts."
