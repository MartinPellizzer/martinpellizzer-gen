    "intro": "Crataegus nitidula var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds and mammals but generally unpalatable to humans. Its leaves are oval with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
