    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris var. prostrata, commonly known as mat-forming heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to western Europe. It features dense, mat-like growth with small, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense ground cover in garden settings."
