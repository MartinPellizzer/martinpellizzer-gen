    "intro": "Cladium complanatum, commonly known as the flatleaf sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its flat, blade-like leaves that are typically green and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often found at the base of the leaves. Cladium complanatum thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes and wetlands, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems. Its morphology and growth habits make it an important indicator species for wetland health."
