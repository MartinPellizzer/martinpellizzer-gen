    "intro": "Cucurbita maxima var. aromatica, commonly known as the sweet pumpkin or sugar pumpkin, is a widely cultivated variety of squash. It is characterized by its smooth, orange to yellow skin and dense, sweet flesh that is rich in beta-carotene. This plant is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and gourds. It typically grows as a trailing vine with large, heart-shaped leaves and produces both male and female flowers. The fruit is often used in cooking, baking, and as a source of nutrition due to its high vitamin A content."
