    "intro": "Carludovica longicrura, commonly known as the long-stemmed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Carludovica longicrura is adapted to survive in harsh, low-nutrient environments through its efficient water storage and photosynthetic mechanisms."
