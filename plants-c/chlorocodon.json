    "intro": "Chlorocodon, commonly known as the greenfinch, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their finely divided, feather-like leaves that give them a delicate appearance. Chlorocodon species typically produce small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, which are common in the carrot family. They are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value."
