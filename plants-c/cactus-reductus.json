    "intro": "Cactus reductus, commonly known as the reduced cactus, is a unique species characterized by its minimalistic structure. It features a short, cylindrical stem with sparse spines, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, pale flowers that bloom during brief periods of rainfall. Its leaves are reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration. This plant exemplifies xerophytic adaptations, thriving in desert conditions with minimal water availability."
