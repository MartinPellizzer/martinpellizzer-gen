    "intro": "Chimonobambusa quadrangularis f. sotaroana, commonly known as the Sotaroana bamboo, is a rare and ornamental bamboo species native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, upright culms with a distinctive quadrangular cross-section, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are typically not showy. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
