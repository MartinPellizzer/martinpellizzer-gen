    "intro": "Crepidium oliganthum, commonly known as the rare orchid of the genus Crepidium, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and a single, slender stem that bears a few leaves. The plant produces a small number of flowers, typically fewer than five, which are usually pale green to white in color. Its flowers are notable for their intricate structure and are often clustered at the base of the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Crepidium oliganthum is considered a rare and endangered species."
