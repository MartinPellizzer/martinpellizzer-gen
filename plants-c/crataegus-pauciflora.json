    "intro": "Crataegus pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, including China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to elliptical leaves, and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The fruit is a red or orange-red berry that ripens in the fall, providing food for birds and small mammals. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forest edges, rocky slopes, and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
