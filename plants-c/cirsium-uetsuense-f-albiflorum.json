    "intro": "Cirsium uetsuense f. albiflorum, commonly known as the whiteflowered thistle, is a unique botanical variant of the Uetsu thistle. It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the typical purple or blue hues of the species. This form exhibits reduced flowering intensity and a more open plant structure compared to the typical form. It is native to Japan and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's botanical interest lies in its distinctive floral coloration and its role in regional plant diversity."
