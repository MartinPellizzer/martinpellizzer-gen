    "intro": "Cola edeensis, commonly known as the Nigerian cola nut, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to West Africa, particularly Nigeria, and is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and showy, red flowers. The plant produces oval, woody pods that contain stimulant-rich seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of caffeine. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its economic and cultural significance, it is often cultivated in regions where it is native."
