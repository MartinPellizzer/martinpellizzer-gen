    "intro": "Cyclosorus decadens, commonly known as the delicate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that often form a rosette shape, allowing it to thrive in shallow, still waters. The plant typically grows in nutrient-rich, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, enabling it to colonize new areas and form dense mats. Cyclosorus decadens plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
