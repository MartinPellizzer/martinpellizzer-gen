    "intro": "Carex commersoniana, commonly known as Commerson's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, strap-shaped leaves and cylindrical flower clusters. Native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, it thrives in moist, temperate environments. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled berries. It is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other moist habitats, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
