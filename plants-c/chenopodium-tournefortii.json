    "intro": "Chenopodium tournefortii, commonly known as desert goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that grows close to the ground, often forming dense mats in sandy or rocky soils. The plant has alternate, ovate to rhombic leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Chenopodium tournefortii is also used in traditional medicine by some Native American tribes."
