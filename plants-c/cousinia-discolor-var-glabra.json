    "intro": "Cousinia discolor var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers. The leaves are typically linear and covered with a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. It is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
