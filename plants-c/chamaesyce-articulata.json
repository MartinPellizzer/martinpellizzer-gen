    "intro": "Chamaesyce articulata, commonly known as the jointed spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its flowers are clustered in cup-shaped structures called cyathia, which contain both male and female reproductive parts. Chamaesyce articulata is often found in disturbed areas and is known for its ability to spread rapidly through both seeds and vegetative means."
