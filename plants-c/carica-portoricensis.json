It belongs to the Caricaceae family and is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and distinctive, fragrant flowers. The plant produces a fleshy, orange-colored fruit that is rich in enzymes like papain, which is used in food and medicine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
