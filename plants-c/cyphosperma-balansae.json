    "intro": "Cyphosperma balansae, commonly known as the Balansae cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. Native to the island of Madagascar, this plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. Cyphosperma balansae is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often reaching several decades in age. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
