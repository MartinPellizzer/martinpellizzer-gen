It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with prominent white or silver markings. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers on tall, slender stems, which are followed by small, fleshy berries. Chlorophytum ramulosum is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and its ability to improve indoor air quality."
