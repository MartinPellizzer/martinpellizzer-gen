    "intro": "Centrachena viscida, commonly known as the sticky centra or sticky centra vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy berries that contain seeds, and the plant is often found in humid, shaded environments. Due to its sticky secretions, it has been used in traditional medicine and for natural adhesives."
