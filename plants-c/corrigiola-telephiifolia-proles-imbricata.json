    "intro": "Corrigiola telephiifolia proles imbricata, commonly known as the coastal sandspurry, is a low-growing annual herb native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It features prostrate or ascending stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The leaves are oblanceolate to elliptic, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers are yellow with five petals, typically appearing in clusters at the base of the stems. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of coastal vegetation."
