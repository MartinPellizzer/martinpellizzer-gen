    "intro": "Campecarpus fulcitus, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It has adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water and high temperatures. Campecarpus fulcitus plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
