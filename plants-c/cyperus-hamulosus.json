    "intro": "Cyperus hamulosus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf flatsedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense stands in wetlands and along waterways. Its slender, grass-like leaves are usually less than 1 meter in length, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Cyperus hamulosus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
