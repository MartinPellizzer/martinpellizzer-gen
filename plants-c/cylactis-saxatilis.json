    "intro": "Cylactis saxatilis, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. It thrives in rocky, arid environments, often found on limestone or granite surfaces. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the fungal and photosynthetic partners. It plays a crucial role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in harsh environments. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health."
