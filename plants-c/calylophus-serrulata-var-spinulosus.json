    "intro": "Calylophus serrulata var. spinulosus, commonly known as the spinylipped spikerush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, ribbed leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are usually greenish or brownish, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is distinguished by its finely serrated leaf margins and the presence of short, bristly structures along the leaf edges."
