    "intro": "Cedrela toona var. pilistila, commonly known as the Philippine mahogany or pilistila, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Meliaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale to reddish-brown bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its durable, lightweight timber, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
