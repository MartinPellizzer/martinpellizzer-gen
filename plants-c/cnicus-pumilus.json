    "intro": "Cnicus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf sow thistle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches a height of only a few inches, with a rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Cnicus pumilus is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
