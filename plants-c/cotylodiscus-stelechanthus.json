    "intro": "Cotylodiscus stelechanthus, commonly known as the laceleaf liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that form a rosette structure, often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are borne on short, upright stalks and produce spores for propagation. Cotylodiscus stelechanthus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for small invertebrates."
