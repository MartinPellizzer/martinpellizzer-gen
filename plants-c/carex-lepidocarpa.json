    "intro": "Carex lepidocarpa, commonly known as the silver-scaled sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and pond edges. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, consist of small, spikelet-like flowers. Carex lepidocarpa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
