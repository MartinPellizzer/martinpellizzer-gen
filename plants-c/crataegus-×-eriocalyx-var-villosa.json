    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 eriocalyx var. villosa, commonly known as the downy hawthorn, is a hybrid species within the genus Crataegus. It is characterized by its hairy or pubescent stems and leaves, which give it its varietal name \"villosa.\" The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized shrub or tree, often reaching heights of 3 to 8 meters. Its flowers are generally white or pink, appearing in clusters, and the fruit is a red or orange pome that ripens in the fall. This species is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils."
