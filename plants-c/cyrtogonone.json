    "intro": "Cyrtogonone, commonly known as the \"milkweed of the New World,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. These plants are characterized by their milky sap, which is a common feature among members of the Apocynaceae family. Cyrtogonone species typically have opposite leaves and produce showy, often yellow or orange flowers. They are native to regions of the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. The plant's structure and chemical composition make it an important species in ecological and medicinal studies."
