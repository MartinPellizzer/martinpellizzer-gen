    "intro": "Cylindropuntia acanthocarpa subsp. acanthocarpa, commonly known as the thorned cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are segmented and covered in spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure. The subspecies is notable for its ability to form dense clumps, contributing to the ecological structure of its habitat."
