    "intro": "Cephalocereus royenii, commonly known as the royal night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and clusters of white, nocturnal flowers that bloom only during the evening. The plant has spines that are typically pale yellow to brown, and its leaves are reduced to spines, typical of many cacti. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. The blooming period occurs primarily in the spring and is a striking display of its botanical features."
