    "intro": "Conyza intermedia, commonly known as common ironweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Conyza intermedia is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential ecological and medicinal properties."
