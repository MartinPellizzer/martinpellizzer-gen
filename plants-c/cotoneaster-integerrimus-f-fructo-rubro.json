    "intro": "Cotoneaster integerrimus f. fructo-rubro, commonly known as the red-fruited cotoneaster, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, followed by vibrant red berries in autumn, which are an attractive feature. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative hedge. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental value and hardiness in temperate climates."
