    "intro": "Chrysanthemum alpinum f. tatrae, commonly known as the Tatra chrysanthemum, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the Tatra Mountains in Central Europe. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions. It plays a significant role in the local ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
