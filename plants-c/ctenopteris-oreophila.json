    "intro": "Ctenopteris oreophila, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinct, elegant appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Ctenopteris oreophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
