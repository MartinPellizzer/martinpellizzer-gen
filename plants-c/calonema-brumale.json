It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in late autumn to early spring, producing vivid purple or red flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Calonema brumale thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to bright light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening in cooler climates. Its unique appearance and seasonal blooming make it a desirable addition to both gardens and collections."
