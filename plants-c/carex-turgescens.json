    "intro": "Carex turgescens, commonly known as the bulblet sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes and bogs. Its rhizomes are thick and often form bulb-like structures, which help it spread vegetatively. Carex turgescens plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms."
