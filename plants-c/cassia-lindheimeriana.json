    "intro": "Cassia lindheimeriana, commonly known as Lindheimer's cassia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 20 centimeters long and composed of 8 to 14 pairs of ovate leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in terminal panicles. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Cassia lindheimeriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
