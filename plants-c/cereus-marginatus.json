    "intro": "Cereus marginatus, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, columnar stems. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that are typically pink or yellow, blooming at night. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. While it is often cultivated as a decorative plant, it requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
