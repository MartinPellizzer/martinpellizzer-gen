    "intro": "Cheilanthes aschenborniana, commonly known as the aschenborn's rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial plant that thrives in rocky, arid environments, often growing on cliffs or in crevices. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are resistant to drought. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This species is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in its native habitat."
