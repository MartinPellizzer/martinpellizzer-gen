    "intro": "Codonoraphia catalpiflora, commonly known as the Catalpa-flowered Codonoraphia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Codonoraphiaceae and is characterized by its unique, showy inflorescences that resemble the floral structures of catalpa trees. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in tropical or subtropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
