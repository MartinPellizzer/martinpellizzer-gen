    "intro": "Crataegus hispidula, commonly known as the hispid hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and white to pinkish flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Crataegus hispidula is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along streambanks, thriving in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant communities and a subject of interest in ecological and horticultural studies."
