    "intro": "Cleidion ramosii var. ramosii, commonly known as the hairy sycamore, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, typically blooming in the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
