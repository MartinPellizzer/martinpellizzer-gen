    "intro": "Chrysosplenium pseudofauriei, commonly known as the golden spleenwort, is a member of the Saxifragaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, often hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Native to mountainous regions in East Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's foliage is typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
