    "intro": "Carex tristis, commonly known as the sad sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated. Carex tristis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
