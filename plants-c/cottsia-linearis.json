    "intro": "Cottsia linearis, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are extensively branched, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Cottsia linearis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
