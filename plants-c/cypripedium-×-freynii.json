    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 freynii, commonly known as the Freyn's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, typically ranging in color from white to pink or yellow. The plant features a single, erect stem with broad, pleated leaves, and its roots are adapted to thrive in cool, moist, shaded environments. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is often found in forest understories where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
