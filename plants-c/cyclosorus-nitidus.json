    "intro": "Cyclosorus nitidus, commonly known as the smooth cyclosorus, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a thalloid structure with a dorsiventral differentiation, typical of many leafy liverworts. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern and are smooth and glossy, giving it its common name. Cyclosorus nitidus plays a role in nutrient cycling in its habitat and is often used as an indicator of undisturbed, humid ecosystems."
