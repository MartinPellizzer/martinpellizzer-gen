    "intro": "Cladogynos orientalis, commonly known as the oriental cladogynos, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are simple and alternate, often with a velvety texture, while its stems are woody and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cladogynos orientalis is considered a botanically significant species with potential ecological and medicinal value."
