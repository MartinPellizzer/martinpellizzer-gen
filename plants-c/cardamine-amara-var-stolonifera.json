    "intro": "Cardamine amara var. stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, glossy leaves with a peppery aroma, and its stems are stoloniferous, allowing it to spread vegetatively along the ground. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in terminal umbels. Its leaves and stems are edible, often used in salads or as a garnish, and it thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland floors."
