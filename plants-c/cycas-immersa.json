    "intro": "Cycas immersa, commonly known as the underwater cycad, is a unique species of cycad native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base of the plant and female cones emerging from the upper part of the trunk. Cycas immersa is adapted to saline and waterlogged soils, often growing in tidal zones where it is partially submerged. This rare and endangered species is of significant ecological importance in its native habitat."
