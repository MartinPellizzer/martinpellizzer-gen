    "intro": "Carex andina, commonly known as Andean sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known for their narrow leaves and spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in its native habitat. Carex andina is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging growing conditions."
