    "intro": "Chrysocyathus amurensis, commonly known as the Amur chrysocyathus, is a rare and unique marine sponge found primarily in the coastal waters of the Sea of Japan. It belongs to the family Spirillidae and is characterized by its delicate, branching structure composed of calcareous spicules. The sponge's coloration can vary from yellow to orange, depending on environmental conditions and light exposure. It plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
