    "intro": "Callitriche stagnalis var. rivularis, commonly known as the river water-star, is a small aquatic plant found in slow-moving freshwater habitats. It typically grows in shallow waters, often near the edges of rivers and streams. The plant has slender, floating or submerged stems with small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in whorls. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and borne in clusters, contributing to its delicate appearance. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as a food source for herbivorous fish."
