    "intro": "Clinopodium procumbens, commonly known as creeping oregano, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It features small, aromatic leaves that are often used in culinary applications, similar to oregano. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its creeping growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it useful for ground cover in rocky or dry soils. Clinopodium procumbens is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun."
