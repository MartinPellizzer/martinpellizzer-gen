    "intro": "Cardamine impatiens f. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf watercress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist, temperate regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers. The plant thrives in shady, wet environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its foliage is often used in culinary applications, though it is less common than its larger relative, watercress. The subspecies f. humilis is distinguished by its shorter stature and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Cardamine impatiens."
