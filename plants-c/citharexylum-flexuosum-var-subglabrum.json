It is characterized by its slender, often climbing stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are often glabrous or nearly so, giving it a smooth, polished appearance.
