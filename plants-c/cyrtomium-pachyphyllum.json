    "intro": "Cyrtomium pachyphyllum, commonly known as the thick-leaf holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a broad, upright growth habit. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its rhizomatous structure allows it to spread slowly, forming clumps over time. Cyrtomium pachyphyllum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to add a lush, tropical feel to shaded garden spaces."
