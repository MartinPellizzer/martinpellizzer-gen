    "intro": "Cuscuta abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks leaves, stems, and roots. It attaches itself to host plants using specialized haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract nutrients. This species is native to Africa and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its small, yellowish flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces tiny, dry fruits that contain its seeds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken or even kill its host plants."
