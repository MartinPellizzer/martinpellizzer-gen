    "intro": "Centaurea alba subsp. aristifera, commonly known as the white knapweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and bright yellow flowers that are surrounded by white ray florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, elongated seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is often mistaken for other Centaurea species due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its specific leaf and flower structure."
