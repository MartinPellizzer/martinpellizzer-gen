    "intro": "Congea involucratum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Indian velvet, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is native to Africa, southern Asia, and the Pacific Islands, and is often found in moist, disturbed habitats. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions."
