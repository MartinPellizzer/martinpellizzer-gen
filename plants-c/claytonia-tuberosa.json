It is characterized by its rosette of heart-shaped, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. It has a tuberous root system that stores nutrients and helps it survive in its natural habitat. Claytonia tuberosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
