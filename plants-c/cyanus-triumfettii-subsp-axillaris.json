    "intro": "Cyanus triumfettii subsp. axillaris, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive blue to purple composite flowers, which are arranged in a single, showy head. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and sunny conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with hairy surfaces, and it produces small, elongated bracts beneath the flower head. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in alpine ecosystems and its ornamental value in horticulture."
