    "intro": "Cynanchum trichophyllum, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Cynanchum trichophyllum is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in steppes and rocky areas."
