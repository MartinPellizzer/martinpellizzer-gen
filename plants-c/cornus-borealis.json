It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red or purple berries that attract birds. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth margin and turn vibrant yellow in the fall. Cornus borealis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in forest ecosystems."
