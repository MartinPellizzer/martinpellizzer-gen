    "intro": "Clethra fabri var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed Chinese clethra, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the Clethra genus. It is native to specific regions in China, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a smooth, glossy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically interesting but endangered species."
