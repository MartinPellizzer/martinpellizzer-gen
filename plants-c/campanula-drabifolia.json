    "intro": "Campanula drabifolia, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Campanula drabifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
