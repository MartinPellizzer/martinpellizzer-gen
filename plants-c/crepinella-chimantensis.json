    "intro": "Crepinella chimantensis, commonly known as the Chimant\u00e9 crepefruit, is a species of flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of northern South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with lance-shaped leaves and woody stems. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, round fruits that are edible when mature. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
