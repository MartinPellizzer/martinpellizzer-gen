    "intro": "Carex parvigluma, commonly known as the small-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually a dark green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex parvigluma is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes many other sedges and related plants. It plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
