    "intro": "Caragana intermedia, commonly known as the Siberian peashrub, is a deciduous shrub native to Central Asia and parts of Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 11 pairs of leaflets, and its yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, edible legumes that are often used in traditional medicine. It is adapted to harsh environments, including sandy soils and arid conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species. Caragana intermedia is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded areas."
