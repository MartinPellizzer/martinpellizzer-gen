    "intro": "Commiphora ruahensis, commonly known as the East African myrrh tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the tropical regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh-producing species. The plant is characterized by its thick, aromatic bark and small, clustered leaves. It produces a resinous sap that has been historically used for medicinal and aromatic purposes. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered threatened in some regions."
