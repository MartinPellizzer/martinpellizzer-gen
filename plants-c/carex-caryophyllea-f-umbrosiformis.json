    "intro": "Carex caryophyllea f. umbrosiformis, commonly known as the shadowy sedge, is a variant of the common sedge species native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that form compact clumps. The plant produces small, clustered brownish flowers in late summer, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wet or damp soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream edges. This ornamental plant is valued for its ability to add texture and contrast to shaded garden spaces."
