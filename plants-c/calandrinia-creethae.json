    "intro": "Calandrinia creethae, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, fleshy leaves and compact growth habit make it well-adapted to drought conditions. Calandrinia creethae is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
