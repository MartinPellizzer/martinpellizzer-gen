    "intro": "Chlorocharis, commonly known as the common green alga, is a genus of freshwater green algae belonging to the family Chlorococcales. These algae are characterized by their simple, unicellular structure and the presence of chlorophyll a and b, which enable photosynthesis. They typically form dense blooms in nutrient-rich waters, contributing to the ecological dynamics of aquatic ecosystems. Chlorocharis species are often found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams, where they play a role in the food web. Their rapid reproduction can sometimes lead to water quality issues if populations become excessive."
