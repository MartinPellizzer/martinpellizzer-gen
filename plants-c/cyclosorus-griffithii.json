    "intro": "Cyclosorus griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's cyclosorus, is a rare and enigmatic fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that exhibit a distinctive, curling pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus griffithii is considered a species of conservation concern."
