    "intro": "Catasetum tabulare var. pallidum, commonly known as the pale cat claw orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, claw-like sepals and petals that resemble a cat's claw, hence its common name. The plant produces striking yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive, elongated spur. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. This orchid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for with proper light and moisture conditions."
