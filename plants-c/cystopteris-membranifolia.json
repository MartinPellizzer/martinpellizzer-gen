    "intro": "Cystopteris membranifolia, commonly known as the membranous shield fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to regions in the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fertile fronds that produce spores on the underside. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a narrow, membranous texture that gives it its common name. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
