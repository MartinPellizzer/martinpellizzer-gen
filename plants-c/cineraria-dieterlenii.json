It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features silvery-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, preferring well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
