    "intro": "Callitriche palustris subsp. palustris, commonly known as marsh stitchwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and slow-moving water bodies. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats near the water's edge. The plant has small, oval leaves that are usually submerged or floating, and it produces tiny white or pink flowers in early summer. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, calm waters. This species plays an important role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
