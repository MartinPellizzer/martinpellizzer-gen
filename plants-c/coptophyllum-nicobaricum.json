    "intro": "Coptophyllum nicobaricum, commonly known as the Nicobar orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the Nicobar Islands. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, upright stem and produces small, pale greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments. It is listed as critically endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical research."
