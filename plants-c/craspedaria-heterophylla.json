    "intro": "Craspedaria heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its morphologically variable leaves, which can range from needle-like to broad and spoon-shaped depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophytes, are borne on the leaf surfaces. Craspedaria heterophylla plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
