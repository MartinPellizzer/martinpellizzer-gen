    "intro": "Crinum longifolium var. riparium, commonly known as the river crinum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features strap-like, narrow leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, adapted to thrive in wet or marshy environments. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight along riverbanks and wetlands. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats."
