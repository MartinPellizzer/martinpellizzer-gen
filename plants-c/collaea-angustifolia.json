    "intro": "Collaea angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved collaea, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of South America. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
