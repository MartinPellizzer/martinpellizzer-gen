    "intro": "Comocladia dentata, commonly known as the coastal sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has small, toothed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt, adapting to its saline environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines and is often found in dune ecosystems. Comocladia dentata plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
