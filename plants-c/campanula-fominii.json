    "intro": "Campanula fominii, commonly known as the Fomin's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and a deep root system that helps it thrive in rocky or well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, arid climates. Campanula fominii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
