    "intro": "Cicer bijugum, commonly known as the two-winged vetch, is a leguminous plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves with two pairs of opposite leaflets, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by lens-shaped pods containing several seeds. Cicer bijugum thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry riverbanks. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
