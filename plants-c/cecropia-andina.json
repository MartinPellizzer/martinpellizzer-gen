    "intro": "Cecropia andina, commonly known as the Andean ceiba, is a fast-growing tree native to the cloud forests of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive, hollow stems that provide habitat for various animals. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with ants, which live in the hollow stems and protect the tree from herbivores. Its rapid growth rate makes it an important component of the ecosystem in its native range. Cecropia andina also plays a role in soil stabilization and contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
