    "intro": "Cratylia nuda, commonly known as the naked cratylia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Cratylia nuda is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. Its growth habit and morphological features make it an interesting subject for botanical study and ecological research."
