    "intro": "Cleistogenes polyphylla, commonly known as the many-flowered bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the central and northern Great Plains of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, compact clumps that form a low-growing sod. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny blue to purple flowers, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow, bluish-green, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Cleistogenes polyphylla is often found in prairie habitats and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
