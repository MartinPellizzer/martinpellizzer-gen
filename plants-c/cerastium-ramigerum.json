    "intro": "Cerastium ramigerum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy, ovate leaves and white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically forms dense mats on the ground, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are often clustered in groups of three to five, and it produces small, rounded fruits that disperse seeds by wind. Cerastium ramigerum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
