    "intro": "Centaurea pugioniformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf star-thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, blue to purple flowers arranged in a compact head. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss. Centaurea pugioniformis is an annual or biennial species, with a short growing season and a reliance on seasonal rainfall."
