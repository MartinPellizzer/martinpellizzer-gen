    "intro": "Cola subglaucescens, commonly known as the African cola tree, is a member of the Sterculiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers. The plant produces hard, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of caffeine. Its botanical features make it distinct from other cola species, particularly in its leaf morphology and fruit structure. The tree thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforest understories."
