    "intro": "Cecropia arbelaezii, commonly known as the Andean ceiba, is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to the highlands of South America. It is a large, deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its buttressed roots and smooth, greyish bark. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and it produces showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a cottony fiber, aiding in wind dispersal. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments and plays an important role in the ecosystems of the Andes."
