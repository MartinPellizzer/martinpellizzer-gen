    "intro": "Centaurea pectinata var. provincialis, commonly known as the Alpine knapweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers surrounded by pale blue to purple bracts. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is often found in higher elevation habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
