    "intro": "Castilleja linariifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, orange, or yellow flowers that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures, relying on host plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in open, sunny areas such as meadows and grasslands. Castilleja linariifolia plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
