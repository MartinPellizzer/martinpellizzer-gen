    "intro": "Campanula quartiniana, commonly known as the Quartini's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
