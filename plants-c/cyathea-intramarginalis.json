    "intro": "Cyathea intramarginalis, commonly known as the Marginal Tree Fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Cyathea intramarginalis plays an important role in the ecological systems of its native habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for various wildlife species."
