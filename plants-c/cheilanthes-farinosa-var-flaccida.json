    "intro": "Cheilanthes farinosa var. flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid rock fern, is a terrestrial fern species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are typically located on the undersides of the fronds. This fern is often found growing on limestone or sandstone substrates, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
