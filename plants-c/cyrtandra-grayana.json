    "intro": "Cyrtandra grayana, commonly known as the Hawaiian bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and streamside areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Cyrtandra grayana is also notable for its role in traditional Hawaiian culture and its ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
