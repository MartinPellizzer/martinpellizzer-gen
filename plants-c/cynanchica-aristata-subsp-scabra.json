    "intro": "Cynanchica aristata subsp. scabra, commonly known as the rough milkvetch, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, opposite leaves with a rough or hairy texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its adaptations to dry environments include deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. It is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
