    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 stagnalis, commonly known as the marsh sedge, is a hybrid plant in the Carex genus, characterized by its grass-like appearance and ability to thrive in wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of green to brown flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Carex \u00d7 stagnalis plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
