    "intro": "Collinsia bartsiifolia var. davidsonii, commonly known as the Davidson's fairy bellflower, is a delicate annual plant native to the coastal regions of California. It features slender, branching stems and produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and lavender. The leaves are narrow and lanceolate, often covered in fine hairs, and the plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It blooms from late spring to early summer, adding a subtle yet charming floral display to its habitat. This variety is closely related to other members of the Collinsia genus, which are known for their ornamental value and ecological importance in native plant communities."
