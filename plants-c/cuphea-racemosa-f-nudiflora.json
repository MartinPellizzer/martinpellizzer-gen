    "intro": "Cuphea racemosa f. nudiflora, commonly known as the naked-flower cuphea, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and Mexico. It belongs to the Lythraceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular, red or pink flowers that bloom in racemes. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and has a compact, bushy growth habit. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. The 'nudiflora' variety is notable for its lack of bracts, giving it a more delicate appearance compared to other cuphea species."
