    "intro": "Cheilanthes hassleri, commonly known as the desert hawksbeard, is a species of fern that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and compact growth habit. The plant has rhizomes that help it survive in harsh, dry conditions by storing moisture and nutrients. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which reduces water loss. Cheilanthes hassleri is often found in rocky soils and is well adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability."
