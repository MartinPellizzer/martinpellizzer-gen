    "intro": "Casearia phegocarpa, commonly known as the red casearia, is a species of flowering plant in the Salicaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive red fruiting structures. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly serrated margin. The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and the plant produces fleshy, red berries that are edible for certain animals but not typically consumed by humans."
