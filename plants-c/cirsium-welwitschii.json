It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, silvery-green leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces showy purple to pink flower heads that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a notable species in its native habitat."
