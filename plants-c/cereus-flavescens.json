    "intro": "Cereus flavescens, commonly known as the yellow torch cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, pale green stems and yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or yellow, which open in the evening and close by morning. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water due to its succulent nature. Cereus flavescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid environments."
