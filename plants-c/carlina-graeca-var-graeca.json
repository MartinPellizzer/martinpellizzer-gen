    "intro": "Carlina graeca var. graeca, commonly known as the Greek carline thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, woolly, violet-blue flower heads that resemble thistles. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often in open landscapes such as grasslands and scrublands. Its leaves are lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces, and the flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets. Carlina graeca var. graeca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
