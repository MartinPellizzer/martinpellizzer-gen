    "intro": "Carex pollens, commonly known as sedges, are flowering plants belonging to the family Cyperaceae. They are characterized by their triangular stems and often produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. The pollen of Carex species is typically light and dry, allowing it to be easily dispersed by the wind. These plants are often found in moist environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. They play an important ecological role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for various insects and small animals."
