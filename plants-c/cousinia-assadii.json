It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cousinia assadii produces small yellow to brown flowers that bloom in the summer months."
