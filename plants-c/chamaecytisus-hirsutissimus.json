    "intro": "Chamaecytisus hirsutissimus, commonly known as the hairy broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the western Mediterranean region. It features wiry, thornless stems covered in dense, soft, grayish-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, pea-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, woody pods. Its leaves are alternate, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall hirsute appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant suitable for rocky or coastal gardens."
