    "intro": "Cyathea brunnea, commonly known as the brown tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is a large, evergreen fern that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery fronds. The plant has a distinctive stipe, or stem, that is covered in a fibrous, spongy material called the rachis. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, displaying a unique ability to emit light in the dark, a trait known as bioluminescence. Cyathea brunnea plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various organisms."
