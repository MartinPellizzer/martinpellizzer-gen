    "intro": "Columnea \u00d7 euphora, commonly known as the hybrid flame vine, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Columnea and Euphorbia species. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often resembling flames. The plant typically grows as a trailing or climbing vine, with succulent-like leaves that are often fleshy and slightly hairy. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This hybrid is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as hummingbirds."
