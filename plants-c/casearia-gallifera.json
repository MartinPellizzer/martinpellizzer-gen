    "intro": "Casearia gallifera, commonly known as the white flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to regions of South America. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in suitable habitats. Casearia gallifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic qualities in warm climates."
