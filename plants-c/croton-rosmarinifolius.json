    "intro": "Croton rosmarinifolius, commonly known as the rosemary-leaved croton, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, aromatic leaves that resemble those of rosemary, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into distinctive, spiky seed capsules. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland tropical forests. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
