    "intro": "Crotalaria montana var. montana, commonly known as the mountain crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant characterized by its erect, branched stems and palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces distinctive yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically borne at the axils of the leaves. Its seeds are enclosed in inflated, pod-like fruits that split open when mature to release the seeds. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
