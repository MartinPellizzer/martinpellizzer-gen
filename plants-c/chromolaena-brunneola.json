    "intro": "Chromolaena brunneola, commonly known as rough chromolaena, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is recognized for its serrated, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white to brown seed heads. Chromolaena brunneola is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
