    "intro": "Calceolaria tripartita subsp. mandoniana, commonly known as the Mandon's slipper orchid, is a member of the Calceolariaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
