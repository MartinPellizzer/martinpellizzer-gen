    "intro": "Cycas xipholepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Madagascar. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cycnophylls, which are specialized leaves that bear the cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Cycas xipholepis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and requiring minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservatories."
