    "intro": "Colysis tridactylis, commonly known as the three-toed fern, is a rare and unique plant species found in specific tropical rainforest habitats. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that split into three distinct lobes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Colysis tridactylis is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
