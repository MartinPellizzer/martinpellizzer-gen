It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and showy, pink to purple flowers that open in the late afternoon. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Calandrinia adenosperma is often found in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun."
