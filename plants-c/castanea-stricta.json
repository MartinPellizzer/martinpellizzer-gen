    "intro": "Castanea stricta, commonly known as the Chinese chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces spiny, cup-like fruits called nuts, which contain one or two edible seeds. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Castanea stricta is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other parts of the world for cultivation."
