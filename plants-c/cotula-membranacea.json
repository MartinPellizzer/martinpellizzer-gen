It is characterized by its delicate, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving them a slightly membranous appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This plant is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is also valued in traditional medicine."
