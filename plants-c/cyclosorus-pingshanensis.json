    "intro": "Cyclosorus pingshanensis, commonly known as the Pingshan cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that form a rosette shape, typically with four to six lobes. The plant is native to China, specifically found in the Pingshan region, where it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its reproductive structures, including small, inconspicuous flowers, are adapted for underwater pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
