    "intro": "Corymbia zygophylla, commonly known as the red gum or red blood tree, is a species of eucalyptus native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive red-brown bark that peels in thin, flaky layers. The tree produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, fibrous texture. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of the local flora."
