It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with a deeply dissected appearance. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its glandular hairs on the leaves and stems are a notable botanical feature, contributing to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations."
