    "intro": "Cordia populifolia, commonly known as the poplar-leaved cordia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a distinctive papery texture with a pale green upper surface. It produces small, fragrant yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, round fruits that split open to release seeds. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
