    "intro": "Couepia magnoliifolia, commonly known as the magnolia-leaf couepia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, fragrant flowers that resemble those of magnolias, hence its common name. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often broad and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink and are borne in clusters at the base of the leaves. Couepia magnoliifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid climates."
