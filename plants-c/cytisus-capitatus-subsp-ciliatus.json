    "intro": "Cytisus capitatus subsp. ciliatus, commonly known as the ciliate broom, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are trifoliate, with three oval to lance-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. This subspecies is notable for its finely ciliate (fringed) margins on the leaves, which distinguish it from other cytisus species."
