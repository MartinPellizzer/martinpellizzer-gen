    "intro": "Carpinus betulus var. quercifolia, commonly known as the European hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, nearly smooth bark that darkens with age, and its alternate, ovate leaves that are often lobed and have a serrated margin. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, spherical fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in hedgerows and urban landscaping due to its hardiness and attractive form. The variety quercifolia is distinguished by its broader, more oak-like leaves compared to the typical hornbeam."
