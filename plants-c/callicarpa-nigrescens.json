    "intro": "Callicarpa nigrescens, commonly known as black beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that mature in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 feet and thrives in partial to full sun with well-drained soil. Its foliage is dark green and aromatic, with a slight medicinal scent. The berries are often used in ornamental landscaping due to their striking color and attractiveness to birds."
