    "intro": "Cypripedium, commonly known as the lady's slipper orchid, is a genus of about 500 species of flowering plants in the orchid family. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, slipper-shaped pouch-like petals that serve as a unique adaptation for pollination. They are typically found in temperate to subalpine regions, often in moist, shaded environments such as forests. Cypripedium species are perennial herbs with fleshy roots and showy flowers that bloom in spring or early summer. Due to their beauty and rarity, many species are threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
