    "intro": "Castanospora, commonly known as the black root fungus, is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Cortinellaceae. These fungi are characterized by their dark, woody stromatic structures that form on the roots of various plants. They are primarily found in forest soils and are often associated with the decay of organic matter. Castanospora species are saprophytic, playing a role in nutrient cycling in ecosystems. Their unique morphology and ecological function make them an important component of soil microbiology."
