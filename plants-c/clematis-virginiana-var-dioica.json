    "intro": "Clematis virginiana var. dioica, commonly known as the Virgin's bower, is a climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with three to seven leaflets and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant is dioecious, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found along stream banks and in thickets. Its berries are edible for birds and contribute to its ecological importance in native habitats."
