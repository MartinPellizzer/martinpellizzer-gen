    "intro": "Cocos nucifera, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is a tall, slender tree that can grow up to 30 meters in height, with pinnate leaves and a distinct crown of fronds. The plant produces large, fibrous fruits called coconuts, which contain both water and a white, fleshy mesocarp. The coconut palm is highly valued for its versatility, providing food, fiber, and oil. Its botanical features make it an important species in tropical agriculture and ecosystems."
