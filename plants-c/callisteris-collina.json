    "intro": "Callisteris collina, commonly known as the desert snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Callisteris collina is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
