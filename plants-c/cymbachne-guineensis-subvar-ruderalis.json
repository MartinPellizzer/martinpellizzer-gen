    "intro": "Cymbachne guineensis subvar. ruderalis, commonly known as the African dandelion, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in abandoned fields, and is characterized by its upright, fibrous stems and basal rosette of narrow leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its spread. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and is often used in traditional medicine. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
