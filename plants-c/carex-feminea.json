It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. Carex feminea thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
