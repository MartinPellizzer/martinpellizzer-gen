It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as grasslands and open woodlands. Its small size and low-growing habit make it well adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for native pollinators."
