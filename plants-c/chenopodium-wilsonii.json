    "intro": "Chenopodium wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's goosefoot, is a flowering plant species native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils such as roadsides and arid environments. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with a rough texture and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds. Chenopodium wilsonii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
