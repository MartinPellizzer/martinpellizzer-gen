    "intro": "Calamagrostis formosana, commonly known as the Chinese silver grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray foliage that turns coppery in the autumn. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stalks that bear small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along stream banks. Calamagrostis formosana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
