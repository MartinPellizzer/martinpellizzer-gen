    "intro": "Cyphokentia samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of Savai'i in Samoa. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and relies on specific insect pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique botanical species."
