    "intro": "Cleisostoma fratrum, commonly known as the \"brother's orchid,\" is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant produces a single, showy bloom that emerges from a leafless stem, often during the rainy season. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, providing a striking contrast to the flowers. Cleisostoma fratrum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
