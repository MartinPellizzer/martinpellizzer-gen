    "intro": "Carduus arvensis var. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered sow thistle, is a variant of the common sow thistle. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features a rosette of spiny, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that are slightly smaller than those of the typical variety. Its white-flowered form is a distinguishing characteristic, setting it apart from other Carduus species. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields and along roadsides."
