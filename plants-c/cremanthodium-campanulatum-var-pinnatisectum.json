    "intro": "Cremanthodium campanulatum var. pinnatisectum, commonly known as the pinnatisected bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a slight purple hue. The plant has finely divided, pinnatisected leaves that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species among botanists."
