    "intro": "Carex clivicola, commonly known as the cliff sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. This plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils along cliffs and slopes, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its slender, grass-like leaves are usually dark green and form dense clumps, while its flowering spikes appear in late spring to early summer. Carex clivicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats."
