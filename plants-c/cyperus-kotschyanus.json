It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. Its slender, grass-like stems are often clustered and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are characteristic of the sedge family."
