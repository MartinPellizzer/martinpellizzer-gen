    "intro": "Clematis rigoi, commonly known as the red-twigged clematis, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its twining stems allow it to climb and trail, making it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. The red stems that emerge in winter add seasonal interest to the landscape."
