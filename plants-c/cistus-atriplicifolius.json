It is characterized by its woody stems and aromatic, hairy leaves that are dark green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal remedies due to their high content of essential oils.
