    "intro": "Cordia patens f. monocephala, commonly known as the single-headed gloryflower, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange, often attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds."
