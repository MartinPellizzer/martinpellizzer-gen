    "intro": "Centaurea aristifera, commonly known as the spiked centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and gravelly soils. Its seed heads are distinctive, with bristly, spiky structures that aid in wind dispersal. Centaurea aristifera is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
