It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom at night. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert environments. Its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming make it a striking addition to botanical gardens and cactus collections."
