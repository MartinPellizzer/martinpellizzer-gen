    "intro": "Cecropia maxima, commonly known as the giant ceiba, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and elongated, light green leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its bark is thick and often has a rough, fissured texture, which helps protect it from herbivores. Cecropia maxima plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various species of birds and insects."
