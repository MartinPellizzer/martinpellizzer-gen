    "intro": "Curnilia sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping curnilia, is a perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with numerous thin, wiry stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Curnilia sarmentosa is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
