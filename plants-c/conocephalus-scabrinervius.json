    "intro": "Conocephalus scabrinervius, commonly known as the rough-veined fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, rough veins, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, elliptical spore-bearing leaves. Conocephalus scabrinervius is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
