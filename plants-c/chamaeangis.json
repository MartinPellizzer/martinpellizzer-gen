    "intro": "Chamaeangis, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage, often forming dense shrubs in rocky or acidic soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring or early summer. Chamaeangis is native to regions with cool, moist climates, such as parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including poor soil and high altitude."
