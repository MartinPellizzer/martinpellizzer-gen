    "intro": "Cynanchum longiflorum, commonly known as the long-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive corolla that has five lobes. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Cynanchum longiflorum is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is noted for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
