It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and unique, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, dry climates and well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and the stems are often covered in a thick layer of fine hairs. Chuquiraga infundibularis is adapted to harsh alpine conditions and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
