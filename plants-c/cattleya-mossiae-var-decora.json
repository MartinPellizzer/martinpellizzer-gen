    "intro": "Cattleya mossiae var. decora, commonly known as the Decorated Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid prized for its striking, large, fragrant flowers. It features velvety petals and a prominent, often brightly colored lip, which is a hallmark of the Cattleya genus. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its native tropical habitats. Its botanical name reflects its origin from crosses between Cattleya mossiae and other related species. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relative ease of cultivation."
