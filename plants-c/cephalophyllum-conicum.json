    "intro": "Cephalophyllum conicum, commonly known as the hooded cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features a distinctive rosette-shaped stem covered in dense, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in spring. Its roots are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
