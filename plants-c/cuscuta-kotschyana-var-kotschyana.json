    "intro": "Cuscuta kotschyana var. kotschyana, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed dispersal by wind or animals. The plant forms a dense network of yellow, thread-like stems that wrap around its host, extracting water and nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and parts of Mexico. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and native vegetation."
