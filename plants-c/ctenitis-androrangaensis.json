    "intro": "Ctenitis androrangaensis, commonly known as the Madagascar tree fern, is a species native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern, with a thick, fibrous root system that helps it anchor in the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. This fern is an important component of the rainforest ecosystem, providing habitat and contributing to biodiversity."
