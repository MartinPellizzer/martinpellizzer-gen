    "intro": "Centaurium chloodes subsp. somedanum, commonly known as the Soredanum centaury, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, bright red flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late summer to early autumn. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique floral structure and habitat preferences compared to other members of the Centaurium genus."
