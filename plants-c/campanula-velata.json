    "intro": "Campanula velata, commonly known as the veiled bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically blue to purple in color. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The plant's ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
