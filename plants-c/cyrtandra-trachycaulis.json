It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often clustered in inflorescences. Cyrtandra trachycaulis thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and is often found in Hawaii and other parts of Oceania.
