    "intro": "Colchicum autumnale subsp. graecum, commonly known as the Greek autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean. It features striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive red or orange stigma, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that emerge from a bulbous corm, which serves as its primary storage organ. It is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain colchicine, a potent alkaloid."
