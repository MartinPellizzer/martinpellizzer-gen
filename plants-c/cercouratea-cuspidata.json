    "intro": "Cercouratea cuspidata, commonly known as the sharp-pointed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and have a finely serrated edge. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across moist soil. Cercouratea cuspidata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
