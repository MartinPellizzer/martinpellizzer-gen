    "intro": "Chrysodium sorbifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf sorb, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are broadly ovate and have a distinctive waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Chrysodium sorbifolium is often cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and aesthetic value."
