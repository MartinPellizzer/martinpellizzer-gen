    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha var. lagenariformis, commonly known as the large-fruited hawthorn, is a variant of the hawthorn species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its large, oval-shaped fruits that are typically red or orange when ripe. The plant produces white or pink flowers in spring, which are followed by the showy, berry-like fruits in late summer. Its leaves are typically elliptical with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in woodland areas or along hedgerows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
