    "intro": "Corchorus tomentosus, commonly known as silky bursage, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
