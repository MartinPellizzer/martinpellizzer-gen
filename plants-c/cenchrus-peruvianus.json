    "intro": "Cenchrus peruvianus, commonly known as the Peruvian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, bristly florets. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry climates. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cenchrus peruvianus is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
