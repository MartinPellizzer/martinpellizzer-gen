    "intro": "Cyclophorus acrostichoides, commonly known as the broadleaf cyclophorus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, where it thrives in wetland and swampy environments. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically broad and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in the spring. The plant is often found in association with other wetland flora and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
