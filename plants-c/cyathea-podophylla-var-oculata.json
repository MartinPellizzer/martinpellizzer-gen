    "intro": "Cyathea podophylla var. oculata, commonly known as the eye-leaf tree fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds have a distinctive appearance with a central rib and lateral pinnae that often have a waxy, glossy texture. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in dense, spore-bearing structures called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks."
