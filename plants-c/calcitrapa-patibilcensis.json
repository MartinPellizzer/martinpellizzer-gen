    "intro": "Calcitrapa patibilcensis, commonly known as the fragile rock aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, pale blue to violet flowers in the summer months. The plant is adapted to harsh, rocky environments and has a deep root system to access scarce moisture. It is often found in alpine meadows and is a member of the Asteraceae family. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
