    "intro": "Ceanothus huichagorare, commonly known as the Huichol ceanothus, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to dry climates, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
