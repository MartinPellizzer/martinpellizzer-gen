    "intro": "Coffea opulina, commonly known as the African coffee tree, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in panicles, while the fruit is a red, fleshy berry containing two seeds. Coffea opulina is not widely cultivated for coffee production due to its low yield and the presence of toxic compounds in its seeds."
