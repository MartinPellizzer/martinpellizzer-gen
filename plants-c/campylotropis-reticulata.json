It features compound leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern, and its small, pea-like flowers are typically pink or purple. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in grasslands and rocky areas, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
