It belongs to the Elaeocarpaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, oval-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Celtis rostrata typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to tolerate urban conditions."
