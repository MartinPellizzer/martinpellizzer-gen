    "intro": "Centaurea lappacea, commonly known as the western coneflower, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flower heads, which are surrounded by bracts that resemble a crown. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It produces small, spiky seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Centaurea lappacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
