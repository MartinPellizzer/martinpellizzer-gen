    "intro": "Cuscuta mitriformis, commonly known as the hooded dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed dispersal and germination on suitable hosts. The plant's stem is covered in tiny, adhesive structures that allow it to attach to and extract nutrients from its host. It is native to regions of North America and is often found on plants such as milkweed and other flowering species. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
