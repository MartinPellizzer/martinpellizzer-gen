It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and wet meadows, and prefers full to partial sunlight. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, consist of small, clustered flowers that are wind-pollinated. Carex sartwellii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
