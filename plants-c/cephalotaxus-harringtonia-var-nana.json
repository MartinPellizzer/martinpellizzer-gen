    "intro": "Cephalotaxus harringtonia var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf Chinese yew, is a compact evergreen shrub native to China. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are dark green and retain their color year-round. The plant produces small, reddish-pink flowers followed by blue-black berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a foundation plant. Its slow growth rate and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for landscape design."
