    "intro": "Cereus kalbreyerianus, commonly known as the Kalbreyer's candleplant, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a trait common among many cacti adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss and provide protection from herbivores. The plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in dry climates."
