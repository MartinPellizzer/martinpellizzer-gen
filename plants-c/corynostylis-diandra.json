    "intro": "Corynostylis diandra, commonly known as the narrow-leafed lily or the narrow-leaved corynostylis, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that are clustered in spikes, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understoreys. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
