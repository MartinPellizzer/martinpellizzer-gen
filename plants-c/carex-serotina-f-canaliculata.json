    "intro": "Carex serotina f. canaliculata, commonly known as the late-flowering sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The subspecies canaliculata is distinguished by its distinctive, deep grooves on the leaf sheaths."
