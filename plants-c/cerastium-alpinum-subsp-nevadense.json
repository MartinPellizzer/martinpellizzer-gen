    "intro": "Cerastium alpinum subsp. nevadense, commonly known as the Sierra mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically forms dense mats of hairy, succulent foliage that help it retain moisture in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It is adapted to rocky soils and high elevations, often found in meadows and talus slopes. Its subspecific name, *nevadense*, refers to its distribution in the Sierra Nevada range."
