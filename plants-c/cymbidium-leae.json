    "intro": "Cymbidium leae, commonly known as the leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its growth habit is sympodial, meaning it grows horizontally along the ground with new shoots emerging from the base. Cymbidium leae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
