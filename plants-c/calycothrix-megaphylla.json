    "intro": "Calycothrix megaphylla, commonly known as the giant leaf fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, broad fronds that can reach several feet in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce both roots and new fronds. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Calycothrix megaphylla is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas."
