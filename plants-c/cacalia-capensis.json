    "intro": "Cacalia capensis, commonly known as the Cape bellflower, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. Its showy blue or purple flowers bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cacalia capensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
