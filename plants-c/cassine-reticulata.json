    "intro": "Cassine reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined cassine, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often heart-shaped leaves with a distinct net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that are typically followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Cassine reticulata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
