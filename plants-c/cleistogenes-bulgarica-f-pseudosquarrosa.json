It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of short, stiff hairs on its stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer, which are enclosed within bracts. This subspecies is notable for its adaptation to arid conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
