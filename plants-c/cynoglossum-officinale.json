    "intro": "Cynoglossum officinale, commonly known as hound's tongue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features distinctive, broad, tongue-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous, and it can spread through both seeds and rhizomes. While it has ornamental value, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native flora."
