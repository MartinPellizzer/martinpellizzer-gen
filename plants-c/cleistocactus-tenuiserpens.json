    "intro": "Cleistocactus tenuiserpens, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are often covered in a fine, white coating. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
