    "intro": "Callisemaea, commonly known as the sticky monkeyflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Geraniaceae. It is native to western North America, particularly found in California and adjacent regions. The plants are characterized by their sticky, glandular hairs that cover the leaves and stems, giving them a distinctive appearance. They typically grow in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Callisemaea species produce showy flowers that are often pink or purple, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
