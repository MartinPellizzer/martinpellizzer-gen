    "intro": "Colletia armata f. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth colletia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss. The subspecies 'subglabra' distinguishes itself by having a smoother stem surface compared to other forms of Colletia armata."
