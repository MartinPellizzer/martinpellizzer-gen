    "intro": "Conyza ericoides, commonly known as coastal cudweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is an annual herb that typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils along shorelines. The plant has small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are usually hairy and lance-shaped. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in saline environments, making it a common sight in coastal dunes and marshes. Conyza ericoides plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
