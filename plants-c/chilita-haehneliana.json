    "intro": "Chilita haehneliana, commonly known as the Hahnel's chilita, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
