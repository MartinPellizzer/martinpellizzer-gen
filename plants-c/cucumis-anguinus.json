    "intro": "Cucumis anguinus, commonly known as the horned cucumber, is a unique member of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive spiky, horn-like projections along its ridged, elongated fruit. Native to the Mediterranean region, this plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil. The fruit is typically harvested when it is still green, though it can be eaten when mature. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and culinary experimentation."
