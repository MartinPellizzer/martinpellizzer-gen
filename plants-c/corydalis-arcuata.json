    "intro": "Corydalis arcuata, commonly known as the bentstem fumitory, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and clusters of small, delicate flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Corydalis arcuata is often found in woodland habitats and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in shaded environments."
