    "intro": "Cussonia calophylla, commonly known as the African arrowroot, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, making it drought-tolerant. The plant has broad, glossy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in umbels, and it produces berries that are edible but not widely consumed. Cussonia calophylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal in landscaping due to its robust growth and attractive foliage."
