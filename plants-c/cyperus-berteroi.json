    "intro": "Cyperus berteroi, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its slender, grass-like stems are usually less than 1 meter tall, with narrow, linear leaves. Cyperus berteroi produces small, three-ranked spikelets that are often hidden among the foliage, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
