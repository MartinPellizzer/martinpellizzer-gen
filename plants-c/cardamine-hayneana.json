    "intro": "Cardamine hayneana, commonly known as Hayne's buttercup, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is a small herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces delicate yellow flowers with five sepals and numerous stamens. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in regions with rich, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
