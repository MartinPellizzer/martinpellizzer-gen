It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has alternate leaves that are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silky texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
