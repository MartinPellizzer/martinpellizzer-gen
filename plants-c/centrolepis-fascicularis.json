It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit with dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental plant in arid or coastal gardens."
