    "intro": "Calligonum patens subsp. pamiroalaicum, commonly known as the Pamir sandthrift, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to sandy and rocky soils, often found in desert margins and mountainous areas. This subspecies is notable for its resilience to drought and extreme temperatures, making it a valuable plant for stabilizing soil in arid landscapes."
