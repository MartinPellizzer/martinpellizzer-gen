It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is known for its long-lasting blooms, which remain intact even when dried, making it popular in floral arrangements. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Craspedia alpina is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant in cooler regions."
