    "intro": "Cormigonus portlandiodes, commonly known as the Portland corm, is a unique plant characterized by its underground corm, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from the base of the corm. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
