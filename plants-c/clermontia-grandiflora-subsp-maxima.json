    "intro": "Clermontia grandiflora subsp. maxima, commonly known as the Hawaiian mountain mint, is a perennial herb native to the island of Hawaii. It is characterized by its aromatic, hairy leaves and showy, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in terminal clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforest understories and along stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
