    "intro": "Chaunochiton kappleri, commonly known as the Pacific sea snail, is a species of gastropod mollusk in the family Chaunochitonidae. It is characterized by its elongated, conical shell that is typically pale in color with a glossy surface. Native to the coastal waters of the Pacific Ocean, this species thrives in intertidal zones and rocky substrates. The shell provides protection against predation and environmental stress. Its anatomy includes a muscular foot used for locomotion and a radula for feeding on algae and detritus."
