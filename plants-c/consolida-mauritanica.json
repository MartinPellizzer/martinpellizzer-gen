    "intro": "Consolida mauritanica, commonly known as the desert smokeflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and related species. The plant is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of small, delicate, pink or white flowers that resemble those of the common poppy. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Consolida mauritanica is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
