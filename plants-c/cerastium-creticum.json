    "intro": "Cerastium creticum, commonly known as the Cretan chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a mat-forming habit with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and sandy soils. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Cerastium creticum is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions."
