    "intro": "Carduus occidentalis var. coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's thistle, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and chaparral habitats. Its foliage and flowers are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
