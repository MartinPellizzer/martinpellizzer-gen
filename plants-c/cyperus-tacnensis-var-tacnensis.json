    "intro": "Cyperus tacnensis var. tacnensis, commonly known as the Tacna flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to South America, particularly Peru. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native regions."
