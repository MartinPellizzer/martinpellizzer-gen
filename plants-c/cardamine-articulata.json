    "intro": "Cardamine articulata, commonly known as the articulated watercress, is a perennial herb native to wetlands and stream banks in North America. It has slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground, and its leaves are alternate, with a distinctive lobed or divided structure. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery taste similar to watercress, making it a valued plant in some culinary traditions. However, it is often considered invasive in certain regions due to its rapid spread in moist environments."
