    "intro": "Collinsonia anisata, commonly known as the sweet pepper plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a fleshy, red or orange berry that ripens in late summer, containing several seeds. The plant is often grown for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
