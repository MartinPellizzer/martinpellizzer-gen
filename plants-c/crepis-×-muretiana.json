    "intro": "Crepis \u00d7 muretiana, commonly known as the hybrid wallflower, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves, which help it thrive in rocky or disturbed habitats. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white to pink petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often found in temperate regions of Europe and is adapted to grow in poor soils. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
