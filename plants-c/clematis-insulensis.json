It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets and produces showy, blue-violet flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its vigorous growth habit requires support structures, and it is often used in ornamental landscaping.
