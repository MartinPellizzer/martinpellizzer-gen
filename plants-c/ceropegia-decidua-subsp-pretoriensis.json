    "intro": "Ceropegia decidua subsp. pretoriensis, commonly known as the Pretoria milkweed, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, sometimes hairy leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often pale green or yellowish, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insects. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. This subspecies is noted for its resilience and ability to survive in harsh, semi-desert conditions."
