    "intro": "Calanthe tokunoshimensis f. latilabella, commonly known as the broad-labellum calanthe, is a rare orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and striking, showy flowers with a broad, intricate labellum. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive, spurred lip that aids in pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
