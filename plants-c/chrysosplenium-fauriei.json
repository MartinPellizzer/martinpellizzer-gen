    "intro": "Chrysosplenium fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's golden spleenwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Saxifragaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and features small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and early summer, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
