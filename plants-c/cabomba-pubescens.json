    "intro": "Cabomba pubescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to the Americas. It has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically in late summer. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, it can become invasive in certain regions."
