    "intro": "Colletia infausta var. coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved colletia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems and small, clustered flowers that range from yellow to orange in color. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. It produces showy, often tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
