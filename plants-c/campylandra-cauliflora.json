    "intro": "Campylandra cauliflora, commonly known as the red-flowered campylandra, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or pink flowers that bloom in dense clusters along the stems, a feature known as cauliflory. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Campylandra cauliflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
