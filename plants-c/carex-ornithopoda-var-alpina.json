It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known for their fibrous root systems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous environments, often forming dense clumps. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces three-sided, triangular seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude habitats."
