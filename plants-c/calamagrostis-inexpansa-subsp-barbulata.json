    "intro": "Calamagrostis inexpansa subsp. barbulata, commonly known as the silky blue grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and delicate, feathery inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for water gardens and naturalized landscapes. The subspecies barbulata is distinguished by its longer, more silky hairs on the leaves compared to the typical form of C. inexpansa."
