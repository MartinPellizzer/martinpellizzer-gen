    "intro": "Corethrostylis schulzenii, commonly known as the Purple Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Australia. It is characterized by its vivid purple petals and a distinctive, narrow, erect stem. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understoreys. Its flowers are small but highly ornamental, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
