    "intro": "Cassine rehmannii, commonly known as the satinwood or rehmann's satinwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lythraceae. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly found in wetland areas and along stream banks. The plant is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and showy, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Cassine rehmannii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
