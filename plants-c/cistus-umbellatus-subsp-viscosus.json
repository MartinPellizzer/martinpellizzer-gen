    "intro": "Cistus umbellatus subsp. viscosus, commonly known as sticky rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage covered in a sticky resin, which gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant yellow or orange flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its resinous leaves and flowers have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
