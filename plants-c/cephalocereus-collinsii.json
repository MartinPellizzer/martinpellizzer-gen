    "intro": "Cephalocereus collinsii, commonly known as the night bloomer cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and sparse, spiny foliage. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its succulent stems store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Cephalocereus collinsii is often cultivated for its striking appearance and unique blooming habits."
