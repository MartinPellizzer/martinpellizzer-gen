    "intro": "Chenopodium ambrosioides f. dentatum, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, toothed, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its seeds are typically dispersed by wind. Native to North America, it thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in various habitats such as roadsides and fields. It is sometimes considered a weed but has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
