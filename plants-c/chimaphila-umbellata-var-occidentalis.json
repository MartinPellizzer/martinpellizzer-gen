    "intro": "Chimaphila umbellata var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western starflower, is a low-growing evergreen perennial shrub native to the western United States. It features dense clusters of star-shaped, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves with a waxy coating, which help it retain moisture in its often dry habitat. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
