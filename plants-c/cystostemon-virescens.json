    "intro": "Cystostemon virescens, commonly known as the green-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Cystostemon virescens is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid forest environments."
