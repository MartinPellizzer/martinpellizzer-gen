    "intro": "Carex stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are usually wind-pollinated. Carex stenophylla is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
