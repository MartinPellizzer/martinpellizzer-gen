    "intro": "Corytoplectus, commonly known as the sea hare, is a genus of marine gastropod mollusks belonging to the family Aplysiidae. These creatures are characterized by their soft, gelatinous bodies and often vibrant coloration, which can serve as a form of camouflage or warning to predators. They are found in various coastal and deep-sea environments, primarily in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Corytoplectus species are herbivorous, feeding on algae and other plant matter, contributing to the ecological balance of their habitats. Their anatomy includes a radula for scraping food and a muscular foot for movement, reflecting their adaptation to aquatic life."
