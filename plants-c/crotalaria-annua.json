    "intro": "Crotalaria annua, commonly known as yellow cowpea, is an annual herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain toxic seeds, which can be harmful to livestock. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as fields and roadsides. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful forage crop and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
