    "intro": "Corymbia pocillum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a waxy coating. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by hard, fibrous fruits. This plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of native Australian flora."
