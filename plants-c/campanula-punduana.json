    "intro": "Campanula punduana, commonly known as the Punduana bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Campanula punduana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in gardens with proper drainage."
