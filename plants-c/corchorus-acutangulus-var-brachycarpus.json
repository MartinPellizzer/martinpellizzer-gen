    "intro": "Corchorus acutangulus var. brachycarpus, commonly known as the short-seed dock, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by distinctive, triangular, and short-stemmed seed pods. Its fibrous stems and leaves make it a source of natural fibers, historically used in textile production. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks."
