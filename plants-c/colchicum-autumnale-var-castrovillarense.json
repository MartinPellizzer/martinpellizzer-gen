It is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers with white markings, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and appear after the flowers, often in late spring. This species is notable for containing toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested."
