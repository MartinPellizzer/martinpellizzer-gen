It is characterized by its hairy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a creeping growth habit with woody stems that can root at the nodes. Its leaves are alternate, serrated, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Cnicus gossypinus is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
