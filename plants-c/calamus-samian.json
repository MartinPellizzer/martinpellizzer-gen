    "intro": "Calamus samian, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas in Asia and the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Poaceae, although it is often classified under the Acoraceae family due to its unique characteristics. The plant has long, slender rhizomes that are aromatic and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in dense clumps near water. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in early summer."
