    "intro": "Croton astianus, commonly known as the flame tree or fire tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange floral bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically large, ovate, and have a rough texture with a slightly serrated edge. Croton astianus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical and subtropical gardens."
