    "intro": "Clerodendrum splendens var. splendens, commonly known as the flame bush or red flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble clusters of small red flowers, which are actually clusters of tiny, tubular blooms. The plant produces small, green, egg-shaped fruits that turn red when mature, containing seeds surrounded by a fleshy, edible aril. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a landscape plant. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, contributing to its overall aesthetic appeal."
