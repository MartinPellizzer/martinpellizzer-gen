    "intro": "Campanula secundiflora, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or violet. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it blooms from late spring to early summer. Campanula secundiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
