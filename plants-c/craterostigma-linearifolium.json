    "intro": "Craterostigma linearifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rockcress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a small, perennial herb characterized by its slender, upright stems and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its drought tolerance and unique morphology, it is of interest in both ecological and horticultural studies."
