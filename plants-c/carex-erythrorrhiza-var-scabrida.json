    "intro": "Carex erythrorrhiza var. scabrida, commonly known as the scarlet sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces spikes of reddish-brown flowers, which are typically arranged in a dense, cylindrical inflorescence. The plant thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. The varietal name *scabrida* refers to the rough, scaly texture of its leaves, distinguishing it from other Carex species."
