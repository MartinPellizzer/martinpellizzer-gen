    "intro": "Craibiodendron, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. These plants are characterized by their showy, velvety flowers that come in a wide range of colors. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Craibiodendron species are often cultivated as houseplants due to their attractive appearance and ease of care. They thrive in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
