    "intro": "Clusia nervosa, commonly known as the waxleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Clusia nervosa is also valued for its ability to tolerate shade and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy and adaptable plant."
