    "intro": "Croton moonii, commonly known as the moonleaf croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that can be green, red, or variegated, depending on the variety. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
