    "intro": "Cicca geraesensis, commonly known as the Geraes Mountain cicca, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the mountainous regions of South America. It is a small shrub characterized by its woody stems and lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the unique microclimates of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cicca geraesensis is considered a vulnerable species."
