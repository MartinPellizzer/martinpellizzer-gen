It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique adaptations to calcareous environments. The plant typically features slender, hairy stems and small, delicate flowers with a distinct coloration. It thrives in rocky or crevice habitats, often in arid or semi-arid climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
