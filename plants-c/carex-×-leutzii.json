    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 leutzii, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex breviculmis and Carex micromera. This plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
