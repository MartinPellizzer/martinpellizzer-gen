    "intro": "Cyrtopera trilamellata, commonly known as the three-lobed fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, trifoliate fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
