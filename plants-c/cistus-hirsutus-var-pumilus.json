    "intro": "Cistus hirsutus var. pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with small, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces fragrant, pink to reddish-purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant for coastal and dry landscapes. Its aromatic oils have been used historically in perfumery and traditional medicine."
