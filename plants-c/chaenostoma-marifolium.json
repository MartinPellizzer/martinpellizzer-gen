    "intro": "Chaenostoma marifolium, commonly known as the marsh thimbleweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in a dense, spherical inflorescence called a corymb. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in water-saturated soils. Chaenostoma marifolium plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
