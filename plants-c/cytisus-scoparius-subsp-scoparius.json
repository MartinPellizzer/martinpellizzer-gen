    "intro": "Cytisus scoparius subsp. scoparius, commonly known as goat's rue, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are small, pinnate, and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, scrublands, and coastal areas. This subspecies is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites, making it both a useful pioneer species and a potential weed."
