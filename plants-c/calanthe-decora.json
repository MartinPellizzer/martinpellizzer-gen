    "intro": "Calanthe decora, commonly known as the decorated calanthe, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and intricate, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant prefers cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its flowers are usually pink or white with distinctive markings, and it produces small, round pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Calanthe decora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
