    "intro": "Clematis stronachii, commonly known as the Stronach's Clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically white or pale blue, appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, woody berries that contain the seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun to partial shade. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to climb trellises or walls."
