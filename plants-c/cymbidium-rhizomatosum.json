    "intro": "Cymbidium rhizomatosum, commonly known as the rhizomatous orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense clusters. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of fragrant, lance-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and often have a waxy coating. Cymbidium rhizomatosum is appreciated for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a potted plant."
