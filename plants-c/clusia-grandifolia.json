    "intro": "Clusia grandifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, dark green leaves that are often variegated with yellow or white markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by orange or red berries. It is well adapted to humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Clusia grandifolia is also valued for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its tolerance to urban environments."
