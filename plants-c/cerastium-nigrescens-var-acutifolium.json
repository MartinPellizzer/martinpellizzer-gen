    "intro": "Cerastium nigrescens var. acutifolium, commonly known as the sharp-leaved mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
