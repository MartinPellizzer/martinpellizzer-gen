    "intro": "Cyclanthera grisebachii var. ovata, commonly known as the oval cucumber gourd, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It produces large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and has distinctive, elongated fruits that are typically green and covered in soft spines. The plant belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers, melons, and squash. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female blooms, and it relies on insect pollination for reproduction. The fruit is edible when mature, though it is less commonly cultivated compared to other members of its family."
