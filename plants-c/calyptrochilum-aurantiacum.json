It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that range from orange to red, with a distinctive lip that is often more vividly colored than the rest of the flower. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as under the canopy of rainforests. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Calyptrochilum aurantiacum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
