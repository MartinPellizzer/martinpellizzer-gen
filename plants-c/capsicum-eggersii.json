    "intro": "Capsicum eggersii, commonly known as the Eggers' pepper, is a rare and lesser-known species of chili pepper native to Mexico. It is characterized by its small, elongated fruits that typically range in color from yellow to orange when mature. The plant is an annual herb with hairy stems and lobed leaves, typical of many Capsicum species. It thrives in warm, dry climates and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
