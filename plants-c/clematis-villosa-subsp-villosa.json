    "intro": "Clematis villosa subsp. villosa, commonly known as the silky clematis, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often covered in a fine, silvery down that gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of white, pink, or blue. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Its vigorous growth habit requires support, such as trellises or fences, for optimal display."
