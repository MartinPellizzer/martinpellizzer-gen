    "intro": "Cyphia volubilis var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed cyphia, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features thin, wiry stems that can grow up to several meters in length, allowing it to twine around other plants or structures. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its visual appeal."
