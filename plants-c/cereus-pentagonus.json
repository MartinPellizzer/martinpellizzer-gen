It is a spiny, columnar cactus that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features a tall, cylindrical stem with distinct, angular ridges that give it its common name. Its flowers are large, white, and bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Cereus pentagonus is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements."
