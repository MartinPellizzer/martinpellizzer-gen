    "intro": "Cantleya, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their bell-shaped flowers, which range in color from white to pink and violet. Cantleya species typically grow from rhizomes and have a low, mat-like growth habit. They are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
