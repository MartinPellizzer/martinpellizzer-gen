    "intro": "Crantzia ichthyoderma, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to coastal areas of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features striking blue to purple ray florets surrounded by yellow disk florets, making it visually distinctive. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Crantzia ichthyoderma is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate saline conditions."
