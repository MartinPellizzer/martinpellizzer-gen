    "intro": "Cymothoe cyclophylla, commonly known as the cyclophylla swallowtail, is a species of butterfly found in Africa. It belongs to the family Nymphalidae and is characterized by its striking wing patterns. The plant it interacts with, primarily the leaves of the plantain lily (Xanthosoma), serves as its larval food source. The butterfly's life cycle involves laying eggs on the leaves, which are then consumed by the caterpillars. Its presence in ecosystems highlights the intricate relationships between flora and fauna in tropical regions."
