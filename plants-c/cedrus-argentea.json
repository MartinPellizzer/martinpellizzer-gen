    "intro": "Cedrus argentea, commonly known as the silver cedar, is a species of coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and its distinctive silvery-blue foliage, which gives it its common name. The leaves are scale-like and tightly packed, contributing to the tree's dense, compact appearance. It produces small, oval cones that contain seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. This plant is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and can thrive in full sun."
