    "intro": "Calamagrostis arundinacea var. contracta, commonly known as narrowleaf giant reed, is a compact, ornamental grass native to Europe and Asia. It features slender, dark green leaves that are narrower than those of the standard variety, giving it a refined appearance. The plant produces tall, showy panicles of silver-green to golden florets in late summer, adding visual interest to gardens. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for landscaping. Its dense growth habit also makes it suitable for erosion control and as a screen plant."
