    "intro": "Cycas riedlei, commonly known as the Socotra cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and its large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cone-like structures, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being ovoid. Cycas riedlei is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for hundreds of years. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN."
