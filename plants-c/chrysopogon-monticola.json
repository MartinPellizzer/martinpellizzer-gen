It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils. Chrysopogon monticola plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine and mountainous regions."
