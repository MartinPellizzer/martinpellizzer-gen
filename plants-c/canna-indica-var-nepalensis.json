    "intro": "Canna indica var. nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal canna, is a striking ornamental plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, often with a reddish or purple underside. The plant produces showy, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by colorful, petal-like bracts, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for water gardens and tropical landscapes. Its robust growth and vibrant foliage make it a valuable addition to botanical collections and ornamental horticulture."
