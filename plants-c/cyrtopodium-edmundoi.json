    "intro": "Cyrtopodium edmundoi, commonly known as the Edmund's corydalis, is a rare orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically blooms during the warmer months, and its roots are adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Cyrtopodium edmundoi is known for its delicate foliage and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
