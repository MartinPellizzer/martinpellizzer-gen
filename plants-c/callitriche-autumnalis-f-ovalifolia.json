    "intro": "Callitriche autumnalis f. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaved water starwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Hydrocharitaceae family. It is characterized by its small, floating or submerged leaves that are typically oval in shape, giving it its specific epithet. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
