    "intro": "Calyptrogyne deneversii, commonly known as the West Indian mangrove, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in brackish or saltwater environments, such as mangrove swamps. The plant has adaptive features, including specialized roots that help it survive in waterlogged soils. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Calyptrogyne deneversii plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
