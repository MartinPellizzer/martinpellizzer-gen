    "intro": "Crupina alpestris, commonly known as alpine crupina, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes. The plant features erect, branching stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, blue to purple flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Crupina alpestris is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra-like habitats."
