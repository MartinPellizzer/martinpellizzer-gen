    "intro": "Cousinia sporadocephala, commonly known as the woolly cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cousinia sporadocephala is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
