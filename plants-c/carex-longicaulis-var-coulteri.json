    "intro": "Carex longicaulis var. coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's sedge, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in woodland or riparian habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade. Its botanical features make it a suitable choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
