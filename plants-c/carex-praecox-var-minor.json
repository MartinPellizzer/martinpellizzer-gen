    "intro": "Carex praecox var. minor, commonly known as early sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and densely packed, forming a dense mat. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, greenish-yellow flowers that mature into spikelets. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
