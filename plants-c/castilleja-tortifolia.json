    "intro": "Castilleja tortifolia, commonly known as the twistedleaf milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants."
