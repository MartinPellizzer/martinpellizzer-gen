    "intro": "Castilleja dissitiflora, commonly known as the scattered-flower Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb water and nutrients from host plants, primarily grasses and shrubs. Its flowers are arranged in dense spikes and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. Castilleja dissitiflora plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
