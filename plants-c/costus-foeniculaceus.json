    "intro": "Costus foeniculaceus, commonly known as the sweet sedge, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. It is a perennial herb with tall, cylindrical stems that often grow in wet or marshy environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in spike-like clusters. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. The plant is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to wet conditions."
