    "intro": "Cynometra mimosoides, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Caesalpiniaceae and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that resemble those of the mimosoid legumes. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood used in furniture and construction, and it also has traditional medicinal uses. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
