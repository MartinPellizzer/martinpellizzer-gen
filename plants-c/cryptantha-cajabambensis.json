    "intro": "Cryptantha cajabambensis, commonly known as the Cajabamba cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Peru. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
