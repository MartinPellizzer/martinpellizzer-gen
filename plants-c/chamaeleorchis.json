    "intro": "Chamaeleorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them, instead relying on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern. Due to habitat destruction and climate change, Chamaeleorchis faces significant threats to its survival."
