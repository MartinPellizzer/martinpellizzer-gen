    "intro": "Ceramanthe, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. The plants are typically herbaceous, with slender stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. Ceramanthe species often thrive in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to dry, sunny environments. Their flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and they are valued for their ornamental appeal in gardens."
