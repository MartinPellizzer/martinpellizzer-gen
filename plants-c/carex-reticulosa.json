    "intro": "Carex reticulosa, commonly known as the netleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces distinctive, three-angled seed capsules. Carex reticulosa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse ecosystems."
