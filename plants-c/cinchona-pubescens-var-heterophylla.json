    "intro": "Cinchona pubescens var. heterophylla, commonly known as the Andean quina or yellow quina, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru, where it grows in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its yellow flowers and elliptical leaves with a rough, hairy texture. It is closely related to other cinchona species, which are the source of quinine, a compound used in malaria treatment. Due to its ecological and medicinal significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
