    "intro": "Cerasus laurocerasus var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf cherry laurel, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, dark green, glossy leaves that are elliptical in shape and provide dense foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in spring, which are followed by dark red berries. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for use as a hedging plant or ornamental specimen. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, requiring minimal maintenance once established."
