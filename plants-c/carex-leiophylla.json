    "intro": "Carex leiophylla, commonly known as the smooth-leaf sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, consist of small, greenish-brown flowers that are wind-pollinated. Carex leiophylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
