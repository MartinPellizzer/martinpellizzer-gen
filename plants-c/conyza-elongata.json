    "intro": "Conyza elongata, commonly known as slenderleaf fleabane, is an annual flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as fields and roadsides, thriving in dry to mesic conditions. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Conyza elongata is often found in the western and central United States, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
