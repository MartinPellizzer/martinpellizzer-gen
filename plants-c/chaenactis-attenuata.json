    "intro": "Chaenactis attenuata, commonly known as the slender rayless goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and gravelly soils. Its flowers are small and yellow, often lacking ray florets, and bloom in late spring to early summer. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
