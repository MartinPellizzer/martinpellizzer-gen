    "intro": "Cobaea, commonly known as the angel's trumpets, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Solanaceae. These plants are native to South America and are characterized by their large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in various colors such as white, yellow, and purple. The leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, and the plant can grow as a shrub or a vine depending on the species. Cobaea species are often cultivated for their ornamental value, though some contain toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
