    "intro": "Coryphopteris didymochlaenoides, commonly known as the two-veined hartiya, is a fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive two-veined structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under forest canopies, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect light. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
