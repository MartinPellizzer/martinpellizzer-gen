    "intro": "Craterostigma lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky soils. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Craterostigma lanceolatum is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments, showcasing features like deep root systems and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss."
