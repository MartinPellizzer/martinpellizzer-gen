    "intro": "Carduus butaguensis, commonly known as the Bolivian thistle, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Bolivia, and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has a taproot system and produces achenes as its fruit, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
