    "intro": "Carex liparocarpos f. conglobata, commonly known as the globular sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and cylindrical, often reddish-brown stems. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of inconspicuous flowers, typical of sedges, which are usually wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. This subspecies is typically found in wet or moist habitats, such as marshes and wetlands, where it thrives in poorly drained soils."
