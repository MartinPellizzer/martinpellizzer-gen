It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by orange to red, fleshy fruits that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. Cordia zeyheri is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local communities."
