    "intro": "Cyclosorus xunwuensis, commonly known as the Xunwu water fern, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores into the water, facilitating its propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
