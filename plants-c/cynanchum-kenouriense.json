    "intro": "Cynanchum kenouriense, commonly known as Kenor's milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its milky sap, which is a common feature among the genus Cynanchum. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine, though the plant is generally considered toxic due to the presence of cardiac glycosides."
