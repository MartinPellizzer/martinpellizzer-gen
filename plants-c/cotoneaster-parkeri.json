    "intro": "Cotoneaster parkeri, commonly known as the Sierra Madre cotoneaster, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Cotoneaster parkeri is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
