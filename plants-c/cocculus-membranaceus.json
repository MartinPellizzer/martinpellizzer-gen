It is a climbing vine that produces small, greenish-white flowers and edible fruits that resemble cucumbers. The plant belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. The fruit is typically harvested when immature and used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
