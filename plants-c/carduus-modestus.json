    "intro": "Carduus modestus, commonly known as the common thistle, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and it thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple or pink flowers, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in dry conditions and is often used in traditional medicine. Carduus modestus is also an important food source for certain insects and birds."
