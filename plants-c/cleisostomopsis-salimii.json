    "intro": "Cleisostomopsis salimii, commonly known as the Salimii's cleistostomopsis, is a rare flowering plant belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and features small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive strategy, with its flowers being cleistogamous, meaning they self-pollinate without opening. It is native to specific regions in South Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cleisostomopsis salimii is considered a species of conservation concern."
