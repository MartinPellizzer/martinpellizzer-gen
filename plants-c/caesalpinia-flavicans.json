The plant has bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets, and its pods are elongated, woody, and often covered in short hairs. Caesalpinia flavicans is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and can tolerate drought conditions. It is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking floral display."
