    "intro": "Colobanthus lycopodoides, commonly known as the Antarctic pearlwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes and the Antarctic. It is a small, mat-forming herb with tiny, white or pale green flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh, cold environment. It is adapted to extreme conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures. Colobanthus lycopodoides plays a role in stabilizing soil in its alpine and polar habitats."
