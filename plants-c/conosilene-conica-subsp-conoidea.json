    "intro": "Conosilene conica subsp. conoidea, commonly known as the cone-shaped conosilene, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique conical inflorescence, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can receive adequate moisture. Its leaves are usually elongated and have a smooth surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in the characteristic cone shape. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically important species."
