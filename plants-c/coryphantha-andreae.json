    "intro": "Coryphantha andreae, commonly known as the Andean coryphantha, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, branched pedicels. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid and rocky environments. Coryphantha andreae is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
