    "intro": "Carex subspathacea var. rigidiuscula, commonly known as the rigid slender sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of North America. It typically grows in wetland or moist soil environments, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features grass-like leaves that are generally narrow and stiff, with a dark green coloration. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike that bears small, three-lobed flowers. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
