    "intro": "Cenia pectinata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in three-winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. Cenia pectinata is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in some regions."
