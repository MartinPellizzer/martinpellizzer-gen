    "intro": "Chaetogastra goudotii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Chaetogastra goudotii is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value, but caution is advised due to its potentially harmful sap."
