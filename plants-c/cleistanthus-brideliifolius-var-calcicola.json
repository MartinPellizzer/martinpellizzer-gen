    "intro": "Cleistanthus brideliifolius var. calcicola, commonly known as the limestone cleistanthus, is a shrub native to the limestone regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often pubescent and adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, which bloom during the rainy season. Its growth habit is typically compact, with a dense foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to calcareous environments."
