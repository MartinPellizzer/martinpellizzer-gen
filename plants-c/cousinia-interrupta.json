It is a perennial herb with a compact growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. The plant has fibrous roots that help it survive in dry, sandy soils, and its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Cousinia interrupta is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in environments with minimal rainfall."
