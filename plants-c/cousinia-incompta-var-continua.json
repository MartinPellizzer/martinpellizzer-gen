    "intro": "Cousinia incompta var. continua, commonly known as the continuous cushion cottontail, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing cushions of foliage, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, providing additional protection against desiccation. Cousinia incompta var. continua is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in semi-arid climates."
