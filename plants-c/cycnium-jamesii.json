    "intro": "Cycnium jamesii, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a spherical, fleshy capsule that splits open to release seeds. Cycnium jamesii is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats."
