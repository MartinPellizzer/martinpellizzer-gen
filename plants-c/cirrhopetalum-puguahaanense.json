    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum puguahaanense, commonly known as the Pugua Haan orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Ecuador. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid microclimates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers exhibit a unique, curling petal structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
