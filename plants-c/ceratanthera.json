These plants are characterized by their showy, brightly colored flowers that often display a range of hues, hence their common name. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. Ceratanthera species typically have hairy stems and leaves, and their flowers are often arranged in clusters. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of growing conditions."
