    "intro": "Cyperus stewartii, commonly known as Stewart's flatsedge, is a species of flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it often grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas. The plant produces small, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by water or wind. It is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation in wetland habitats."
