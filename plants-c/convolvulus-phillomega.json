    "intro": "Convolvulus phillomega, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves with a silvery underside. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and bloom in the early morning. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
