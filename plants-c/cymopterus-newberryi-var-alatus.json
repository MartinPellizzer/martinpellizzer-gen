It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are alternate and often have a distinctive wing-like structure on the petioles, giving it its varietal name. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution in arid environments."
