    "intro": "Collare-stuartense aurarium, commonly known as the golden collar orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant golden-yellow petals and sepals, which are adorned with intricate, collar-like patterns that give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. Its flowers bloom in late spring, producing a delicate, fragrant aroma that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
