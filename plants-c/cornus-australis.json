It is characterized by its clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are a food source for birds. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green hue. Cornus australis thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens."
