    "intro": "Carex sendaica var. sendaica, commonly known as the Sunda sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
