    "intro": "Cenolophon, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to grow on tree trunks or branches. Cenolophon is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a valuable indicator of ecosystem health. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in protected areas and is a subject of conservation interest."
