    "intro": "Critoniopsis ursicola, commonly known as the giant ground orchid, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its unique morphology includes a tall, slender stem with broad, grass-like leaves and a single, prominent floral spike. Due to its habitat specificity, Critoniopsis ursicola is considered a rare and endangered species."
