It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and fragrant leaves that emit a spicy, camphor-like scent. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late winter or early spring, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. Due to its ornamental value and cultural significance, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
