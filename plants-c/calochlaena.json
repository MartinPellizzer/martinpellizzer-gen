    "intro": "Calochlaena, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale greenish-white flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, making it highly dependent on its host tree for support. Calochlaena thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the bark of large trees. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
