    "intro": "Centaurea caspica, commonly known as the Caspian knapweed, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and bright yellow to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Centaurea caspica is often found in steppe and semi-desert regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
