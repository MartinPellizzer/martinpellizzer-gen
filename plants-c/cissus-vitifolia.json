    "intro": "Cissus vitifolia, commonly known as the grape ivy, is a climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cissus vitifolia is often used in hanging baskets or as a trailing plant due to its attractive foliage and easy care requirements."
