    "intro": "Clermontia oblongifolia subsp. oblongifolia, commonly known as the oblong-leaf clermonthe, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Hawaii. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The species produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments at higher elevations. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
