    "intro": "Calophyllum revolutum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Calophyllaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, orange-colored fruits containing one or two seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and furniture. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its natural range."
