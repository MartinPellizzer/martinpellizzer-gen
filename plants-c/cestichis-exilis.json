    "intro": "Cestichis exilis, commonly known as the slender cestichis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade and high humidity. Its botanical features include slender stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cestichis exilis is considered a species of conservation concern."
