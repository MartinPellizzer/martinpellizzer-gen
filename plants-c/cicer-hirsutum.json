    "intro": "Cicer hirsutum, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of many legumes. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. Hairy vetch is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. It is native to Europe and Asia but has been introduced to various parts of the world for agricultural and ecological purposes."
