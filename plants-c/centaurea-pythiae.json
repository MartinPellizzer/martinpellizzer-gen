    "intro": "Centaurea pythiae, commonly known as the Greek star-thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and spiny, which helps reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The flowers are typically blue to purple in color, adding ornamental value to the landscape."
