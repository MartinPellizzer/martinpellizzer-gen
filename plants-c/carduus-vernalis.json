    "intro": "Carduus vernalis, commonly known as spring cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are rough and lobed, with a distinctive hairy texture, and it produces small, spiky fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal. The plant is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
