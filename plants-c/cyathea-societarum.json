    "intro": "Cyathea societarum, commonly known as the society tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which is a unique trait among ferns. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological importance in tropical forests."
