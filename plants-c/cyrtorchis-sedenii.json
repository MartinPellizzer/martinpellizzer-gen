    "intro": "Cyrtorchis sedenii, commonly known as the Sedenii rock orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The plant produces small, intricate flowers with a unique coloration pattern, typically featuring a combination of white, green, and purple hues. Its floral structure is specialized for pollination by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cyrtorchis sedenii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
