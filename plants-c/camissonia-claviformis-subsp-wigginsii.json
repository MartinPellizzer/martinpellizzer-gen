    "intro": "Camissonia claviformis subsp. wigginsii, commonly known as the Wiggins' broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It is native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon, where it grows in open, dry habitats. The plant has a slender, branching stem and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes other hemiparasitic plants. Due to its specialized growth habits and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
