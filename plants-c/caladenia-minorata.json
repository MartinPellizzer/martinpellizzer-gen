    "intro": "Caladenia minorata, commonly known as the Crimson Spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Australia. It typically grows in heathland and open forest habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features a single, slender stem with a single or occasionally two flowers, each resembling a spider in appearance. Its flowers are usually deep red or orange-red with intricate patterns, and they bloom from late autumn to early spring. Caladenia minorata is a protected species due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss."
