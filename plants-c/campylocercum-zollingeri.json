    "intro": "Campylocercum zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, which are typical of the spurge family. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It produces a milky, latex-like sap that can be toxic if ingested. The plant's botanical features make it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments."
