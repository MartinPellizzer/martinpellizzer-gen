    "intro": "Carex alba f. aprica, commonly known as the white sedge, is a variant of the common sedge species Carex alba. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its white or pale green flowers appear in late spring to early summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. The leaves are usually narrow and slightly curled, contributing to its distinctive appearance in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
