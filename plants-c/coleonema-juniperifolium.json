It features small, oval leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in spring, followed by bright red berries in autumn. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. Coleonema juniperifolium is relatively drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant."
