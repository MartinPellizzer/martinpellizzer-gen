    "intro": "Carex heleonastes var. scabriuscula, commonly known as the rough-skinned sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-ranked flowers, and it produces achene fruits. This variety is distinguished by its rough, scaly texture on the leaves, which gives it its common name."
