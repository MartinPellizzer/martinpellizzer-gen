    "intro": "Centaurea scabiosa f. subheterophylla, commonly known as the heterophyllous cudweed, is a variant of the common cudweed, characterized by its distinct leaf morphology. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant features blue to purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny, bract-like leaves. Its leaves exhibit a unique variation in shape and size, giving rise to its name \"subheterophylla,\" meaning \"subordinate heterophyllous.\" This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
