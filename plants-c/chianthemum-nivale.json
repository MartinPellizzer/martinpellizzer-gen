    "intro": "Chianthemum nivale, commonly known as the snow chianthemum, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-gray, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Chianthemum nivale is often found in meadows and mountainous areas, contributing to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems."
