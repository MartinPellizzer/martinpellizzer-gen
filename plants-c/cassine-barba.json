    "intro": "Cassine barba, commonly known as the barbados cassine, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lythraceae. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it typically grows in moist, tropical environments. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces clusters of small, red flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Cassine barba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant foliage and floral display."
