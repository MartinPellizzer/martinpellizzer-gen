    "intro": "Ctenitis pentangulara, commonly known as the angular sea holly, is a species of flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, giving them a silvery appearance. Its flowers are typically blue or violet and are arranged in clusters, forming a striking visual contrast against the silver foliage. Ctenitis pentangulara is well adapted to salty, windy coastal environments and is often found growing on rocky shores or sandy dunes."
