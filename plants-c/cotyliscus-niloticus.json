    "intro": "Cotyliscus niloticus, commonly known as the Nile cotyliscus, is a species of aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of Africa. It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its submerged, ribbon-like leaves that form dense underwater mats. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and plays a role in stabilizing sediment and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Its reproductive structures are small, flowering spikes that emerge from the water surface, contributing to its ecological significance in wetland environments."
