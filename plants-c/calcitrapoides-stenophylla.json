    "intro": "Calcitrapoides stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf calcitrap, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions with unique geological conditions. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves that are adapted to low-nutrient environments. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable indicator species for certain ecological studies."
