    "intro": "Calamintha alpina f. albiflora, commonly known as the alpine germander, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. This subspecies is distinguished by its pale white flowers, which contrast with the typical blue or purple hues of the main species. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in full sun. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
