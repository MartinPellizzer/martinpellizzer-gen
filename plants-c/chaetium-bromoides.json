    "intro": "Chaetium bromoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false brome, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and rocky soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spike-like clusters of flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native range."
