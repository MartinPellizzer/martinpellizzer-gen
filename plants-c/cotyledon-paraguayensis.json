    "intro": "Cotyledon paraguayensis, commonly known as the Paraguay leaf or Paraguay cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South America. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant typically has a low-growing, compact form with leaves that are often green or variegated in color. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, typically during the spring or summer months. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
