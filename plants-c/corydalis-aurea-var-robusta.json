It features delicate, clustered flowers that range from yellow to orange, with two prominent upper petals and two smaller lower petals. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal in gardens. Corydalis aurea var. robusta is valued for its early spring bloom and is often cultivated for its aesthetic and medicinal properties."
