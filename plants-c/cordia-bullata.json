    "intro": "Cordia bullata, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, succulent leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves. Cordia bullata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
