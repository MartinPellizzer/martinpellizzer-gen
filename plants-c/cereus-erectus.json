    "intro": "Cereus erectus, commonly known as the erect night bloomer, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Cereus erectus is often cultivated for its striking appearance and unique flowering behavior."
