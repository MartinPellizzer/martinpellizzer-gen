    "intro": "Cerastium cuspidatum, commonly known as the sharp-tipped mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, hairy, oval-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
