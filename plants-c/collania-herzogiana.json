    "intro": "Collania herzogiana, commonly known as the Herzog's collania, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are small and white or pale green, often clustered together in a compact, spherical shape. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Collania herzogiana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
