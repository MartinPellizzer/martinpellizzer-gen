    "intro": "Camptostylus litoralis, commonly known as the beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Camptostylus litoralis plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
