    "intro": "Cissampelos ovalifolia var. cinerescens, commonly known as the ash-leaf moonvine, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped, pale green leaves with a distinctive ashy or grayish underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. Its stems are often hairy and can climb using tendrils, making it a common sight in forest understories. The leaves are typically arranged in opposite pairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal in shaded environments."
