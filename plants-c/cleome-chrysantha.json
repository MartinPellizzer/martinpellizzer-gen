It is characterized by its showy, clustered yellow flowers that resemble spider legs, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet and has slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture with serrated edges. Cleome chrysantha is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
