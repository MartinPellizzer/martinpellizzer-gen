    "intro": "Caryocar gracile, commonly known as the Brazilian chestnut or small-capsuled billygoat, is a small tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Caryocaraceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, spherical fruits that are covered in a thick, fleshy coating. Its seeds are enclosed in a hard, woody capsule, which is typical of the genus Caryocar. Due to habitat loss, Caryocar gracile is considered threatened and is of interest for conservation and ecological studies."
