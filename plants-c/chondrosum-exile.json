    "intro": "Chondrosum exile, commonly known as the slender rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It has small, pinnately divided leaves that are adapted to cold and harsh environments. The plant produces tiny, white or yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in gravelly habitats. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of environmental conditions."
