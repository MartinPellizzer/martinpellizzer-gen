    "intro": "Carduus hookerianus var. eriocephalus, commonly known as the Hooker's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its robust, upright stems and large, deeply lobed leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow composite flowers that are surrounded by a distinctive, woolly involucrum of bracts. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its potential to become invasive."
