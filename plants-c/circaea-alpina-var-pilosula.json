    "intro": "Circaea alpina var. pilosula, commonly known as the hairy willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems covered in fine, white hairs, which give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
