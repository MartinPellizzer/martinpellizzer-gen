    "intro": "Calceolaria tripartita subsp. cajamarcensis, commonly known as the Andean slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Peru and Ecuador. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its distinctive calyx-like structure that resembles a slipper, which is a key feature in its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Andean cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
