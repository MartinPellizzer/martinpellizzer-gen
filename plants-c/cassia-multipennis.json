    "intro": "Cassia multipennis, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and long, pendulous clusters of yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant produces small, angular pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cassia multipennis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common species in urban and rural landscapes."
