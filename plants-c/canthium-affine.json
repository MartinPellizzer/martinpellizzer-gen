    "intro": "Canthium affine, commonly known as the African eggplant or small-leaved spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
