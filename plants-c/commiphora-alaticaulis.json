It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its slender, elongated trunk and dense, dark green foliage. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsules that release aromatic resin. This resin has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of incense."
