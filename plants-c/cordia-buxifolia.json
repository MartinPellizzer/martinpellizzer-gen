    "intro": "Cordia buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf cordia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The plant features glossy, dark green, leathery leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces fleshy, orange-red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Cordia buxifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
