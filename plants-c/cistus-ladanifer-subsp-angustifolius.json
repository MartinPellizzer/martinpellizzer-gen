    "intro": "Cistus ladanifer subsp. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that exude a resinous scent. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or coastal environments. Its subspecies status reflects slight morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf shape and size."
