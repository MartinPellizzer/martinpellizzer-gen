    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris var. hammondii, commonly known as Hammond's heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of Scotland. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland environments. Its leaves are narrow, dark green, and retain their color throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to provide year-round interest in garden settings."
