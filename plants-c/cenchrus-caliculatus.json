    "intro": "Cenchrus caliculatus, commonly known as the needle grass, is a perennial grass native to the warmer regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its sharp, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration and wildlife habitat."
