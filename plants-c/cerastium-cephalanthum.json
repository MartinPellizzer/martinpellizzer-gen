    "intro": "Cerastium cephalanthum, commonly known as mountain chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has hairy, alternate leaves that are oval to lance-shaped, and it produces small, oval fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
