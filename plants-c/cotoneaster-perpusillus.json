It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and features tiny, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens as a hardy, low-maintenance plant."
