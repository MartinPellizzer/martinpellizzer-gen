    "intro": "Clemensiella mariae, commonly known as the Marie's clemensiella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that form a central cup to collect water. Its flowers, which are typically small and clustered, are often brightly colored, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Clemensiella mariae is considered a conservation concern."
