It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal areas and is adapted to saline and windy conditions. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor firmly in unstable substrates. The leaves are bi-lobed and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
