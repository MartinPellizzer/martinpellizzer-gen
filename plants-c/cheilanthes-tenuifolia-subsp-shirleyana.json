    "intro": "Cheilanthes tenuifolia subsp. shirleyana, commonly known as Shirley's rockcap, is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in arid and rocky environments. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically light green and covered in a fine layer of trichomes. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can tolerate periods of drought. This subspecies is often found in coastal regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience."
