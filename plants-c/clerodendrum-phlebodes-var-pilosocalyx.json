It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a subtle fragrance. Its stems are typically woody and can become somewhat branched as the plant matures. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in warm climates for its aesthetic appeal."
