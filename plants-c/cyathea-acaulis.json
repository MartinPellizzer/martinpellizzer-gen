    "intro": "Cyathea acaulis, commonly known as the tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered with persistent, overlapping leaf bases. The plant has a distinctive crown of large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea acaulis typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forests or along stream banks. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable component of ecological and horticultural landscapes."
