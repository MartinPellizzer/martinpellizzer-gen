    "intro": "Cremanthodium gypsophilum, commonly known as the gypsum lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils, often on gypsum or limestone substrates. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Cremanthodium gypsophilum is a rare and endangered species, with limited geographic distribution and specific ecological requirements."
