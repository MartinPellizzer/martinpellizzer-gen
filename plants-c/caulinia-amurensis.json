    "intro": "Caulinia amurensis, commonly known as the Amur thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested or wetland areas. The plant features a robust root system and produces spiny, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in a head, with purple to pinkish hues, and it blooms in late summer. Caulinia amurensis is known for its ability to thrive in temperate climates and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
