    "intro": "Convolvulus laciniatus f. pinnatisecta, commonly known as the pinnatisected morning glory, is a variant of the species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its modest floral display."
