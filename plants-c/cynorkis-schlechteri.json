    "intro": "Cynorkis schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Cycadaceae. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
