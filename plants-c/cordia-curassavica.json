    "intro": "Cordia curassavica, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and succulent, lance-shaped leaves that help it retain water in saline environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries containing several seeds. It thrives in coastal areas, often forming dense thickets in mangrove swamps and estuaries. Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
