    "intro": "Cirsium coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and canyons. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in arid landscapes."
