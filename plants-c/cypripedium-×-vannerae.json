    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 vannerae, commonly known as the Vanerae lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pink or white with a yellowish throat, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
