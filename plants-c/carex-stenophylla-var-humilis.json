    "intro": "Carex stenophylla var. humilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedges, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green and have a distinct midrib. It produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is relatively low-growing, with a compact habit, making it suitable for wetland restoration and ornamental use in water gardens."
