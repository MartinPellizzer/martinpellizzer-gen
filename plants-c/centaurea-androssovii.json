    "intro": "Centaurea androssovii, commonly known as the Andros Island centaury, is a flowering plant native to the island of Andros in the Greek Cyclades. It is a low-growing perennial with striking red-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces bristly, spiny seed heads. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
