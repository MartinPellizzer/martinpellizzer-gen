    "intro": "Coniogramme fraxinea, commonly known as the yellow wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively. The spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
