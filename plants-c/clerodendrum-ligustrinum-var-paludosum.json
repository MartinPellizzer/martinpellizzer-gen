    "intro": "Clerodendrum ligustrinum var. paludosum, commonly known as swamp clerodendrum, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy and have a distinct reddish or purple vein pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that are typically borne in terminal spikes. Its fruit is a spherical, dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. This variant is adapted to moist, swampy environments and is often found in marshy areas along riverbanks and in lowland forests."
