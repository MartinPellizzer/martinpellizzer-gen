    "intro": "Collomiastrum debile, commonly known as the slender collomia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It is often found in open habitats such as meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
