    "intro": "Caulokaempferia secunda, commonly known as the white ginger orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
