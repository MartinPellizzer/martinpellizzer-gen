    "intro": "Carex virescens var. swanii, commonly known as the Swan\u2019s sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and slightly hairy, with a dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a popular choice for wetland restoration projects."
