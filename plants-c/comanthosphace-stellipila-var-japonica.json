    "intro": "Comanthosphace stellipila var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese star moss, is a rare and delicate moss species native to Japan. It is characterized by its star-shaped, clustered growth pattern and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a low-growing habit with small, overlapping leaves that form dense, cushion-like structures. It is often found in forest understories, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
