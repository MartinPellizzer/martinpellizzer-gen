    "intro": "Cenostigma eriostachys, commonly known as the hairy leaf cenostigma, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central America and northern South America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fibrous roots make it well adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. Cenostigma eriostachys is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
