    "intro": "Cochlearia natans, commonly known as floating bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, floating leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help it stay buoyant. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and ditches. Its unique adaptations allow it to float and photosynthesize efficiently in aquatic settings."
