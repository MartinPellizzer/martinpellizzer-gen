    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris f. compressa, commonly known as the compact heather, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the British Isles. It is a variant of the common heather, characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of pinkish-white flowers in late summer, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland environments. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, attractive ground cover."
