It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. Thomson's sedge typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and stream sides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive triangular cross-section characteristic of many sedges. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers, which are wind-pollinated."
