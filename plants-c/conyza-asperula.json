    "intro": "Conyza asperula, commonly known as rough hawksbeard, is an annual flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has hairy, rough leaves and produces small yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Conyza asperula is considered a weed but has been studied for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals."
