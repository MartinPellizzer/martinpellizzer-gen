    "intro": "Coffea coursiana subsp. coursiana, commonly known as the African coffee tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries containing one or two seeds. It is primarily cultivated for its seeds, which are used to make coffee, though it is less commercially significant than other coffee species. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
