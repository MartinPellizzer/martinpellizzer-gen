    "intro": "Calligonum \u00d7 spinulosum, commonly known as the hybrid saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and gray-green leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is highly salt-tolerant and thrives in saline soils, making it valuable for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes. Its robust growth habit and resilience to drought make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
