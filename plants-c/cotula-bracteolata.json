    "intro": "Cotula bracteolata, commonly known as the African daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in clusters, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Cotula bracteolata is often used in ornamental gardening due to its delicate appearance and hardy nature."
