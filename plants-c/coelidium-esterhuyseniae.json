    "intro": "Coelidium esterhuyseniae, commonly known as the Esterhuysenia candelabra, is a unique member of the Arecaceae family, native to the tropical regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its branched, tree-like structure with multiple stems forming a candelabra shape. The plant produces large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and horticulture. Its flowering is rare, with small yellowish flowers appearing at the base of the stems. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
