    "intro": "Carpha hexandra, commonly known as the slender flat sedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, and it thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes and riverbanks. Carpha hexandra is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its botanical significance lies in its ecological role within wetland ecosystems."
