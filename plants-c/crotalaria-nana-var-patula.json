    "intro": "Crotalaria nana var. patula, commonly known as dwarf rattlebox, is a low-growing annual herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, clustered yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Crotalaria genus. The plant produces distinctive, spiny seed pods that contain toxic seeds, which can be harmful to livestock. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical characteristics make it both a valuable forage plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
