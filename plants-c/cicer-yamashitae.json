    "intro": "Cicer yamashitae, commonly known as the Yamashita cicer, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Fabaceae family. It is native to specific regions in Japan, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive, velvety texture, and its small, pea-like flowers are typically pale green or white. Cicer yamashitae produces pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
