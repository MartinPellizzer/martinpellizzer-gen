    "intro": "Catasetum viride, commonly known as the green cat claw, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, claw-like sepals and petals that resemble a cat's claw, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, elongated spur. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Catasetum viride is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a member of the Orchidaceae family."
