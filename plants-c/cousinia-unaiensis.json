    "intro": "Cousinia unaiensis, commonly known as the Tibetan hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant produces yellow ray florets surrounded by tightly packed disk florets, typical of the genus Cousinia. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Cousinia unaiensis is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat."
