    "intro": "Cheiridopsis meyeri var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is well-suited for container gardening as well."
