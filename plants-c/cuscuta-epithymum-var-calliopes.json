    "intro": "Cuscuta epithymum var. calliopes, commonly known as the golden dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and is often found on various shrubs and trees. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its parasitic nature, it can sometimes cause damage to its host plants."
