The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils, showing adaptability to arid environments. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, and it is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
