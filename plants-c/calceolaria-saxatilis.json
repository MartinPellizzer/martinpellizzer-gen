It is characterized by its unique bilabiate flowers, which resemble small cups or pouches, and are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It has slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions. Calceolaria saxatilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific growing conditions."
