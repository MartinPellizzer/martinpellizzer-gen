    "intro": "Cadia, commonly known as the mountain cedar, is a deciduous tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Cupressaceae family, which includes cypresses and junipers, and is characterized by its scale-like leaves and woody, aromatic bark. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Cadia is well adapted to dry climates, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in harsh, rocky environments."
