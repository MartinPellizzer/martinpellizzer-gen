    "intro": "Cousinia bobekii, commonly known as the Afghan cottonthistle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features a robust, branching stem covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green, with a fuzzy texture, and it produces showy yellow to orange flowers in late summer. Cousinia bobekii is adapted to high altitudes and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
