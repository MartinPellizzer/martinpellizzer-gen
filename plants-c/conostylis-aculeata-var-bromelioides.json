It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact inflorescence. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that are clustered in a raceme, often resembling those of bromeliads, hence its varietal name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
