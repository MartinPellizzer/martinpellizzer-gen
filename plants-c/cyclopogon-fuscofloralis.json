    "intro": "Cyclopogon fuscofloralis, commonly known as the dark-flowered cyclopogon, is a rare bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, dark purple to black flowers that contrast with its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its inflorescence is unique, featuring a single, elongated flower that emerges from a cluster of bracts. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
