    "intro": "Cerastium arvense var. laricifolium, commonly known as the mountain chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of stems. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, often resembling those of a larch tree, hence its scientific name. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and woodland edges. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
