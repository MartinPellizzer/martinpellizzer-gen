    "intro": "Candollea pachyrrhiza, commonly known as the thick-stemmed cactus, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its robust, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions. Its unique morphology makes it an interesting subject for botanical study and a valuable plant for xeriscaping."
