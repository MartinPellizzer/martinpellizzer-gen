    "intro": "Cardiopteris javanica, commonly known as the Java shield fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a shield-shaped base and delicate, lanceolate pinnae. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Cardiopteris javanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
