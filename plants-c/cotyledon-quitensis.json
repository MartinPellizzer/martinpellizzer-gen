It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions. Its leaves are usually green with a waxy coating, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of yellow or white. Cotyledon quitensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in drought conditions."
