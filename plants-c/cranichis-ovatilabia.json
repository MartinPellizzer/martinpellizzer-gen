    "intro": "Cranichis ovatilabia, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and delicate, orchid-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
