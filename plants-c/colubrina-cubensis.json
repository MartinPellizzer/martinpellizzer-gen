    "intro": "Colubrina cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Bahamas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, bright purple berries that are a striking feature of its appearance. These berries are often consumed by birds and other wildlife, aiding in seed dispersal. The leaves are simple, opposite, and have a slightly glossy surface, contributing to its ornamental value."
