    "intro": "Cephalophyllum cauliculatum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded, fleshy stems that resemble small, swollen bulbs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help it conserve water in arid conditions. Cephalophyllum cauliculatum is a prized addition to rock gardens and xerophytic collections due to its unusual morphology and low maintenance requirements."
