    "intro": "Campanula rapunculoides var. rigida, commonly known as rigid bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that can grow up to 60 cm tall, bearing opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped blue to violet flowers from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
