    "intro": "Coddingtonia parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a flowering plant that belongs to the Orchidaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in forested areas, attaching itself to the roots of other vegetation. Its small, delicate flowers are usually greenish-yellow in color, and it produces small, round fruits. Due to its specialized growth habits, it is often found in shaded, moist environments where its hosts thrive."
