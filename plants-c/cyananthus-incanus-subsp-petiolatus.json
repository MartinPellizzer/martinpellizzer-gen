    "intro": "Cyananthus incanus subsp. petiolatus, commonly known as the slender-flowered cyananthus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, blue or purple flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated petioles, which are longer than those of the typical form. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
