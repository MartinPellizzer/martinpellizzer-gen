    "intro": "Cyclosorus \u00d7 erubesquirolicus, commonly known as the red-flowered cyclosorus, is a hybrid fern species that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Cyclosorus acutus and Cyclosorus rutilus, both native to Southeast Asia. The plant is distinguished by its vibrant red spore cases, which contrast sharply with its green fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of rare ferns."
