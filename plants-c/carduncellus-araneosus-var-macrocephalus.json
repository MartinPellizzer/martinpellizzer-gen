The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. This species is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
