It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly rough in texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on elongated, cylindrical stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.
