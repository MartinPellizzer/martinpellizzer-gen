    "intro": "Crataegus padifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its simple, elliptic leaves that are usually less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces white to pink flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, stream banks, and other wetland habitats. Crataegus padifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
