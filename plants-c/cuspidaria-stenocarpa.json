    "intro": "Cuspidaria stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited cuspidaria, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that are typically narrow and elongated, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
