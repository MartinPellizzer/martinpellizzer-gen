It is characterized by its distinctive, net-like veins on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Calycogonium reticulatum is native to tropical regions of Africa and thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
