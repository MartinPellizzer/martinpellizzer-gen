    "intro": "Cyperus subaphyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedgeland, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and flowering spikes. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swampy areas and seasonally flooded soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are pollinated by wind. Cyperus subaphyllus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
