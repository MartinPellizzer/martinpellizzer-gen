    "intro": "Coccoloba fagifolia, commonly known as the Florida beauty or red mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas, particularly in mangrove ecosystems. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually red or reddish-purple when young, turning green as they mature. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in inflorescences and are followed by small, fleshy, red berries. Coccoloba fagifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
