    "intro": "Combretum acutum, commonly known as the sharp-leaved combretum, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its simple, often lance-shaped leaves that are typically pubescent. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Combretum acutum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some regions."
