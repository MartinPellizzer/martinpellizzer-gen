    "intro": "Cyphanthera albicans, commonly known as the white-flowered legume, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. Its root system is adapted to survive in dry conditions, and it plays a role in soil stabilization in its native habitat. Cyphanthera albicans is often found in open woodlands and is valued for its ecological and ornamental significance."
