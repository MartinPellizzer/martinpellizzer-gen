    "intro": "Cycnium huttoniae, commonly known as the Hutton's bladder nut, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy inflorescence that resembles a bladder. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Cycnium huttoniae is known for its unique morphology and is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
