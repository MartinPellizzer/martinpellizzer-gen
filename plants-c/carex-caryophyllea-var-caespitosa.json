    "intro": "Carex caryophyllea var. caespitosa, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial sedge native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit and its striking purple-tinted inflorescence that appears in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
