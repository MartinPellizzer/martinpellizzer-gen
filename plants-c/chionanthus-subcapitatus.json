    "intro": "Chionanthus subcapitatus, commonly known as the western flowering plantain, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features slender, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a dense, spike-like cluster at the tip of the stem. These flowers are typically borne in late spring to early summer, and the plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils. It is often found in meadows, stream banks, and other open, sunny habitats."
