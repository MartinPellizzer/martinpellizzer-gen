    "intro": "Caralluma arabica, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and potatoes, and is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems and small, star-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow or white flowers and small berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Caralluma arabica is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It is also valued for its traditional use in some cultures as a stimulant and appetite suppressant."
