It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and blue to purple flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its striking coloration and unique morphology make it a notable species in botanical studies."
