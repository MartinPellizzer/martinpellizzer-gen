    "intro": "Ceropteris argentea, commonly known as the silver fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery-white powder, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The silver fern is also valued as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ease of cultivation."
