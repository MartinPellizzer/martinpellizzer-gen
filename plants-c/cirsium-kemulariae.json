    "intro": "Cirsium kemulariae, commonly known as the Kemularia thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, leafy stems and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are usually deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in a compact cluster. Cirsium kemulariae is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
