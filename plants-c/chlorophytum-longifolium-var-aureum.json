It is characterized by its long, arching leaves that often feature a striking yellow or gold border, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by delicate, grass-like seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to bright indirect light. This hardy plant is easy to care for and is often used in hanging baskets or as a trailing plant in gardens and indoor spaces."
