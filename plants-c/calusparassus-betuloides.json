    "intro": "Calusparassus betuloides, commonly known as the silverleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits called samaras. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. The leaves turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value."
