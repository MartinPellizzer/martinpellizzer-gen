    "intro": "Croton oligandrus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved croton, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiny capsules containing seeds. Croton oligandrus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for taxonomic study and ecological research."
