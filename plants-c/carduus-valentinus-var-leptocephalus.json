    "intro": "Carduus valentinus var. leptocephalus, commonly known as the slender milk thistle, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features a robust taproot and upright stems that are often covered with fine, white hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with a distinctive, spiny involucrum that protects the flower heads. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with a rough texture and a milky sap when crushed. This variety is closely related to other species of the genus Carduus and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
