    "intro": "Calanthe striata var. unilamellata, commonly known as the narrow-lamella calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and distinctive, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a prized species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered vulnerable in some regions."
