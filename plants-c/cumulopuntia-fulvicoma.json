    "intro": "Cumulopuntia fulvicoma, commonly known as the golden crown cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically clustered at the top of the stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Cumulopuntia fulvicoma is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh environments."
