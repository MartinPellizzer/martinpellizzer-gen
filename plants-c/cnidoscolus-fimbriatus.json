    "intro": "Cnidoscolus fimbriatus, commonly known as the spiny leaf tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically large and deeply lobed, often with spines along the leaf margins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into edible, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils or near riverbanks. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
