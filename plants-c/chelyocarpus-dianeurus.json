    "intro": "Chelyocarpus dianeurus, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Combretaceae. It is native to tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. Its small, white flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. This species plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing shorelines."
