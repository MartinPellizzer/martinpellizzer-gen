This annual plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is characterized by its spiny, spherical fruits and large, heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in fields. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its wide distribution and resilience."
