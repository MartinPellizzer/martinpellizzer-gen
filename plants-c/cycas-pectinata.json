    "intro": "Cycas pectinata, commonly known as the pectinata cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base of the plant and female cones emerging from the trunk. Cycas pectinata is a slow-growing, long-lived species that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is also notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
