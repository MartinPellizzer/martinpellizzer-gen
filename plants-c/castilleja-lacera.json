    "intro": "Castilleja lacera, commonly known as the slender paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
