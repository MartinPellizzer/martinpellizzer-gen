    "intro": "Calonyction chenopodiifolium, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has small, spine-tipped leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to survive in sandy soils with minimal water. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
