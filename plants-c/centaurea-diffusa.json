    "intro": "Centaurea diffusa, commonly known as the diffuse cornflower, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branched stems that often grow up to 60 cm in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its ability to spread rapidly. Centaurea diffusa is sometimes considered a weed due to its invasive tendencies in certain regions."
