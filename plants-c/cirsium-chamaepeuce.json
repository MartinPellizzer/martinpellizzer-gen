    "intro": "Cirsium chamaepeuce, commonly known as the creeping thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its leaves are spiny and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which serve as a natural defense mechanism. The plant produces purple to pink flowers in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
