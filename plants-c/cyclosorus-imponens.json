    "intro": "Cyclosorus imponens, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in swampy areas and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The fronds are divided into numerous small, serrated leaflets, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
