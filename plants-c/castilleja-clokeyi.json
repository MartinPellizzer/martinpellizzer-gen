    "intro": "Castilleja clokeyi, commonly known as the Clokey\u2019s paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
