    "intro": "Coniogramme bashanensis, commonly known as the Bashan coniogramme, is a rare and delicate fern native to China. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, elegant structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
