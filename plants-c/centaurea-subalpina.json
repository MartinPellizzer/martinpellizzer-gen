    "intro": "Centaurea subalpina, commonly known as the alpine knapweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers, which are surrounded by narrow, bristly leaves. It has a compact growth habit and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Centaurea subalpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in high-altitude ecosystems."
