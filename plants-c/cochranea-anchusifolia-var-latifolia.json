    "intro": "Cochranea anchusifolia var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf cochranea, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers shady to semi-shaded conditions."
