It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
