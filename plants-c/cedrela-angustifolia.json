    "intro": "Cedrela angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its straight-grained, heavy, and durable wood, which is highly valued in the furniture and construction industries. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing one or two seeds. Cedrela angustifolia thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests."
