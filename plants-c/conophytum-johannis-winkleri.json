It is a small, succulent plant characterized by its paired, fleshy leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
