    "intro": "Cunonia \u00d7 koghicola, commonly known as the hybrid cunonia, is a plant resulting from the crossbreeding of two species within the Cunonia genus. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to southern Africa, characterized by its dense foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers during the summer months. Cunonia \u00d7 koghicola is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and sandy soils. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as birds and insects."
