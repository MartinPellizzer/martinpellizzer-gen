    "intro": "Cyclosorus palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's cyclosorus, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged substrates. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant within its habitat. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
