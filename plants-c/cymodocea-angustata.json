It typically grows in shallow, sandy or muddy substrates in marine environments. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often curved and arranged in dense underwater mats. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for marine life. Cymodocea angustata is also important in carbon sequestration and coastal protection."
