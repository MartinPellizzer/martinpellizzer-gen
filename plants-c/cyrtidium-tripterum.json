    "intro": "Cyrtidium tripterum, commonly known as the three-winged fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its small, clustered spore-producing structures are positioned on the underside of its fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyrtidium tripterum is considered a rare and endangered species."
