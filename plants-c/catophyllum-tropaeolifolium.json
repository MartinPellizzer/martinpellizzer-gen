    "intro": "Catophyllum tropaeolifolium, commonly known as the tropical leaf cactus, is a unique succulent native to the humid regions of Central and South America. It features fleshy, upright stems that are often branched and covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. Despite its cactus-like appearance, it is botanically classified within the family Cactaceae, which includes a wide variety of succulent plants."
