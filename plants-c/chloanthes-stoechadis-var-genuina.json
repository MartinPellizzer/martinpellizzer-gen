    "intro": "Chloanthes stoechadis var. genuina, commonly known as the white-flowered chloanthes, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems that bear opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
