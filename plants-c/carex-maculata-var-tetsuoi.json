It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with distinctive dark green leaves that have a subtle silvery sheen. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to yellowish flowers in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground covers in shaded areas."
