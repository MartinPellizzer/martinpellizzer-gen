    "intro": "Cardamine macrophylla var. moupinensis, commonly known as the Moupin watercress, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
