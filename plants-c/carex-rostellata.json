    "intro": "Carex rostellata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, grass-green leaves that are typically arranged in a tight, cylindrical cluster. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typically found in wet or moist environments. It thrives in shaded to partially sunny conditions and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. Carex rostellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
