It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and heart-shaped, velvety leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
