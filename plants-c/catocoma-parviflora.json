    "intro": "Catocoma parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered catocoma, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States, particularly Florida and parts of Georgia. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, circular clusters. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
