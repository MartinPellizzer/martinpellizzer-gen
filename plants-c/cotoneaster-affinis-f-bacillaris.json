    "intro": "Cotoneaster affinis f. bacillaris, commonly known as the bacillaris cotoneaster, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and densely arranged along the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a resilient choice for rock gardens or as a landscape accent. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant autumn foliage and persistent berries."
