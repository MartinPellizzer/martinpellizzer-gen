    "intro": "Capsicophysalis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant species native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its striking, translucent pink petals that appear to glow in low light conditions. The plant has a short flowering period, typically during the cooler months, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Due to its rare habitat and limited distribution, Capsicophysalis is considered a conservation concern."
