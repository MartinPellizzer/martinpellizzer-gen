    "intro": "Croton amentiformis, commonly known as the weeping croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive drooping clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, which give it its \"weeping\" appearance. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are typically green with a reddish or purple underside. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a visually striking and relatively low-maintenance plant."
