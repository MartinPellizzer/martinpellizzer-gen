    "intro": "Colchicum woronowii, commonly known as the Armenian colchic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It features striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has a robust corm-like structure that serves as its storage organ, allowing it to survive harsh winters. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Colchicum woronowii is also valued for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic alkaloids that require careful handling."
