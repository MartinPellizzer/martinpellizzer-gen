    "intro": "Ceratochloa unioloides, commonly known as the slender water millet, is a small annual grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and rice paddies, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. Its seeds are dispersed by water, allowing it to spread efficiently in aquatic habitats. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
