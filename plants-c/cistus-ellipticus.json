    "intro": "Cistus ellipticus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Cistus ellipticus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
