    "intro": "Corymborkis angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in association with other orchid species in its native habitat. The plant has a fibrous root system and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
