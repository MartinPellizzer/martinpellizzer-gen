    "intro": "Clinostigma samoense, commonly known as the Samoan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Samoa. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and saline conditions. It has small, narrow leaves and produces showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat."
