It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cyanus hekimhanensis is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its botanical features include hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it adapt to its harsh, alpine environment."
