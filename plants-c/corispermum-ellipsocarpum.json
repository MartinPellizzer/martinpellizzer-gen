    "intro": "Corispermum ellipsocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-fruit bladderwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is a small annual herb that typically grows in saline or alkaline soils, often found in coastal areas or inland salt marshes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, and its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Its leaves are alternate and often reduced, with specialized structures adapted for survival in harsh environments. The species is noted for its ability to tolerate high salinity and is considered a halophyte, making it an important component of certain ecological communities."
