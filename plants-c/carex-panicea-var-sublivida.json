    "intro": "Carex panicea var. sublivida, commonly known as the silver-haired sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically silver-green in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces panicles of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
