    "intro": "Carex divulsa var. javanica, commonly known as the Javan sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. It produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating, contributing to its ability to retain moisture in humid conditions."
