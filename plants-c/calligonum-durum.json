    "intro": "Calligonum durum, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Calligonum durum is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in sandy and degraded landscapes."
