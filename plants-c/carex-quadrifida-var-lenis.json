It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled at the tips. Its flowering spikes are usually slender and contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is distinguished by its more lax, softer appearance compared to the typical form of Carex quadrifida."
