    "intro": "Chondrosea cotyledon, commonly known as the desert bean, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, pale green cotyledons, which are the first leaves to emerge from the seed. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces small, hard pods containing one or two seeds. The botanical features of Chondrosea cotyledon make it well adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments."
