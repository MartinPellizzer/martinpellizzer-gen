    "intro": "Cardenanthus orurensis, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range from white to deep pink. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils and withstand periods of drought. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
