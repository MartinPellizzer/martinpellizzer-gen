    "intro": "Campanula glomerata var. farinosa, commonly known as the farinose bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, often grayish leaves that give it a distinctive appearance and help it retain moisture. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to both wild and cultivated landscapes."
