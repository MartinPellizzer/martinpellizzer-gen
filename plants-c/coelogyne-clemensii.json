It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white and yellow. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically strap-like and arranged in a fan shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Coelogyne clemensii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
