    "intro": "Corallorhiza odontorhiza, commonly known as the toothroot coralroot, is an orchid that lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrition. It is a root-parasitic plant found in the eastern United States, typically in moist, shaded woodlands. The plant has a slender, branched stem and produces small, pale green or white flowers. Its roots are specialized to form symbiotic relationships with fungi in the soil. Due to its parasitic nature and reliance on specific fungal associations, it is considered rare and often difficult to detect."
