    "intro": "Cereus alticostatus, commonly known as the mountain cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in arid environments. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert conditions."
