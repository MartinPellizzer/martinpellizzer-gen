It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences that consist of dense clusters of small, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
