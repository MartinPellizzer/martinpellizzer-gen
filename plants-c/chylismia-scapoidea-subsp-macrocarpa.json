    "intro": "Chylismia scapoidea subsp. macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant stalked chylismia, is a striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often adorned with large, umbrella-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are finely divided and fern-like, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Native to southern Africa, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
