It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
