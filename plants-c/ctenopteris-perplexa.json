    "intro": "Ctenopteris perplexa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Ctenopteris perplexa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
