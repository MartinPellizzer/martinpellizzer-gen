    "intro": "Cyperus cyperoides var. polyphyllus, commonly known as the broadleaf flatsedge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments. It features slender, grass-like stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are typically narrow and slightly curved. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in inflorescences at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural or ornamental landscapes."
