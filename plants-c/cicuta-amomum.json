    "intro": "Cicuta amomum, commonly known as water hemlock, is a highly toxic member of the parsley family (Apiaceae). It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, hollow stems and umbrella-like clusters of small, white or greenish flowers. The plant contains potent toxic compounds, primarily cicutoxin, which can cause severe poisoning in both humans and animals. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and wetlands. Due to its extreme toxicity, it is often considered one of the most dangerous plants in North America."
