It is native to parts of East Asia, including Japan, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically green or brown in color. It is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation in suitable conditions."
