    "intro": "Ceterach \u00d7 mantoniae, commonly known as the hybrid rock fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Ceterach comosum and Ceterach islandicum, two species that are both endemic to the region. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. Its leaves are typically dark green and covered in a fine, whitish powdery coating, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Ceterach \u00d7 mantoniae is considered a vulnerable species."
