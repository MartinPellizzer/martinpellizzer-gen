    "intro": "Carex denudata, commonly known as the naked sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Carex denudata is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
