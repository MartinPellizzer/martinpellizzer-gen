    "intro": "Cordia chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas cordia, is a small evergreen tree native to Central America. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
