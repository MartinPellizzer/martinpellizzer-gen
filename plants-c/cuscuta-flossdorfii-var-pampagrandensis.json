    "intro": "Cuscuta flossdorfii var. pampagrandensis, commonly known as the giant dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It is characterized by its yellow-orange color and slender, thread-like stems that twine around its host. This variety is native to South America and is often found growing on grasses and shrubs. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, and it produces tiny, dry fruits that contain seeds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
