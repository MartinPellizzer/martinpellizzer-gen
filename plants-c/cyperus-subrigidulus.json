    "intro": "Cyperus subrigidulus, commonly known as the rigid flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its slender, grass-like leaves are usually arranged in a triangular cross-section, a characteristic feature of many sedges. Cyperus subrigidulus produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are clustered in dense inflorescences."
