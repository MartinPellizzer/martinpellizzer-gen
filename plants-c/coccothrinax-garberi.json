    "intro": "Coccothrinax garberi, commonly known as the Garber's palm, is a species of palm native to the island of Hispaniola. It is characterized by its slender trunk and pinnate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into clustered fruits, which are edible and have a sweet, fibrous pulp. It thrives in coastal and limestone soils, often found in dry, sunny environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
