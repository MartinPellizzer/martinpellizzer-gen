    "intro": "Columnea querceti, commonly known as the oakleaf columnea, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that resemble oak leaves, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting throat. These flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds, which are attracted to the nectar-rich blooms. Columnea querceti thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and greenhouses."
