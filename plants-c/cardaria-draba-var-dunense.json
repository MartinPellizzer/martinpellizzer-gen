    "intro": "Cardaria draba var. dunense, commonly known as the Alpine whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its compact growth habit and resilience make it a characteristic species of alpine meadows."
