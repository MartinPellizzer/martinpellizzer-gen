    "intro": "Cerastium purpurascens subsp. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-stemmed mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features prostrate or ascending stems that are typically tinged with purple, especially under stress or in cooler conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, rounded, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic \"mouse-ear\" appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or grassy areas."
