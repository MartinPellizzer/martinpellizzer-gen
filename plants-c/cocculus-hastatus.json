    "intro": "Cocculus hastatus, commonly known as the devil's-bit cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Bindweed, characterized by its climbing habit and tuberous roots. The plant produces distinctive spiny fruits that contain toxic seeds, which have been used historically in traditional medicine. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and yellowish-green. Due to its toxicity, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
