    "intro": "Crataegus tenuispina, commonly known as the slenderthorn hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, featuring thorny branches and oval, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its fruits are an important food source for birds and small mammals, and the plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Crataegus tenuispina is adapted to a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
