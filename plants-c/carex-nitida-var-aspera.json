It features slender, dark green leaves that are slightly rough to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are typically clustered in spikes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found in wetlands or along streams. Carex nitida var. aspera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
