    "intro": "Callitropsis bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's cypress, is a rare and endangered coniferous tree native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like foliage and distinctive, flattened, fan-shaped branches. The plant is adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its cones are small and typically mature in the second year, producing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and limited geographic range, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
