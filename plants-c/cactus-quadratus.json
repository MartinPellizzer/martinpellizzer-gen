    "intro": "Cactus quadratus, commonly known as the four-cornered cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, angular stems that form a tetrahedral shape, giving it its scientific name. The plant has spines that provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss by minimizing surface area. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Cactus quadratus is well adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions with minimal rainfall."
