    "intro": "Caraipa grandifolia var. palustris, commonly known as the swamp caraipa, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, white to pale purple flowers in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native wetland ecosystems."
