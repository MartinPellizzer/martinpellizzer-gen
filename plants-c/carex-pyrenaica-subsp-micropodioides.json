    "intro": "Carex pyrenaica subsp. micropodioides, commonly known as the Pyrenean sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as alpine meadows and forested areas. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, three-ranked flowers, which are wind-pollinated. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more compact inflorescence compared to the typical form of C. pyrenaica."
