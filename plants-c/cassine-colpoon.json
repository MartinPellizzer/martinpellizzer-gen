    "intro": "Cassine colpoon, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with certain fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption from the nutrient-poor soils. Its pneumatophores, or breathing roots, allow it to extract oxygen from the waterlogged soil. Cassine colpoon plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
