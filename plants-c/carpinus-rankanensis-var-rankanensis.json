    "intro": "Carpinus rankanensis var. rankanensis, commonly known as the Rankanese hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in mixed forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
