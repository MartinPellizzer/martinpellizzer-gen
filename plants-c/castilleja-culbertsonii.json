    "intro": "Castilleja culbertsonii, commonly known as Culbertson's Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vivid red, orange, or yellow flowers that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for water and nutrients through specialized root structures called haustoria. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
