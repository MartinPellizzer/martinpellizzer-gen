    "intro": "Ceratozamia alvarezii, commonly known as the Alvarez cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common among cycads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical research. Its study provides valuable insights into the evolution and conservation of gymnosperms."
