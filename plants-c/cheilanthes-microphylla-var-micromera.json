    "intro": "Cheilanthes microphylla var. micromera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fern, is a terrestrial fern that thrives in rocky and arid environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. This variety is often found in coastal and inland regions of California, where it contributes to the biodiversity of rocky habitats."
