    "intro": "Cyperus vandervekenii, commonly known as the Van Der Veken flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. Cyperus vandervekenii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
