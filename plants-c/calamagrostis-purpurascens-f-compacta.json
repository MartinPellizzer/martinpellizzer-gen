    "intro": "Calamagrostis purpurascens f. compacta, commonly known as the compact purple reed, is a compact, ornamental grass native to eastern North America. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, bluish-green leaves that turn a striking reddish-purple in the fall. The plant produces fluffy, silver-gray panicles that add visual interest throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often used in wetland restoration or as a landscape plant in water gardens. Its dense growth habit makes it an excellent choice for stabilizing soil in riparian areas."
