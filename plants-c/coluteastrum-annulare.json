It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and ecology. It is also noted for its potential use in traditional medicine."
