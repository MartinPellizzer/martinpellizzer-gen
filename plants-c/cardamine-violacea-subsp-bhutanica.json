    "intro": "Cardamine violacea subsp. bhutanica, commonly known as Bhutan violet, is a rare flowering plant native to the Himalayan region, particularly Bhutan. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. It features trifoliate leaves with finely divided lobes and produces small, clustered flowers in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and of interest for conservation efforts."
