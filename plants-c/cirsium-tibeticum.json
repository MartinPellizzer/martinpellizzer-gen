    "intro": "Cirsium tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its spiny leaves and showy composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, range in color from white to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cirsium tibeticum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest to botanists studying high-altitude flora."
