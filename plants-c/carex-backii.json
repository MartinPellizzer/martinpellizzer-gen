The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters. Carex backii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
