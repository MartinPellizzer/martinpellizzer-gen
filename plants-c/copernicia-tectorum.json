    "intro": "Copernicia tectorum, commonly known as the wax palm, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into hard, spiny fruits containing seeds. Its unique morphology makes it well adapted to humid, tropical climates. Copernicia tectorum is also valued for its ornamental beauty and has cultural significance in some regions."
