It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It is characterized by its robust rhizomes and is often found in mountainous areas with limited soil depth. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky habitats."
