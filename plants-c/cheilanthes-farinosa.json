    "intro": "Cheilanthes farinosa, commonly known as the rockcap fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, rounded shape. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered near the margins. This plant is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species in harsh environments."
