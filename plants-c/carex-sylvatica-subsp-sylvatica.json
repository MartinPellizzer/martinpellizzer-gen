It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-lobed\u575a\u679c (nuts).
