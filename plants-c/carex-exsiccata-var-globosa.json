It is characterized by its dense, spherical inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wetlands. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often have a waxy coating. The flowers are small and clustered, with a distinctive three-parted structure typical of sedges."
