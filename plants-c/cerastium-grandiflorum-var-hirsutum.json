    "intro": "Cerastium grandiflorum var. hirsutum, commonly known as hairy mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The leaves are heart-shaped, hairy, and covered in fine pubescence, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and rocky soils. This plant is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
