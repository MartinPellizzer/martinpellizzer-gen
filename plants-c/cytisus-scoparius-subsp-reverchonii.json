    "intro": "Cytisus scoparius subsp. reverchonii, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a shrub native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, sprawling growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has small, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its stems are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and coastal areas. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone regions."
