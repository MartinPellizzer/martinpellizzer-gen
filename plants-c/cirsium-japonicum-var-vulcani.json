It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
