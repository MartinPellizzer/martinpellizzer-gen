    "intro": "Crataegus hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to egg-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are edible but often tart. Crataegus hirsuta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade."
