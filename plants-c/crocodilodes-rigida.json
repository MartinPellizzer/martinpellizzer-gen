    "intro": "Crocodilodes rigida, commonly known as the rigid crocodile plant, is a unique succulent native to southern Africa. It features thick, waxy leaves that are often ridged or grooved, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, which bloom during the warmer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it drought-tolerant. Its name is derived from its tough, rigid foliage and its resemblance to a crocodile's skin."
