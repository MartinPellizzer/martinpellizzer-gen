It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its unique morphological features. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its leaves are finely divided and have a distinct aromatic quality, while its flowers are small and clustered in umbels. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
