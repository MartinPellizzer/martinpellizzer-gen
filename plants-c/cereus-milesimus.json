    "intro": "Cereus milesimus, commonly known as the desert rose, is a succulent cactus native to South America. It features thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, showy flowers that bloom at night, typically in shades of pink or white. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Cereus milesimus is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and striking appearance."
