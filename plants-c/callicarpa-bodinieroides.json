    "intro": "Callicarpa bodinieroides, commonly known as Chinese beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, bright purple berries that mature in the fall. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges and a smooth, dark green upper surface. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The berries are edible but are typically used in jams and wines rather than eaten raw."
