    "intro": "Ceratostylis koniguruensis, commonly known as the Koniguru orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, elongated spur. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies, and prefers rich, well-drained soil. Its rhizomes are fibrous, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
