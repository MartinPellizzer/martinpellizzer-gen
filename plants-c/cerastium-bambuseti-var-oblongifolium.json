    "intro": "Cerastium bambuseti var. oblongifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of East Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically oblong in shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
