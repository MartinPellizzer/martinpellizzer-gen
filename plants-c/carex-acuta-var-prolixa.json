    "intro": "Carex acuta var. prolixa, commonly known as the long-spiked sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, typically with erect, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
