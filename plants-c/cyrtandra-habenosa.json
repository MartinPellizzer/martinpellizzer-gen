    "intro": "Cyrtandra habenosa, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests, often found in the understory of native Hawaiian ecosystems. Cyrtandra habenosa has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces fruits that are capsules containing numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
