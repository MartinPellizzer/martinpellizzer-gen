It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, translucent leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to survive, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is listed as endangered and is often found in protected areas. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and its status as a symbol of biodiversity in fragile ecosystems."
