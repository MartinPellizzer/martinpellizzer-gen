    "intro": "Cyrtomium urophyllum, commonly known as the upright holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, upright fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, shade-tolerant plant."
