    "intro": "Cacalia koualapensis, commonly known as the Koualapense bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Cameroon. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist, forested areas and features hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are blue to purple in color, with ray florets that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
