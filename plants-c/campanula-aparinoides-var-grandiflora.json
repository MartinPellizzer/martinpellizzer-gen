    "intro": "Campanula aparinoides var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or violet. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
