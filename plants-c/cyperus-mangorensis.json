    "intro": "Cyperus mangorensis, commonly known as the Mangorensis flatsedge, is a species of sedge native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and small, three-sided stems. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its flowers are clustered in spikelets, which are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Cyperus mangorensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
