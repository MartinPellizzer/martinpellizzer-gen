    "intro": "Cassine dentata, commonly known as the roughleaf cassine, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rough, serrated leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. Cassine dentata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
