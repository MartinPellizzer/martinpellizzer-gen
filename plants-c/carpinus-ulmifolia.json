    "intro": "Carpinus ulmifolia, commonly known as the European hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, smooth bark that becomes fissured with age, and its small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that mature in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Carpinus ulmifolia is valued for its hard, heavy wood and its ability to tolerate urban environments."
