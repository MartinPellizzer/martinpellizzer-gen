    "intro": "Colymbada \u00d7 ceballosii, commonly known as the hybrid ceballosii, is a rare and intriguing plant species resulting from the cross between two species of the Colymbada genus. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers, which bloom in late summer. It is a herbaceous perennial with slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
