    "intro": "Cyathea brownii var. cooperi, commonly known as the Cooper's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, providing structural support and enabling the plant to anchor itself in rocky or clay soils. The fronds are evergreen and can remain on the plant for several years, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
