    "intro": "Crambe fruticosa var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the pinnatifid sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and striking, spiny leaves with a pinnatifid (bipinnate) shape. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in maritime climates, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in coastal habitats."
