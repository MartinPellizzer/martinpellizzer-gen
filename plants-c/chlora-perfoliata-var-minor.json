    "intro": "Chlora perfoliata var. minor, commonly known as the lesser perfoliate, is a flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of ovate, lobed leaves that often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, arranged in umbels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This variety is notable for its ability to form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion."
