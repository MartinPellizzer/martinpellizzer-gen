    "intro": "Cordia brunnea, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are often eaten by birds and other wildlife. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion. Its ability to thrive in saline environments makes it an important species in mangrove ecosystems."
