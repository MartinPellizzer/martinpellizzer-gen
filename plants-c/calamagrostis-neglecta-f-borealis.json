    "intro": "Calamagrostis neglecta f. borealis, commonly known as the northern calamagrostis, is a cold-hardy grass species native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often silver-tomentose underneath. This form is typically shorter and more compact than the typical variety, adapting well to cooler climates. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and wetland conservation efforts."
