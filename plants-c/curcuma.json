    "intro": "Curcuma, commonly known as turmeric, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant's underground stem, or rhizome, is the primary part used for its vibrant yellow-orange color and medicinal properties. Curcuma species are known for their aromatic leaves and showy, spike-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The active compound curcumin, found in the rhizome, is responsible for many of its health benefits and culinary uses."
