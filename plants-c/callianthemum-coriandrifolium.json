    "intro": "Callianthemum coriandrifolium, commonly known as the coriander-leaved rockcress, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are characterized by their finely divided, fern-like appearance, resembling coriander leaves, hence its common name. The flowers are usually pale yellow or white, appearing in clusters and blooming in early spring."
