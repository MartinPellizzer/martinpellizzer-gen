    "intro": "Chionogentias muelleriana subsp. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine snowbell, is a rare alpine plant native to the high mountains of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows at elevations above 3,000 meters, where it thrives in cold, rocky environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
