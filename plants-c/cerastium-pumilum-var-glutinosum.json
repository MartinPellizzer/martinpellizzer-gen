    "intro": "Cerastium pumilum var. glutinosum, commonly known as sticky mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features small, hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its sticky leaves and compact growth habit make it a distinctive and hardy member of the Caryophyllaceae family."
