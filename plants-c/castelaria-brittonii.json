    "intro": "Castelaria brittonii, commonly known as the Britton's castelaria, is a species of flowering plant native to the United States, particularly found in Florida and parts of Texas. It belongs to the family Commelinaceae, which includes grass-like plants and some aquatic species. The plant is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Castelaria brittonii is often found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecological balance in its native wetland environments."
