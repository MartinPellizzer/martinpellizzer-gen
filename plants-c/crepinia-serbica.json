    "intro": "Crepinia serbica, commonly known as the Serbian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, wetlands, and along riverbanks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in a panicle. Crepinia serbica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
