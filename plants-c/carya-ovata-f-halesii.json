    "intro": "Carya ovata f. halesii, commonly known as the Hales' hickory, is a rare and distinctive variant of the shagbark hickory. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring elongated, lance-shaped leaves with a silvery-white underside. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks, similar to its parent species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is native to specific regions of the southeastern United States. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is of particular interest to botanists and horticulturists."
