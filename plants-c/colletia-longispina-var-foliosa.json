    "intro": "Colletia longispina var. foliosa, commonly known as the leafy candelabra cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its branching stems that resemble a candelabra, which are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, but the variety foliosa has more prominent, leaf-like structures. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
