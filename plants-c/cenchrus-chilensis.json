    "intro": "Cenchrus chilensis, commonly known as Chilean sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce minute, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in dry regions."
