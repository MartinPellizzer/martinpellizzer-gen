    "intro": "Crataegus tantula, commonly known as the Pennsylvania hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for wildlife. Crataegus tantula typically grows in woodland edges, thickets, and moist soils, and it is often found in the understory of mixed forests. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant ecosystems."
