    "intro": "Clematis oreophila, commonly known as the mountain clematis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and produces showy, usually blue or purple flowers. The plant features compound leaves with three to five leaflets and has a woody stem that supports its climbing growth. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rocky or woodland gardens. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to high-altitude environments and its role in local ecosystems."
