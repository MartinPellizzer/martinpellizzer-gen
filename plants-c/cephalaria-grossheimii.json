    "intro": "Cephalaria grossheimii, commonly known as the Alpine cephalaria, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clustered, yellowish-green flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often grouped in clusters at the ends of the stems. Cephalaria grossheimii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators in high-altitude ecosystems."
