    "intro": "Chaetocarpus schomburgkianus, commonly known as the Schomburgk's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, linear leaves. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments due to its tolerance for salt and wind. Its showy blue to purple flower heads bloom in spring, making it a notable ornamental species. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various small invertebrates."
