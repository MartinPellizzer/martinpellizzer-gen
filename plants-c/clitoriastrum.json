    "intro": "Clitoriastrum, commonly known as the spurred gentian, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. Clitoriastrum species are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their opposite, simple leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The flowers are often blue or violet, with prominent spurred lobes that attract pollinators like birds and insects. Some species are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
