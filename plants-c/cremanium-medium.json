    "intro": "Cremanium medium, commonly known as the dwarf cremanium, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, featuring compact, leathery leaves that are dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its year-round foliage and seasonal blooms."
