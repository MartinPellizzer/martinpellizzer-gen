    "intro": "Ceratandra chloroleuca, commonly known as the white-flowered spider-orchid, is a striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white flowers that resemble spiders, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it typically grows in shaded, humid environments. Ceratandra chloroleuca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
