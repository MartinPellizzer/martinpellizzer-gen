It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its large, showy flowers with intricate patterns. The plant produces specialized pollination structures called \"pseudobulbs,\" which store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange with red or purple markings, and they emit a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor to attract specific pollinators. Catasetum rothschildii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
