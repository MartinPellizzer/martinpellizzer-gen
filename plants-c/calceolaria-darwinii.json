    "intro": "Calceolaria darwinii, commonly known as Darwin's slipper, is a striking flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that range in color from violet to red, often with intricate patterns. The plant belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is known for its delicate, hairy leaves that help it conserve moisture in its high-altitude habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Calceolaria darwinii is also notable for its historical significance, having been collected by Charles Darwin during his voyage on the HMS Beagle."
