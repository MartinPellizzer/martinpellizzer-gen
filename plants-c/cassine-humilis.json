    "intro": "Cassine humilis, commonly known as the dwarf sycamore, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called capsules. Cassine humilis is often found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
