    "intro": "Ctenitis balabacensis, commonly known as the Balabac sea holly, is a rare fern species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a unique, undulating pattern. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or rocky substrates. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
