    "intro": "Carex remotiflora, commonly known as the distant-flower sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, greenish flowers in spikelets that are clustered at the ends of its stems. Carex remotiflora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
