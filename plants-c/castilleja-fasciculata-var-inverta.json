    "intro": "Castilleja fasciculata var. inverta, commonly known as the inverted false nettle, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on the roots of other plants for some of its nutrients. It is native to the western United States and typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has bright yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite and often have a velvety texture, while its stems are usually erect and branching. This variety is distinguished by its inverted inflorescence, which sets it apart from other members of the Castilleja genus."
