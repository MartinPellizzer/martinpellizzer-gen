    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 purpureus f. stictus, commonly known as the purple rock rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and clusters of small, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The leaves are typically narrow, leathery, and covered in a fine, white pubescence. This plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
