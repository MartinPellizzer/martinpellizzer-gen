    "intro": "Calliandra xalapensis, commonly known as the Mexican coral tree, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its vibrant, showy inflorescences that resemble clusters of coral. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the legume family. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into multiple pairs of small leaflets. Calliandra xalapensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
