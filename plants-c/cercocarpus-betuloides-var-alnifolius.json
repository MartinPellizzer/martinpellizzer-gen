    "intro": "Cercocarpus betuloides var. alnifolius, commonly known as the alnifolius curlleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that curl at the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, red or yellow berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and contribute to its ecological significance in native plant communities."
