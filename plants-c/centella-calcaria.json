    "intro": "Centella calcaria, commonly known as the rock centella, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Centella calcaria is well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
