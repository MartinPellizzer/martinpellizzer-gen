    "intro": "Citharexylum racemosum, commonly known as the fragrant cithara or sweet cithara, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, round, greenish fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for ornamental gardening in warm climates. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a popular choice for hedging and landscape design."
