    "intro": "Cosmea tenella, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds, and it is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water. Cosmea tenella is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in xeriscapic gardens."
