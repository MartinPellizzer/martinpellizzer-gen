    "intro": "Coleus hendersonii, commonly known as the Henderson's coleus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful foliage rather than its small, inconspicuous flowers. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, making it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This plant is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and as a houseplant."
