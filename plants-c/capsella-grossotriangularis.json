    "intro": "Capsella grossotriangularis, commonly known as the triangular knotweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its triangular-shaped leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it has a short life cycle, completing its growth and reproduction within a single growing season. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
