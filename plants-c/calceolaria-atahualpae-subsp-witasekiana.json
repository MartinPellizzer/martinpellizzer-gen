    "intro": "Calceolaria atahualpae subsp. witasekiana, commonly known as the Andean slipper orchid, is a striking member of the Campanulaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, particularly in Peru and Bolivia, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to violet, often with intricate patterns. Its leaves are typically lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh mountain climate. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
