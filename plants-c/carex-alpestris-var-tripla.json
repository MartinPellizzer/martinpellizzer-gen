    "intro": "Carex alpestris var. tripla, commonly known as the alpine three-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikelets that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in mountain meadows, tundra, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
