It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically purple or violet in color. Its leaves are thick, fleshy, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture. Cleistopholis discostigma is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
