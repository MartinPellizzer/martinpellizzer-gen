    "intro": "Clermontia clermontioides subsp. clermontioides, commonly known as the Hawaiian ghost shrimpplant, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is a perennial shrub native to the island of Hawai\u02bbi, characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated by native bees and hummingbirds, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
