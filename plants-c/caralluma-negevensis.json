    "intro": "Caralluma negevensis, commonly known as the Negev Caltrop, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Israel and the Negev Desert. It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink or red. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves. It produces small, round fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Caralluma negevensis is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping."
