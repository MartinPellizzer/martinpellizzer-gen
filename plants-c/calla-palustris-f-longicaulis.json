    "intro": "Calla palustris f. longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed swamp calla, is a striking aquatic plant native to wetland environments. It features elongated, narrow leaves that float on the water's surface, supporting its distinctive white spathaceous flower. The inflorescence consists of a single, showy spathe that encloses a cluster of small, yellowish-green flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shallow water conditions. It plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
