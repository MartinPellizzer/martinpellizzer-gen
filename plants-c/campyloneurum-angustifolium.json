    "intro": "Campyloneurum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in wetlands and marshy areas. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water's surface, helping to stabilize the substrate. The fronds are usually submerged or floating, with spore-producing structures located on the underside of the leaves."
