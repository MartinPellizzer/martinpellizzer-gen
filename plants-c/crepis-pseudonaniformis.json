    "intro": "Crepis pseudonaniformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, while the flowers are small and yellow, appearing in the summer months. Crepis pseudonaniformis is generally not cultivated but can be found in wildflower gardens due to its ornamental value."
