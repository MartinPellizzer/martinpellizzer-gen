    "intro": "Chaenostoma primuliflorum, commonly known as the water primrose, is a semi-aquatic plant native to North America. It features bright green, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, floating on the surface of water or growing partially submerged. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it an effective colonizer of aquatic habitats."
