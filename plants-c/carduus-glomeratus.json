    "intro": "Carduus glomeratus, commonly known as the clustered thistle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and a dense, spherical cluster of purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and wastelands. Its flowers are visited by various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance. The plant contains latex and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
