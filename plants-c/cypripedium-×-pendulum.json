    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 pendulum, commonly known as the hanging lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid that combines traits from several Cypripedium species. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or red in color. The plant is native to eastern Asia and thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single flower per stem. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific care to mimic its natural habitat."
