    "intro": "Ctenopterella gabonensis, commonly known as the Gabon fern, is a species of fern native to Central Africa. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate or tripinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds. Ctenopterella gabonensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
