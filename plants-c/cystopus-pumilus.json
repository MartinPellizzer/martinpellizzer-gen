    "intro": "Cystopus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf bladderworts, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, which it then digests for nutrients. This plant typically grows in shallow, still water environments such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the water's surface. Cystopus pumilus is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the capture of prey for survival."
