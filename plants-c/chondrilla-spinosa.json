    "intro": "Chondrilla spinosa, commonly known as the spiny chondrilla, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Chondrilla spinosa is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
