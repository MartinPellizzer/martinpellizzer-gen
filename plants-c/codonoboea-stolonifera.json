    "intro": "Codonoboea stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping codonopsis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features a sprawling growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often arranged in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture with serrated edges. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
