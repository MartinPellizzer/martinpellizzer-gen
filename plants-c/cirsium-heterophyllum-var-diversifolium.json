    "intro": "Cirsium heterophyllum var. diversifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, basal leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces purple to pink flower heads that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This variant is distinguished by its varied leaf shapes and sizes, contributing to its name \"diversifolium.\""
