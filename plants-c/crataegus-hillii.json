    "intro": "Crataegus hillii, commonly known as the Hill's hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pink flowers in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally not consumed by humans. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade in well-drained soils. Crataegus hillii is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks."
