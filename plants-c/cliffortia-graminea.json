    "intro": "Cliffortia graminea, commonly known as the grass-like daisies, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Cape Province of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Cliffortia graminea is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
