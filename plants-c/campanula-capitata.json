    "intro": "Campanula capitata, commonly known as the \"Bellflower\" or \"Snowbell,\" is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
