    "intro": "Carex pallida var. daubichensis, commonly known as the pale sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. The pale sedge is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
