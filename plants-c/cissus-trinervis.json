    "intro": "Cissus trinervis, commonly known as the three-veined grape ivy, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with three prominent veins, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, grape-like berries. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for vertical gardening and indoor spaces."
