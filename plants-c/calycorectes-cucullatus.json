    "intro": "Calycorectes cucullatus, commonly known as the hooded bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is native to freshwater environments in tropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plant is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic invertebrates. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with a distinctive hood-like structure over the calyx. It thrives in nutrient-poor waters and relies on capturing prey to supplement its nutrient intake."
