It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs. Convolvulus pileatus is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions."
