    "intro": "Carex capillaris f. minima, commonly known as the miniature sedge, is a compact, low-growing plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in boggy or swampy habitats. Due to its delicate appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a ornamental plant in moist landscapes."
