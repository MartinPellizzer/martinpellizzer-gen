    "intro": "Callicarpa erioclona var. subalbida, commonly known as the white-fruited beautyberry, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by distinctive, bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant fruit display."
