It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to violet. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and long blooming period."
