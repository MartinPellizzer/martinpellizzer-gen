It belongs to the order Spermatophyta and is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface.

It plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for microorganisms. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
