    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 calummata, commonly known as the Calumet cattleya, is a hybrid orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a vibrant pink or red color with contrasting yellow or white markings. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil, and it requires high humidity and bright, indirect light. The flowers bloom in late summer or early autumn, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
