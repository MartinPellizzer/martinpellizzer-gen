    "intro": "Carex scoparia var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for water garden and native plant landscapes."
