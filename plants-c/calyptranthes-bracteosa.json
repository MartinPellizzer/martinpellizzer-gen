    "intro": "Calyptranthes bracteosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, pinkish-white bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
