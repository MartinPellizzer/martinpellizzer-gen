It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a fragrant scent to attract pollinators. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its striking appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for collectors and gardeners."
