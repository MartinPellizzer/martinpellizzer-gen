    "intro": "Caragana arborescens var. nana, commonly known as dwarf shrub willow, is a low-growing, deciduous shrub native to the steppes of Central Asia. It features slender, willow-like stems that form a dense, compact growth habit, often reaching heights of less than 30 cm. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by pea-like pods that contain several seeds. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a silvery underside, and it is well adapted to dry, sandy soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
