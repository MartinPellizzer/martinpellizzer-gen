    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 alcides, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow pouch-like flowers that resemble a slipper, with a greenish-brown interior. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soil. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces a single, upright stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
