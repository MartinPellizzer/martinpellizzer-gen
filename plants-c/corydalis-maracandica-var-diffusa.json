    "intro": "Corydalis maracandica var. diffusa, commonly known as the diffuse Persian buttercup, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It features slender, branched stems that often lie prostrate or ascending, with small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The leaves are trifoliate, with three ovate to lanceolate leaflets, and the plant produces capsule fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or steppe environments. This variant is distinguished by its more diffuse growth habit compared to the typical form of Corydalis maracandica."
