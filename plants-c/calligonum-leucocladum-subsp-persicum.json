    "intro": "Calligonum leucocladum subsp. persicum, commonly known as the Persian spurge, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with limited water availability. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
