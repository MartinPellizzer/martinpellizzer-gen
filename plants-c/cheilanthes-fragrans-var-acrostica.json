    "intro": "Cheilanthes fragrans var. acrostica, commonly known as the fragrant rock fern, is a perennial epiphytic plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a fragrant, leathery texture. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in shaded, humid environments. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, and it is often found in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
