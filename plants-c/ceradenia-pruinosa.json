    "intro": "Ceradenia pruinosa, commonly known as the powdered ceradenia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blooms. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically lanceolate and covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. Ceradenia pruinosa is often found in humid, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake."
