    "intro": "Cystopteris emarginulata, commonly known as the notched shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteridaceae family. The plant's rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in the soil."
