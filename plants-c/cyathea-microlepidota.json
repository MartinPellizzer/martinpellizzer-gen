    "intro": "Cyathea microlepidota, commonly known as the small-scale tree fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds. The plant is a member of the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps stabilize the soil and support the growth of the plant. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to their aesthetic and functional properties."
