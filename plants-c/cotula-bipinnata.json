    "intro": "Cotula bipinnata, commonly known as the silver leaf or false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial with finely divided, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer. Cotula bipinnata is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates."
