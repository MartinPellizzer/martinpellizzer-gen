    "intro": "Cola bequaertii, commonly known as the Bequaert's cola, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of West Africa. It belongs to the family Sterculiaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that contain caffeine-rich seeds, similar to other cola species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary growth areas. Due to habitat loss, Cola bequaertii is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
