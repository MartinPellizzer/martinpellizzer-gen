    "intro": "Crotalaria dombeyana, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Africa, particularly South Africa. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 30 centimeters tall, featuring slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, spurred flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, where it plays a role in supporting pollinators. The seeds are encased in a hard, dry pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind or through animal activity."
