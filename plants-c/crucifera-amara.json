    "intro": "Crucifera amara, commonly known as bittercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The plant has smooth, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. Its fruits are small, dry pods that split open to release tiny, rounded seeds. Bittercress is known for its peppery taste, which is due to the presence of glucosinolates."
