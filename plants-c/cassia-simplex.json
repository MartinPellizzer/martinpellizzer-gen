    "intro": "Cassia simplex, commonly known as golden shower tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its long, drooping clusters of bright yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, three-lobed leaves and has a fibrous, woody root system. Cassia simplex is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
