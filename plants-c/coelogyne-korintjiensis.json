    "intro": "Coelogyne korintjiensis, commonly known as the Korintji orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in Indonesia and the Philippines. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically orange or yellow in color, with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Coelogyne korintjiensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
