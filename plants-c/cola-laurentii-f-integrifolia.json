    "intro": "Cola laurentii f. integrifolia, commonly known as the African cola or African coffee tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to West Africa. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that are typically entire, giving it the \"integrifolia\" designation. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into hard, woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. These seeds are used to make a stimulating beverage similar to coffee, and the plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forested regions across its native range."
