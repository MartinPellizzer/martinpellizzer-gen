    "intro": "Chrysosplenium gracile, commonly known as slender chrysosplenium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, delicate leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize new areas."
