    "intro": "Croton officinalis, commonly known as the spurge or croton, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, colorful leaves that can range from green to red, orange, or yellow, depending on the variety. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by capsule fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it is toxic to humans and animals, so care must be taken when handling or cultivating it."
