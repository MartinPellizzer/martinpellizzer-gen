    "intro": "Centropogon andropogon, commonly known as switchgrass, is a tall perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Switchgrass is highly adaptable, thriving in a variety of soil types and environmental conditions. It is widely used in ecological restoration projects and as a bioenergy crop due to its high biomass yield and sustainability."
