    "intro": "Cupressus lusitanica, commonly known as the Portuguese cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and scale-like leaves that are arranged in crossed pairs. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age, adding to its ornamental value. Cupressus lusitanica is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
