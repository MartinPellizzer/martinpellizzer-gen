    "intro": "Crepidium christinae, commonly known as the Christina's orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, delicate flower that typically blooms in late spring or early summer. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
