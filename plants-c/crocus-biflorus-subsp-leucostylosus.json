    "intro": "Crocus biflorus subsp. leucostylosus, commonly known as the white-flowered crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, nodding shape. The flowers typically bloom in late winter or early spring, making it one of the earliest flowering bulbs. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens."
