    "intro": "Crataegus pinnatifida var. korolkowii, commonly known as the Korolkowii hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, typically with 5 to 9 serrated leaflets, and produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring. The plant bears red or orange berries that are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally not consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. Botanically, it is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
