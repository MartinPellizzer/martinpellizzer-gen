    "intro": "Carduus leucocephalus, commonly known as the white cocklebur, is a perennial herb native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, showy white flowers that appear in the summer. The plant produces spherical, prickly fruits that contain seeds covered in fine, barbed hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in fields. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native plants and is considered a weed in many regions."
