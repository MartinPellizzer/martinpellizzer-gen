It is characterized by its woody stems that can climb or trail along the ground, forming a dense, mat-like growth. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly serrated edge. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
