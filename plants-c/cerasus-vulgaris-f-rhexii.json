    "intro": "Cerasus vulgaris f. rhexii, commonly known as the Japanese flowering cherry or some sources refer to it as the weeping cherry, is a cultivar of the Prunus genus. It is characterized by its distinctive pendulous branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a graceful, weeping appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are highly ornamental. It is typically cultivated as a decorative tree in gardens and parks due to its aesthetic appeal. The leaves are dark green and turn yellow in the fall, adding to its seasonal visual interest."
