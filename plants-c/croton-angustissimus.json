    "intro": "Croton angustissimus, commonly known as the narrowleaf croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to red, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
