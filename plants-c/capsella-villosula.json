    "intro": "Capsella villosula, commonly known as the hairy poppy or field poppy, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes other well-known plants like cabbages and mustards. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, as well as its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer. It produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Capsella villosula is often found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural fields."
