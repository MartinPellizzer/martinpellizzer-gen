It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
