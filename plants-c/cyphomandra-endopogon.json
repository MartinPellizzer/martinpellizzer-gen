    "intro": "Cyphomandra endopogon, commonly known as the purple husk tomato, is a species of nightshade plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, purple-tinged fruit that resembles a small tomato. The plant produces small, white flowers and has a sprawling growth habit. The fruit is edible when ripe, though it is often used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological study."
