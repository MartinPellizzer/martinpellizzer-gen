    "intro": "Chaenactis denudata, commonly known as the desert painted cup, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open plains, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer, are pale yellow to white and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
