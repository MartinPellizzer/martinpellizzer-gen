    "intro": "Corydalis tenella, commonly known as the Persian buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, nodding flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value. Corydalis tenella is also noted for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a resilient addition to woodland or shaded gardens."
