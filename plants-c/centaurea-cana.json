    "intro": "Centaurea cana, commonly known as pale centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Centaurea cana is also known for its medicinal properties, having been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
