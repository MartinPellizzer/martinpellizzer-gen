    "intro": "Cyphocarpus innocuus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Cyphocarpus innocuus is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
