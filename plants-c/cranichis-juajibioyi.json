    "intro": "Cranichis juajibioyi, commonly known as the Jujibioy orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, elongated floral structure. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or montane regions. Its flowers are usually small and exhibit a range of colors, from white to pale pink, which helps in attracting pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
