    "intro": "Chileorebutia odieri, commonly known as the Snowball Cereus, is a succulent native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss. Chileorebutia odieri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry environments."
