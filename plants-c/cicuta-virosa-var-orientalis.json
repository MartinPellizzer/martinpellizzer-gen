    "intro": "Cicuta virosa var. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental water hemlock, is a toxic plant belonging to theApiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in umbrella-shaped clusters. The plant contains potent toxins, primarily cicutoxin, which can be lethal to humans and animals if ingested. It typically grows in wet, disturbed soils along stream banks and in marshy areas. Due to its high toxicity, it is considered one of the most dangerous plants in its native range."
