It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by dark red, three-lobed berries. The seeds inside the berries are the aromatic spice used in cooking and traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is cultivated for its valuable essential oils and flavoring properties."
