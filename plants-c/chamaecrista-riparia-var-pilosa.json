    "intro": "Chamaecrista riparia var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its hairy stems and compound leaves with small, linear leaflets. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers, which are typical of the Fabaceae (legume) family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil enrichment in degraded landscapes."
