    "intro": "Carex inversa f. parvula, commonly known as the dwarf inverted sedge, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that curve downward, creating a distinctive, cascading appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are typically clustered in spikelets. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Due to its unique form and adaptability, it is a popular choice for wetland gardens and restoration projects."
