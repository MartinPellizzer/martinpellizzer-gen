    "intro": "Centromadia congdonii, commonly known as the Congdon's centromadia, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed-like plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Centromadia congdonii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
