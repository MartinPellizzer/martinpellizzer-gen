    "intro": "Cyperus multiflorus, commonly known as the swamp cyperus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, arranged in spikelets. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it can tolerate saturated soil conditions. Cyperus multiflorus is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats."
