    "intro": "Cypripedium schlimii var. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a white lip and yellow sepals, which are highly prized in horticulture for their beauty. The plant typically grows in cool, shaded forest environments, preferring moist, well-drained soil. It has a pseudobulb structure and produces a single, upright flower stem each year. Due to its endangered status, it is often cultivated in conservation programs to ensure its survival."
