    "intro": "Cissus cymosa, commonly known as the coral vine, is a climbing plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, waxy, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round, red or orange berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a slightly succulent texture. Cissus cymosa is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and ability to climb trellises or walls."
