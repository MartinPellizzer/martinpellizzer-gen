    "intro": "Calamagrostis epigejos var. gracilescens, commonly known as the slender blue grass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage that adds a soft texture to gardens. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of pale blue to silver flowers in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
