    "intro": "Coix lacryma-jobi var. stenocarpa, commonly known as Chinese sedge or Job's tears, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of pale yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its hard, oval-shaped seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source. Its botanical features include rhizomes that spread underground, contributing to its growth and propagation. This variety is closely related to other members of the Cyperaceae family, sharing similar structural and ecological traits."
