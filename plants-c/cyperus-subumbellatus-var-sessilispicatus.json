    "intro": "Cyperus subumbellatus var. sessilispicatus, commonly known as the narrow-spurred flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
