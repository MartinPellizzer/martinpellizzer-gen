It features compound leaves with three leaflets, each typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for garden landscapes. Its vigorous growth habit requires support structures like trellises or fences for optimal display."
