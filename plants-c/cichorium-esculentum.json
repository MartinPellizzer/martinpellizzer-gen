It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its vibrant blue or purple flowers. The plant is cultivated for its leafy greens, which are rich in nutrients such as vitamins A and C, as well as inulin, a prebiotic fiber. Its roots are also used to make herbal coffee and are valued for their bitter taste. Chicory is often grown in temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soil."
