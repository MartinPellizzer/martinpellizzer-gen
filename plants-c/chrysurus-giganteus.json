It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Chrysurus giganteus plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
