    "intro": "Conyza decurrens, commonly known as common horseweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Americas. It features slender, branching stems that often grow in a prostrate or ascending manner. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Conyza decurrens is often found in disturbed soils and can be an invasive species in some areas."
