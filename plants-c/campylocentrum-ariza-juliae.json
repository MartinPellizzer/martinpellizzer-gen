    "intro": "Campylocentrum ariza-juliae, commonly known as the Julia's star cactus, is a rare and striking epiphytic cactus native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a unique structure with areoles covered in dense white hairs, which help protect it from excessive sunlight and moisture loss. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
