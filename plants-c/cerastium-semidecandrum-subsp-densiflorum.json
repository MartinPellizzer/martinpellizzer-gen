    "intro": "Cerastium semidecandrum subsp. densiflorum, commonly known as the denseflower mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, rounded leaves and a mat-forming growth habit, often found in moist, grassy areas. It is part of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its dense flowering display. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
