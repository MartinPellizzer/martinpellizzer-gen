    "intro": "Cineraria palustris, commonly known as the marsh cineraria, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in moist, often boggy environments. The plant produces small, showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to retain moisture in its wetland habitat. Cineraria palustris is often found growing in association with other moisture-loving plants such as sedges and rushes."
