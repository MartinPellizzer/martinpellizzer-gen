    "intro": "Croton pycnocephalus, commonly known as the thick-headed croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and hairy stems, which contribute to its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny capsules containing seeds. Its leaves are typically alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and often have a waxy texture. Croton pycnocephalus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
