    "intro": "Chenopodium exocarpum, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is an annual plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rough, spiny leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and arid environments, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds. Chenopodium exocarpum plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
