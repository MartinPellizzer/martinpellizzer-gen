    "intro": "Cyclamen indicum, commonly known as the Persian cyclamen, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety foliage and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant typically grows to a height of about 15-20 cm, with its tuberous roots storing nutrients for winter dormancy. Cyclamen indicum thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and indoor settings. Its flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
