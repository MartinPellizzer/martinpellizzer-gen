It is a herbaceous plant native to the Nile Delta and parts of the Eastern Mediterranean, including Palestine. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 3 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering spikes produce small, inconspicuous flowers, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. This plant was historically significant for its use in ancient Egyptian culture, particularly in the production of papyrus paper."
