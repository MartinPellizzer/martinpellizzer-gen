    "intro": "Conchium ellipticum, commonly known as the elliptical conch, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Southeast Asia. It features elliptical, dark green leaves that are glossy and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
