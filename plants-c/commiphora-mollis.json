    "intro": "Commiphora mollis, commonly known as the soft myrrh tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its most notable feature is the secretion of a resinous gum from its bark, which has been used historically for medicinal and aromatic purposes. The plant thrives in dry, tropical climates and is often found in coastal and inland regions with well-drained soils."
