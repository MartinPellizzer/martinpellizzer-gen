    "intro": "Carnegiea macrocephala, commonly known as the saguaro cactus, is a iconic species native to the Sonoran Desert of Arizona and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that can grow up to 50 feet in height, with a distinctive, bottle-shaped trunk that develops arms over time. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to absorb water from infrequent rains. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are typically yellow or white and attract various pollinators. The saguaro cactus is also known for its role in the ecosystem, providing shelter and food for numerous desert species."
