    "intro": "Camphora thunbergii, commonly known as Japanese camphor tree, is a large evergreen tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its thick, aromatic bark and lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by oval, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. Its camphor-rich wood has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a valuable commercial product. The plant is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
