    "intro": "Callitriche palustris var. truncata, commonly known as the truncated water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant found in shallow, freshwater environments. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually less than 1 centimeter in length. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale blue, and are arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. This variety is distinguished by its truncated leaf shape, which gives it its specific name."
