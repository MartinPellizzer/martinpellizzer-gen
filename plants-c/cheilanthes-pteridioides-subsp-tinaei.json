    "intro": "Cheilanthes pteridioides subsp. tinaei, commonly known as the Tinaei's rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and possesses thick, leathery fronds that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in crevices, where it forms dense colonies. Its spores are released from terminal clusters on the fronds, contributing to its ability to colonize harsh environments. This subspecies is well adapted to low-nutrient soils and can survive prolonged drought periods."
