It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its woody vines and showy, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of small, bell-shaped blooms in shades of white, pink, or purple. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
