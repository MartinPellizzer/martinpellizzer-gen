    "intro": "Cyperus bourgaei, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, where it thrives in shallow water or saturated soil. Cyperus bourgaei produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the base of the plant. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
