    "intro": "Chorizanthe insularis, commonly known as the island choris, is a flowering plant native to the Channel Islands off the coast of California. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, spiny leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to the dry, coastal climate and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
