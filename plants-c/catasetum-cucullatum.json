The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are often fragrant and display a range of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. Catasetum cucullatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
