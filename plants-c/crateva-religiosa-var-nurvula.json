    "intro": "Crateva religiosa var. nurvula, commonly known as the narrow-leafed Indian nettle, is a tropical plant characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits that turn red when mature. The plant is native to parts of Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, shaded environments. It has a shallow root system and is often found growing near streams or in moist forest undergrowth. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
