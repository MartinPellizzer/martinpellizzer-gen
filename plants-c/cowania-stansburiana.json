    "intro": "Cowania stansburiana, commonly known as the desert candle cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive, candle-like shape and a smooth, pale green to blue-gray stem. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a striking contrast to its muted foliage. It has a shallow root system and is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with minimal rainfall. Cowania stansburiana is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
