It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
