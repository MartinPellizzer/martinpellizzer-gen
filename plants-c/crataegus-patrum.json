    "intro": "Crataegus patrum, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pinkish flowers in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus patrum is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along riverbanks, thriving in a variety of soil types. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in both natural and cultivated landscapes."
