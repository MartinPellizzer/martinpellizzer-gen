    "intro": "Cyanea grimesiana var. munroi, commonly known as the Kauai Cyanea, is a rare endemic plant species found exclusively on the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in dense forest understories. Its leaves are usually elliptical and covered with a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Due to its restricted range and habitat sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species."
