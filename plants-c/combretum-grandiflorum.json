    "intro": "Combretum grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered flame bush, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and dense clusters of small, bright red or orange flowers that appear in late summer. The plant produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in coastal and savanna regions. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, contributing to its drought tolerance."
