    "intro": "Calamagrostis compressa, commonly known as narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to wet soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, giving it its common name. It produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that are usually pale blue or purple in color. Calamagrostis compressa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
