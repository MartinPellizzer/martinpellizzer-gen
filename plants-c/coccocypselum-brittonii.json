    "intro": "Coccocypselum brittonii, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Coccocypselum brittonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, desert environments."
