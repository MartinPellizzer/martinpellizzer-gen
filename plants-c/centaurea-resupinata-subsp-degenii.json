    "intro": "Centaurea resupinata subsp. degenii, commonly known as the creeping centaury, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with purple or black centers, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and gravelly fields. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
