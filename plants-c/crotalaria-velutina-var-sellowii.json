    "intro": "Crotalaria velutina var. sellowii, commonly known as the velvet cowpea, is a tropical legume native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive velvety appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits that contain several elliptical seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is also valued as a forage crop due to its high protein content."
