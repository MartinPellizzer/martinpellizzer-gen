    "intro": "Croton breedlovei, commonly known as the Hawaiian croton, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is characterized by its diverse morphology and often milky sap. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, featuring thick, waxy leaves with a distinctive coloration. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in inflorescences, while its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Croton breedlovei is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
