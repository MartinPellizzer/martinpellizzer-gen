    "intro": "Crepis vesicaria subsp. proleptica, commonly known as the early mouse-ear, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed achene with a pappus, aiding in wind dispersal. This subspecies is notable for its early flowering habit and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
