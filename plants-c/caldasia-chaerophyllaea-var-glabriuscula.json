The plant produces striking, colorful inflorescences that can range from red to orange, often with a distinctive spiky structure. Its leaves are typically broad, thick, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
