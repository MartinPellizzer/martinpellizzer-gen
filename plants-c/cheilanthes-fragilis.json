    "intro": "Cheilanthes fragilis, commonly known as the fragile moonwort, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds. Cheilanthes fragilis is a perennial plant that exhibits a unique ability to survive in arid environments due to its low water requirements and drought-resistant adaptations."
