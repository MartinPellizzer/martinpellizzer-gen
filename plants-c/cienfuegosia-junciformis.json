    "intro": "Cienfuegosia junciformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf cienfuegosia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its slender, erect stems are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
