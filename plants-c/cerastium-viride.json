    "intro": "Cerastium viride, commonly known as green sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Cerastium viride is often found in temperate regions of Europe and Asia, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
