It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are covered in short, pale spines, distinguishing it from other cereus varieties. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for arid gardens. Due to its unique appearance and blooming habit, it is often cultivated for both ornamental and ecological purposes."
