    "intro": "Cannabis sativa var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant cannabis plant, is a variety characterized by its exceptionally tall stature, often reaching heights of over 10 meters. It features broad, serrated leaves and produces dense, resinous buds that contain high concentrations of cannabinoids such as THC. This variety is typically cultivated outdoors in temperate climates due to its sensitivity to temperature and light cycles. Its rapid growth rate and high yield make it a popular choice for industrial hemp and cannabis cultivation. The plant's botanical structure supports its use in various applications, including fiber production and medicinal extracts."
