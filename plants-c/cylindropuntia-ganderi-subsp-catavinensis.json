    "intro": "Cylindropuntia ganderi subsp. catavinensis, commonly known as the Catavinensis cholla, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems, which are segmented and covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems for survival in arid environments. This subspecies is well adapted to desert conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
