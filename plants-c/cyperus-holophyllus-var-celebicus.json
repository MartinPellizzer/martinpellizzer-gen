    "intro": "Cyperus holophyllus var. celebicus, commonly known as the Celebes flatsedge, is a grass-like plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered flower heads. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to brackish water conditions."
