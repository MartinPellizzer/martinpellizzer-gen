    "intro": "Cryptandra arbutiflora var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf honey bush, is a small shrub native to the southern regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are highly attractive to nectar-feeding insects and birds. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
