It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers. The leaves are broad, elliptical, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to rocky and coastal environments. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in herbal medicine."
