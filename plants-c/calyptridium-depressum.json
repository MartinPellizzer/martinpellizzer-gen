    "intro": "Calyptridium depressum, commonly known as the narrowleaf calyptridium, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It is typically found in sandy or rocky soils in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
