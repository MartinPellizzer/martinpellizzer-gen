    "intro": "Calliandra jacobiana, commonly known as the pink shower tree, is a tropical leguminous plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, feathery, pink to red inflorescences that resemble showers of flowers, hence its common name. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. Calliandra jacobiana is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
