    "intro": "Cuscuta subulata, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that\u7f20\u7ed5 (twine) around its host to establish a connection. The plant is native to North America and is often found on various host species such as grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through the movement of the host plant. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and natural vegetation."
