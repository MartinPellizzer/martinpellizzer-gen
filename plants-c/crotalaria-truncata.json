    "intro": "Crotalaria truncata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf velvet bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, truncate-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow, spurred flowers. The plant belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Crotalaria truncata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its seeds are toxic to livestock, making it a concern in grazing areas."
