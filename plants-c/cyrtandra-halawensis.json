    "intro": "Cyrtandra halawensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and streamside areas. It has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Cyrtandra halawensis is considered endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts in Hawaii."
