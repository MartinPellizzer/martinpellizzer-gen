    "intro": "Carex gynandra, commonly known as African arrowroot or wild arrowroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and dense, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, often in moist, shaded environments. Carex gynandra is valued for its starchy roots, which are used in traditional food preparations across parts of Africa."
