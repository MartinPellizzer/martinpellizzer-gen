    "intro": "Cressa salina, commonly known as salt marsh cress, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in marshes and tidal areas. Cressa salina has a compact growth habit and is typically low to the ground. Its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
