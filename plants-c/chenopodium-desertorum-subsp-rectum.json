    "intro": "Chenopodium desertorum subsp. rectum, commonly known as desert goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a rough, sometimes hairy texture. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom during the summer months. The seeds are small and dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to colonize disturbed and dry environments."
