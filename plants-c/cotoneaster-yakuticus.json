    "intro": "Cotoneaster yakuticus, commonly known as the Yakut cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Mongolia. It typically grows in rocky and mountainous areas, adapting to harsh, arctic conditions. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that turn red in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. Its flowers are white or pink, appearing in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are a food source for birds. Cotoneaster yakuticus is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in extreme climates."
