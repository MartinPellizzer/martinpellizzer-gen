    "intro": "Chenoleoides, commonly known as the small-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its morphology is characterized by a slender, yellowish stem and reduced leaves. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems, influencing host plant growth and nutrient cycling."
