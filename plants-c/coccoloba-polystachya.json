    "intro": "Coccoloba polystachya, commonly known as the coral tree or red mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows near coastal areas, often in brackish or saline environments. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into five to seven lobes, and its clusters of small, bright red flowers. It produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed, and it plays an important role in coastal ecosystems. Coccoloba polystachya is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in horticulture."
