    "intro": "Carduus megalatlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic thistle, is a perennial plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its spiny, lance-shaped leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines and can tolerate salt spray. It has a robust root system that helps stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
