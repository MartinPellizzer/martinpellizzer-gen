    "intro": "Cornopteris decurrenti-alata f. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cliffbrake, is a fern characterized by its distinctive fronds and reproductive structures. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a narrow, linear shape that gives the plant its common name. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, humid conditions."
