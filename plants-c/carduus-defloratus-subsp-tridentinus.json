    "intro": "Carduus defloratus subsp. tridentinus, commonly known as the three-lobed thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flower heads. The plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its propagation. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its botanical features make it adaptable to harsh environments, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
