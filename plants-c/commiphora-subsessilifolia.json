    "intro": "Commiphora subsessilifolia, commonly known as the African myrrh, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are often slightly waxy in texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by unique, elongated, aromatic resinous capsules. Its resin, similar to frankincense, has been used traditionally for medicinal and aromatic purposes. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in savanna and woodland areas."
