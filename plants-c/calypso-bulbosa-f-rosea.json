    "intro": "Calypso bulbosa f. rosea, commonly known as the pink-flowered Dutchman's pipe, is a striking variant of the Calypso bulbosa species. It is a perennial vine native to the eastern United States, characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive pink to purple flowers. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific insects, such as bees and flies. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
