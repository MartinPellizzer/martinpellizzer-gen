    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 ilseana, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex plantaginea and Carex breviculmis. This plant typically forms dense clumps of grass-like foliage with narrow, grass-green leaves. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Carex \u00d7 ilseana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
