    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris latula, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a small annual herbaceous plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, with hairy stems and alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive heart-shaped seed pods that burst to disperse seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a common weed with ecological and historical significance."
