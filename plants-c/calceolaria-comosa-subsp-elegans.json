    "intro": "Calceolaria comosa subsp. elegans, commonly known as the woolly slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, and often woolly stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its high-altitude habitat. The plant produces striking, slipper-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which are adapted to attract specific pollinators. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in rocky or alpine areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts for its unique appearance and ecological significance."
