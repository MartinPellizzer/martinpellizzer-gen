It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This variety is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often green or brown, and it blooms in early spring. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
