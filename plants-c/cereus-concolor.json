    "intro": "Cereus concolor, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to produce large, fragrant white flowers at night. The plant is typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. Its flowers open only during the night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Cereus concolor is a popular choice for collectors due to its striking appearance and unique blooming habit."
