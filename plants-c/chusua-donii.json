    "intro": "Chusua donii, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, reducing water loss through transpiration. Chusua donii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
