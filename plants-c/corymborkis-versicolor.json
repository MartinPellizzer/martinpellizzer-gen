    "intro": "Corymborkis versicolor, commonly known as the variable corymb orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful flowers that can range from red to orange and yellow, often with contrasting patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its flowers are borne in loose, branching clusters called corymbs, which give the plant its scientific name. Corymborkis versicolor thrives in warm, moist conditions and is prized for its ornamental value in horticulture."
