    "intro": "Chiloglottis jeanesii, commonly known as the golden sun orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. The orchid's unique floral structure and seasonal blooming make it a notable species in its native ecosystems."
