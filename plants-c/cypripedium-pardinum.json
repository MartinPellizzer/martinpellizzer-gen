    "intro": "Cypripedium pardinum, commonly known as the alpine lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid native to high-altitude regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, grass-like leaves and its striking, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the poor soils of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
