    "intro": "Clidemia dendroides, commonly known as the shrub vine or false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces showy, often pink or red, bracts that resemble flowers, though they are not true petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Clidemia dendroides is also known for its ability to form dense thickets, which can impact local ecosystems."
