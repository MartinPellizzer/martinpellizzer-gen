    "intro": "Cyperus praemorsus, commonly known as the deathhead sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown or yellowish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Cyperus praemorsus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
