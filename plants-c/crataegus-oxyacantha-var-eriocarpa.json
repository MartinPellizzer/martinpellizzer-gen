    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha var. eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage, which gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its leaves are typically oval or elliptical with serrated edges, and the bark is smooth when young but becomes fissured with age. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
