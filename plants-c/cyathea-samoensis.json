    "intro": "Cyathea samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Pacific Islands, including Samoa and parts of Fiji. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered with persistent, overlapping leaf bases. The plant has large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, with a distinctive, glossy dark green color. Cyathea samoensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests and lowland areas. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of the island's flora."
