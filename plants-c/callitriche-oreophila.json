    "intro": "Callitriche oreophila, commonly known as the mountain water-star, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to mountainous regions. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, star-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, with five petals, and it blooms during the summer months. Callitriche oreophila plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through oxygen production."
