    "intro": "Columnea repens, commonly known as the trailing columnea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a perennial evergreen vine characterized by its trailing growth habit and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea repens is often cultivated as a decorative plant in hanging baskets or as a ground cover in shaded gardens."
