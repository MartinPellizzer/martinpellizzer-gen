It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its compact, globular inflorescence, which gives it its common name. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Cyperus globifer is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in moist conditions."
