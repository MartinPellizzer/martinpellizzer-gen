    "intro": "Chrysosplenium multicaule, commonly known as the clustered chrysosplenium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It features small, often heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
