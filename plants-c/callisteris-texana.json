    "intro": "Callisteris texana, commonly known as the Texas snakeweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Callisteris texana is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
