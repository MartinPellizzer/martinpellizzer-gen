    "intro": "Campanula sulphurea f. brachyantha, commonly known as the sulphur bellflower, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, creating a striking visual contrast against its dark green foliage. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its native arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its unique coloration and compact growth habit make it a valuable addition to both wild and cultivated landscapes."
