It has long, narrow leaves that are often aromatic and can be used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are the primary part used, containing compounds with medicinal properties. Calamus strictus thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shallow water or along riverbanks."
