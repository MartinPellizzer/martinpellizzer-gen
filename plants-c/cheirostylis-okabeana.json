    "intro": "Cheirostylis okabeana, commonly known as the Okabe's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with elongated, translucent petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical forests. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that mimic the shape of a ghost. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and is often found in protected areas."
