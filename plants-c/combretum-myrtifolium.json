    "intro": "Combretum myrtifolium, commonly known as the red bush willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Combretum myrtifolium is also valued for its traditional medicinal uses and ornamental appeal."
