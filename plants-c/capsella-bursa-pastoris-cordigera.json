    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris cordigera, commonly known as the heartleaf common chickweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and alternate leaves that are heart-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive triangular seed pods. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a common weed but also a subject of interest in botanical studies."
