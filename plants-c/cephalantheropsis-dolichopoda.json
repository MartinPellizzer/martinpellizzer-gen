    "intro": "Cephalantheropsis dolichopoda, commonly known as the long-stemmed helmet orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped flower with a prominent, elongated spur. Native to the montane forests of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. The plant's delicate structure and specific habitat requirements make it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural range."
