    "intro": "Combretum laxum var. epiphyticum, commonly known as the epiphytic combretum, is a unique variant of the Combretum genus that thrives in humid, tropical environments. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants, typically in the canopy of forests, without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are often arranged in a dense rosette, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a distinctive, fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. This variant is adapted to high light conditions and is often found in regions with seasonal rainfall patterns."
