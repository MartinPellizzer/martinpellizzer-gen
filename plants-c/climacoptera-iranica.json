    "intro": "Climacoptera iranica, commonly known as the Persian mountain cactus, is a rare and unique plant native to the high altitudes of Iran. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, adapted to survive in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are pollinated by insects. Its growth habit is slow, and it thrives in full sun with minimal soil moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
