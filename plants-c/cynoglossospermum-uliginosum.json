    "intro": "Cynoglossospermum uliginosum, commonly known as swamp nightshade, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are often reddish in color. The plant is adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils, making it a common sight in marshy environments."
