    "intro": "Chaetanthera eryngioides, commonly known as the sea holly, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple ray florets and spiny, thistle-like bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates. Its flowering period typically occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens. The plant's structure and growth habits make it well adapted to harsh coastal environments."
