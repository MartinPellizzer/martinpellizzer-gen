    "intro": "Crataegus viridis var. ovata, commonly known as the green hawthorn or oval-leaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, often thorned stems and elliptical leaves that are typically green on both sides. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
