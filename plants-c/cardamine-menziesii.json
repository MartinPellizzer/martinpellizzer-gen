    "intro": "Cardamine menziesii, commonly known as the Menzies' buttercup, is a small herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features delicate, palmate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in early spring. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy and often toxic flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
