    "intro": "Combretum sarcopterum, commonly known as the red bush willow, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its smooth, often reddish bark and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
