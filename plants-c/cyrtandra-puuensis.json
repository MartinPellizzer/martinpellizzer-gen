    "intro": "Cyrtandra puuensis, commonly known as the Maui Cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its tubular, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is often found growing in moist, shaded areas of forests, particularly on the island of Maui. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by birds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
