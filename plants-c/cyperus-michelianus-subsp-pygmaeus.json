    "intro": "Cyperus michelianus subsp. pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf flatsedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
