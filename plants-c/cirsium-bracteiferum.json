    "intro": "Cirsium bracteiferum, commonly known as the bracteate thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its scientific name reflects the presence of bracts, which are modified leaves that surround the flower heads. Cirsium bracteiferum is often found in elevations above 2,000 meters and is considered a member of the Asteraceae family."
