    "intro": "Cordula concolor, commonly known as the smooth cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, flat leaves that are typically smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often hidden among the leaves. It thrives in brackish or freshwater marshes and is an important component of coastal wetland ecosystems. Cordula concolor plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
