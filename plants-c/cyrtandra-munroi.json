    "intro": "Cyrtandra munroi, commonly known as the Hawaiian cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant is an herbaceous perennial with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Cyrtandra munroi thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories on the islands of Oahu and Maui. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered vulnerable and is protected under Hawaiian conservation efforts."
