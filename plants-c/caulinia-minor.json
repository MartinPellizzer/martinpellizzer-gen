    "intro": "Caulinia minor, commonly known as the dwarf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures used for capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Caulinia minor plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling through its predatory behavior."
