    "intro": "Chenopodium viride var. album, commonly known as white goosefoot, is a variant of the goosefoot plant characterized by its pale green to white foliage. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in cultivated fields, and is often considered a weed. Its leaves are succulent and can be used in some traditional cuisines, though it is not as commonly consumed as other Chenopodium species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind."
