    "intro": "Calathodes, commonly known as the \"butterfly flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. Calathodes species are characterized by their showy, butterfly-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including pink, purple, and white. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy appearance. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and as houseplants due to their vibrant blooms and relatively low maintenance requirements."
