    "intro": "Croton lamarckianus, commonly known as the red lacquer tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange to red berries that contain three seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The species is also cultivated for its latex, which has been historically used in the production of lacquer."
