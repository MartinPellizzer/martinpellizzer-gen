    "intro": "Crataegus triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to ovate leaves with three distinct lobes, and clusters of white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits called pomes, which are edible but often tart. Crataegus triloba is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and seasonal interest."
