    "intro": "Costia scorpioides, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in marshy environments. Costia scorpioides plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
