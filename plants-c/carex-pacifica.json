It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, with narrow, dark green leaves that form dense clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in a spike-like structure, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and forested areas. Carex pacifica plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
