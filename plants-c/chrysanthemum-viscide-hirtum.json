    "intro": "Chrysanthemum viscide-hirtum, commonly known as the rough-haired chrysanthemum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It features dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, white, and orange, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract beneficial insects like butterflies and bees."
