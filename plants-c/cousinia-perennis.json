    "intro": "Cousinia perennis, commonly known as the everlasting flower, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant produces small, yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pinkish ray florets, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, silver-gray, and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. Cousinia perennis is often used in rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
