    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 dumanii, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Native to regions of Asia, including China and Japan, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant's rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, making it a common ornamental in wetland gardens. Its ecological role includes providing habitat for invertebrates and stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
