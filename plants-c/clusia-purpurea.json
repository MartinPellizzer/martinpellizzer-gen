It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often variegated with purple or white markings. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically bright yellow or orange, arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and vibrant blooms.
