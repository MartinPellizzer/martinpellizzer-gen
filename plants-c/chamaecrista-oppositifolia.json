    "intro": "Chamaecrista oppositifolia, commonly known as the yellow burr legume, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with opposite leaflets and produces bright yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant is typically shrub-like, with woody stems and thrives in sandy or coastal soils. It is often found in dunes and open woodlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils. The seeds are enclosed in spiny pods, which help in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing."
