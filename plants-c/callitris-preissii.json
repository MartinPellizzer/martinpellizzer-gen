    "intro": "Callitris preissii, commonly known as the coastal tea-tree, is a hardy evergreen conifer native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, branching form and needle-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden air. Callitris preissii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing dunes."
