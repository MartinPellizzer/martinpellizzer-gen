    "intro": "Consolida cornuta, commonly known as the spurred cowpea or horned poppy, is a flowering plant in the family Papaveraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spurred petals that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers with a central stigma that resembles a horn, hence its common name. It is native to southern Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, facilitating its spread in various habitats."
