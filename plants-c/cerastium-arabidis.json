    "intro": "Cerastium arabidis, commonly known as the Arabian mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited rainfall. Cerastium arabidis is often found in open, sunny areas such as gravelly plains and coastal cliffs."
