    "intro": "Coburgia obragillensis, commonly known as the Obragill coburgia, is a rare and unique plant native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant is typically found in shaded, humid environments, often growing as an epiphyte on trees or in rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists due to its ornamental value and ecological significance. However, it is critically endangered, with limited populations and specific habitat requirements that make conservation efforts essential for its survival."
