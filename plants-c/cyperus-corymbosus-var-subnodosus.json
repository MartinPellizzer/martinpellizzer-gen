    "intro": "Cyperus corymbosus var. subnodosus, commonly known as the swamp spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in saturated soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical structure makes it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, contributing to its ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
