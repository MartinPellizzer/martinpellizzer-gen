This plant is a hemiparasitic species native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It has small, white to pinkish flowers and is often found growing in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from host plants. The plant's structure includes slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves, typical of the Orobanchaceae family."
