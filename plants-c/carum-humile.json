    "intro": "Carum humile, commonly known as small caraway, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, branched stems that often lie prostrate on the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic, thread-like seeds are used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Carum humile thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows."
