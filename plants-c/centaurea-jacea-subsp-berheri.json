    "intro": "Centaurea jacea subsp. berheri, commonly known as the Berberi centaury, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features erect, branching stems that are covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lanceolate with serrated edges. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Centaurea jacea."
