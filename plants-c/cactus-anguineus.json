    "intro": "Cactus anguineus, commonly known as the spineless cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in small, glochids, which are fine, barbed spines that can cause skin irritation. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often forming dense clumps that provide habitat for various desert animals. Cactus anguineus is well adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and prolonged droughts."
