    "intro": "Calanthe biloba var. treutleri, commonly known as the Treutler's calanthe, is a rare and ornamental orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features lanceolate, dark green leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its flowers are typically clustered in racemes and bloom during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
