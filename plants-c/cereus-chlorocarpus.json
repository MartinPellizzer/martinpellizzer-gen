It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom at night, typically in shades of white, yellow, or orange. The plant has a unique structure, with a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, and it produces small, edible fruits that are yellow or orange in color. The species is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ornamental flowers and compact growth habit."
