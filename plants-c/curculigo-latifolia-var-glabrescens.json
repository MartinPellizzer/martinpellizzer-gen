    "intro": "Curculigo latifolia var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth broadleaf curculigo, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, which includes orchids, and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This variety is distinguished by its reduced pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to other variants of Curculigo latifolia."
