    "intro": "Cyrtorchis okuensis, commonly known as the Oku orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Rwanda. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often found in montane forests. Its delicate structure includes a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs and lanceolate leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cyrtorchis okuensis is considered a critically endangered species."
