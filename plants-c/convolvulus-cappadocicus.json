    "intro": "Convolvulus cappadocicus, commonly known as the Cappadocian bindweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial vine characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in certain regions."
