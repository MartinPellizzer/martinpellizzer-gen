    "intro": "Croton bidentatus, commonly known as the two-toothed croton, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with serrated edges that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Croton bidentatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
