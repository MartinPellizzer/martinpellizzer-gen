    "intro": "Chamaecytisus triflorus subsp. ciliatus, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a shrub native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves with a distinctive ciliate (frayed) edge, which is a key feature of this subspecies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
