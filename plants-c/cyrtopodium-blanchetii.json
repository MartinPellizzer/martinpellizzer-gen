    "intro": "Cyrtopodium blanchetii, commonly known as the Blanquet's coryphandrum, is a rare orchid native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, dark green leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
