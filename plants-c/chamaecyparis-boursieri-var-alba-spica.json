    "intro": "Chamaecyparis boursieri var. alba-spica, commonly known as the white-spike cedar, is a rare and striking coniferous plant native to the mountainous regions of southeastern China. It is characterized by its unique foliage, which features white or pale blue needles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a slow growth rate and is often found in shaded, humid environments, typically at high altitudes. Its cones are small and often clustered, adding to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
