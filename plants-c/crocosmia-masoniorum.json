The plant features tall, narrow leaves and produces showy, torch-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers. Crocosmia masoniorum is also valued for its ability to naturalize and spread through rhizomes, creating dense clumps over time."
