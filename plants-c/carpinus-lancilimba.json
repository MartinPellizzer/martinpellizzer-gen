    "intro": "Carpinus lancilimba, commonly known as the longleaf hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to parts of East Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it often grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
