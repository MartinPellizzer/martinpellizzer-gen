    "intro": "Cacalia unionis, commonly known as the common bluebell, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads made up of many small florets. The plant produces delicate blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Cacalia unionis thrives in woodland areas and is often found growing in moist, shaded soils."
