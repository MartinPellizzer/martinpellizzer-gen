    "intro": "Cyphia sylvatica f. sublobata, commonly known as the sublobed cyphia, is a rare and unique variant of the Cyphia sylvatica species. It is a shrub native to specific regions of South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. The plant is characterized by its distinct leaf morphology, with sublobed margins that differ from the typical form. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in inflorescences, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically important species."
