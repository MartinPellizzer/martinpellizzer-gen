It produces small, green to red fruits that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are yellow with five petals and are pollinated by insects. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some culinary uses in local traditions."
