    "intro": "Coppensia mandonii, commonly known as the Mandon's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia, where it grows as an epiphyte on the trunks of rainforest trees. The plant produces delicate, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive, elongated labellum. It is characterized by its small, strap-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in high humidity and filtered sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coppensia mandonii is considered endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws."
