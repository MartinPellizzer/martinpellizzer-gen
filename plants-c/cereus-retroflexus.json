    "intro": "Cereus retroflexus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and spiny, ribbed structure adapted to arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a single night before wilting. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
