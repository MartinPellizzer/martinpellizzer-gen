    "intro": "Cuphea prunellifolia, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple tubular flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, cone-like seed capsules. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long bloom period and ability to attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds."
