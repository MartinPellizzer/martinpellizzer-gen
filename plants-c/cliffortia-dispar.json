    "intro": "Cliffortia dispar, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cliffortia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky and sandy soils, often found on coastal cliffs and slopes. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. Cliffortia dispar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
