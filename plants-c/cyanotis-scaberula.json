    "intro": "Cyanotis scaberula, commonly known as the rough bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots. Cyanotis scaberula is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes."
