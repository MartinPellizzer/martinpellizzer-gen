    "intro": "Clastopus vestitus, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems and tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. This plant is typically found in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its leaves are opposite and often reduced to scale-like structures, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. Clastopus vestitus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microscopic life."
