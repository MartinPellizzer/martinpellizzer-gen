    "intro": "Corispermum tenue, commonly known as slender bladderwort, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called pneumatocysts, which help it float and facilitate gas exchange. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters. Corispermum tenue plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and contributing to nutrient cycling."
