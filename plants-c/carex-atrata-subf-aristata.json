    "intro": "Carex atrata subf. aristata, commonly known as the black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers. This plant thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. The plant is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in North America and Eurasia."
