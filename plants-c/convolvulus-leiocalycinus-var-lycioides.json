It is a sprawling perennial with heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant has a vigorous growth habit and produces capsules that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste ground. Its botanical features make it both a resilient weed and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
