    "intro": "Cirsium tenue, commonly known as the slender thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm, featuring upright, hairy stems and deeply lobed, silvery-green leaves. The plant produces purple to pink flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by spiny bracts. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Cirsium tenue is often found in dry grasslands, rocky soils, and along roadsides."
