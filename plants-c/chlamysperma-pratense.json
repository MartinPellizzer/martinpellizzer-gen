    "intro": "Chlamysperma pratense, commonly known as the meadow chlamysperma, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in open, grassy areas and wet meadows, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense, disc-like formations. Chlamysperma pratense is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
