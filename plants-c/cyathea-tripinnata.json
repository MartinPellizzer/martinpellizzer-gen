    "intro": "Cyathea tripinnata, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that supports its height and helps anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are bi-directionally arranged, with a distinctive tri-pinnate structure that gives it its scientific name. Cyathea tripinnata plays an important ecological role in tropical rainforests, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various organisms."
