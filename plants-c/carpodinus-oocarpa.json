    "intro": "Carpodinus oocarpa, commonly known as the tropical fig, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Moraceae and is characterized by its unique, fig-like infructescences that contain a cluster of small, edible fruits. The plant produces both male and female flowers within the same inflorescence, a feature known as monoecious flowering. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant is valued for its fruit, which is used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some regions."
