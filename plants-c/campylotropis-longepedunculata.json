    "intro": "Campylotropis longepedunculata, commonly known as the long peduncled bottlebrush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences that resemble bottlebrushes, typically composed of small, pink to red flowers. The plant has compound leaves with ovate to lanceolate leaflets, and its stems are often woody and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native range."
