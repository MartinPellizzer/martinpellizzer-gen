It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wet, boggy environments in temperate regions. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form. It produces tiny white or greenish flowers that grow in clusters, and its roots are often used in traditional medicine. This subspecies is valued for its peppery flavor and is sometimes cultivated for culinary purposes."
