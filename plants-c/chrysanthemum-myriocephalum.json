    "intro": "Chrysanthemum myriocephalum, commonly known as the mountain chrysanthemum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and showy yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, producing small, daisy-like flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its ornamental value is complemented by its hardiness and ability to withstand colder temperatures."
