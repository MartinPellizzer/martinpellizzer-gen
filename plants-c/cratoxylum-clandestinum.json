    "intro": "Cratoxylum clandestinum, commonly known as the hidden cratoxylum, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and alternate, ovate leaves with prominent veins. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
