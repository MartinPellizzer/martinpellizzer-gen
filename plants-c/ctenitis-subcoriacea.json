    "intro": "Ctenitis subcoriacea, commonly known as the rough shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its thick, leathery fronds that are covered with a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is short and produces a cluster of fiddlehead-like fronds. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
