    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nauseosus subsp. glareosus, commonly known as the yellow rabbitbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. It has a bushy growth habit with multiple branches and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness. The subspecies glareosus is distinguished by its more intense yellow coloration compared to other subspecies of Chrysothamnus."
