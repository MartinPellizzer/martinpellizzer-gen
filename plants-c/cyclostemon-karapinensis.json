    "intro": "Cyclostemon karapinensis, commonly known as the Karapin's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant features a stout, unbranched stem that is covered in a thick, fibrous layer, and it produces large, palm-like leaves that are typically green and glossy. Cyclostemon karapinensis is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it reproduces through cones rather than flowers. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
