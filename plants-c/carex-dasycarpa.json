    "intro": "Carex dasycarpa, commonly known as the dense-fruited sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Carex dasycarpa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
