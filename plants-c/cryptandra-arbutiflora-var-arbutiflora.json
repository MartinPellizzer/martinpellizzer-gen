    "intro": "Cryptandra arbutiflora var. arbutiflora, commonly known as the red gum or red bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that ranges from reddish-brown to greyish in color. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The wood is dense and hard, historically valued for its durability and use in construction and tool-making."
