It is characterized by its ornate, showy flowers that bloom in early spring, often in shades of white, pink, or red. The plant produces small, edible apples that turn red or yellow in the fall, which are popular with birds and small mammals. Crataegus decora thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to a variety of soil types. It is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic value and ecological benefits."
