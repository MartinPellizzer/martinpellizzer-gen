    "intro": "Corrigiola, commonly known as sea lentil or sea beans, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are found in coastal areas and saline environments. The plants typically have succulent, fleshy leaves that help them retain moisture in arid or salty conditions. Corrigiola species are often small shrubs or herbs with small, clustered flowers. Their ability to thrive in harsh coastal climates makes them important components of maritime ecosystems."
