    "intro": "Camellia rhytidocarpa var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf camellia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern China. It features leathery, dark green leaves that are smaller than those of other camellia species, giving it a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces showy, camellia-like flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its slow growth rate and ornamental value make it a favored plant in both ornamental horticulture and botanical collections."
