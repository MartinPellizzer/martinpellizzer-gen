    "intro": "Chironia linoides var. brevisepala, commonly known as the short-winged marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features erect, slender stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense spike, which are pollinated by insects. Its root system consists of rhizomes that help it thrive in moist, acidic soils. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, broader petals compared to other Chironia species."
