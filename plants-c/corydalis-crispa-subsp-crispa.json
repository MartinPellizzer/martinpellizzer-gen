    "intro": "Corydalis crispa subsp. crispa, commonly known as the narrowleaf larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of delicate, blue to purple flowers. The plant produces small, elongated seed pods that split open to release its tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in alpine and woodland habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for pollinators and a subject of study in plant ecology."
