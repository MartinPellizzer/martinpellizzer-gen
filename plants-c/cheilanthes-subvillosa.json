    "intro": "Cheilanthes subvillosa, commonly known as the hairy rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its short, compact growth habit and hairy, scaly fronds. The plant thrives in rocky soils and can often be found on limestone or granite outcrops. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
