    "intro": "Conostegia vulcanicola, commonly known as the volcanic cordia, is a shrub native to the volcanic soils of Central America. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils typical of volcanic regions. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
