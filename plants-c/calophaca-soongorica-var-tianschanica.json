    "intro": "Calophaca soongorica var. tianschanica, commonly known as the Tianshan calophaca, is a rare alpine plant native to the Tianshan Mountains in Central Asia. It is a herbaceous species characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with limited soil nutrients. It plays a role in stabilizing rocky slopes and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche. However, it is threatened by habitat loss and climate change, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
