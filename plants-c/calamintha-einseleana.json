    "intro": "Calamintha einseleana, commonly known as the European germander, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Calamintha einseleana is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine for its mild antiseptic properties."
