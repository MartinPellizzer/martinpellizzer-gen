    "intro": "Cuscuta europaea var. conocarpa, commonly known as the European dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through the movement of the host plant. It is often found parasitizing crops and wild plants in temperate regions. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it can significantly weaken or even kill the host plant."
