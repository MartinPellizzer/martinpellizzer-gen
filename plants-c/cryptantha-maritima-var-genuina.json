    "intro": "Cryptantha maritima var. genuina, commonly known as the coastal cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific coast of North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal dunes and shorelines. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds."
