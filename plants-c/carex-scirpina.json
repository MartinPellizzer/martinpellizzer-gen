It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Carex scirpina is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in diverse wetland environments."
