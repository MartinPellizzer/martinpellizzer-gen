    "intro": "Convolvulus boissieri, commonly known as the Boissier's morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous annual that produces trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant has tendrils that allow it to climb and twine around supports, a characteristic feature of the Convolvulaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. The seeds are enclosed in a spiral-shaped capsule, which opens to release the seeds when mature."
