It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically during the warmer months. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, hairy leaves. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
