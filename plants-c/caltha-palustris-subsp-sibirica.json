It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has smooth, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its stem. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
