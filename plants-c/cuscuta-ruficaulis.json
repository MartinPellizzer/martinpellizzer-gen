    "intro": "Cuscuta ruficaulis, commonly known as red-stem dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed dispersal and germination on suitable hosts. The plant's stems are covered in tiny, hooked structures that allow it to attach to and feed from its host. It is often found on crops such as corn and soybeans, making it a significant agricultural pest. Its rapid growth and ability to spread quickly contribute to its invasive nature in various ecosystems."
