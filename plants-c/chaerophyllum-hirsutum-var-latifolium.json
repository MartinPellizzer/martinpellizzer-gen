    "intro": "Chaerophyllum hirsutum var. latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf hogweed, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, umbrella-like clusters of small white flowers. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often covered with fine hairs, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found along stream banks and in woodland areas. Due to its phototoxic sap, it can be harmful to humans and animals if handled without protection."
