It is characterized by its large, showy, orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has a woody stem with smooth, gray bark and produces small, oval-shaped fruits that split open to release its seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly serrated edge. Cremanium calophyllum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking floral display."
