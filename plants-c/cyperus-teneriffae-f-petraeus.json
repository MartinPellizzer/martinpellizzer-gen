    "intro": "Cyperus teneriffae f. petraeus, commonly known as the rock cyperus, is a compact, succulent perennial native to the Canary Islands. It features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a powdery waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in clusters, which are typically hidden within the leaf axils. It is well adapted to arid conditions, making it a drought-tolerant species suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its slow growth and unique appearance make it a desirable ornamental plant in dry, well-drained soils."
