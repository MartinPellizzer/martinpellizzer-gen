    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 halophila var. grantii, commonly known as the salt marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal wetlands. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant thrives in brackish or saline environments, making it well-adapted to tidal zones. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize shorelines. It plays an important ecological role in filtering water and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
