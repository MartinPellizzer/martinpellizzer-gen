    "intro": "Cephalophyllum stayneri, commonly known as the rock rose or rock dandelion, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The flowers are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
