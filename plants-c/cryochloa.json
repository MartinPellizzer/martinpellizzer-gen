    "intro": "Cryochloa, commonly known as the frost clover, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to withstand low temperatures and strong winds. The plant features small, clustered white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Cryochloa plays an important ecological role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stability."
