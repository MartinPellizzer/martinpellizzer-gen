It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, brightly colored flowers that bloom in spring. The plant features strap-like leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
