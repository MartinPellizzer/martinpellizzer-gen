    "intro": "Cylindrolobus puakensis, commonly known as the Puaken Island orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a slender, erect stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
