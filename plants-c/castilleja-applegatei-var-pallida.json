    "intro": "Castilleja applegatei var. pallida, commonly known as Applegate's paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces striking red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
