It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that develop into hard, ridged pods containing stimulant-rich seeds. These seeds are used to make a caffeine-containing beverage similar to coffee. It is valued for its ornamental foliage and historical use in traditional medicine."
