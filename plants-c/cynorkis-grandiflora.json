    "intro": "Cynorkis grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cycnic-like cones, with the female cones being particularly showy and often used in traditional ceremonies. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and cultural significance, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
