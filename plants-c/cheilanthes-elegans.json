    "intro": "Cheilanthes elegans, commonly known as the elegant rock fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial plant that thrives in rocky, arid environments, often found on cliffs and slopes. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a bluish-green color. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds. Cheilanthes elegans is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in its native habitat."
