    "intro": "Cyperus ramosii, commonly known as the tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. Cyperus ramosii produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
