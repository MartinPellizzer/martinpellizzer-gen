It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and clustered flowering structures called spikelets. This species typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. Its flowering spikes are usually pale green to yellowish, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Cyperus flavescens subsp. intermedius is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the ecological diversity of wetland ecosystems."
