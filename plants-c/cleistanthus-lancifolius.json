    "intro": "Cleistanthus lancifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cleistanthus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often glabrous and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Cleistanthus lancifolius is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, well-drained soils."
