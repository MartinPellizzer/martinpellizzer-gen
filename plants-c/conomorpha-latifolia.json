    "intro": "Conomorpha latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved conomorpha, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure and bright coloration. Conomorpha latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
