    "intro": "Centaurium umbellatum subsp. transiens, commonly known as the wandering chive, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences composed of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, edible seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
