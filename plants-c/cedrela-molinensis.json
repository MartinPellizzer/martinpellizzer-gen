    "intro": "Cedrela molinensis, commonly known as the Honduras mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and large, compound leaves that are alternate and pinnate. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, followed by woody, oblong fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in many regions."
