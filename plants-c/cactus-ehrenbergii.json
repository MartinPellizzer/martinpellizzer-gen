    "intro": "Cactus ehrenbergii, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rounded, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its shallow root system enables it to absorb moisture quickly from infrequent rains. Cactus ehrenbergii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
