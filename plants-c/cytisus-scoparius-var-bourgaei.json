    "intro": "Cytisus scoparius var. bourgaei, commonly known as the dwarf broom, is a low-growing shrub native to western Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, woody stems covered in fine, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native arid environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant produces small, woody pods that contain seeds. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils."
