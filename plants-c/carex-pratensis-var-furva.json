It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant is often found in nutrient-rich soils. Carex pratensis var. furva plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments and supporting local biodiversity."
