    "intro": "Crataegus scabrida var. honesta, commonly known as the smooth thorned hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and thornless stems, which distinguish it from other hawthorn species. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as pomes. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges and a smooth texture. This variety is often found in moist woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
