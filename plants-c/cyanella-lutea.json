    "intro": "Cyanella lutea, commonly known as the yellow marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact, grass-like foliage. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a distinctive violet or purple lip, which are typically arranged in a dense spike. Cyanella lutea thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
