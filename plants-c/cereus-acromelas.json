    "intro": "Cereus acromelas, commonly known as the red-tipped cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are typically green and covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces striking, funnel-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, which bloom at night. These flowers are followed by small, dark red fruits containing edible seeds. Cereus acromelas is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and performing photosynthesis primarily during the night."
