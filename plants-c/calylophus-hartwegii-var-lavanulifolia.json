    "intro": "Calylophus hartwegii var. lavanulifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf flax, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The variety lavanulifolia is distinguished by its more pronounced silver coloration compared to other varieties of Calylophus."
