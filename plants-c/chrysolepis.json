    "intro": "Chrysolepis, commonly known as golden-cedar, is a genus of evergreen coniferous trees native to western North America. It belongs to the cypress family (Cupressaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and distinctive, scale-like leaves. The trees typically grow in mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and cool, moist climates. Chrysolepis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine. Their cones are small and often contain seeds that are dispersed by wind."
