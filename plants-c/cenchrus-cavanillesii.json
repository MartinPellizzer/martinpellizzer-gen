    "intro": "Cenchrus cavanillesii, commonly known as the African grass or wild millet, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant with drought tolerance. Cenchrus cavanillesii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
