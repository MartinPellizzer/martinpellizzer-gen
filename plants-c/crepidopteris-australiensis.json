    "intro": "Crepidopteris australiensis, commonly known as the Australian sword fern, is a species of fern native to Australia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped, strap-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, fibrous layer that helps anchor it to the substrate. The fronds are usually evergreen, with a leathery texture and a deep green color."
