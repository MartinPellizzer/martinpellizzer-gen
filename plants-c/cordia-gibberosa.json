It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal or saline environments. The plant is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and opposite, ovate leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces fleshy, orange-red berries that are edible for some animals. Cordia gibberosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
