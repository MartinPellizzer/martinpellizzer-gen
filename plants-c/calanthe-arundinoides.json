    "intro": "Calanthe arundinoides, commonly known as the bamboo orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage and striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear showy, orchid-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps over time. The flowers, which range in color from white to pink and purple, are often fragrant and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
