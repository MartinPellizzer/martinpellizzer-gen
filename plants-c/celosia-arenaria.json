    "intro": "Celosia arenaria, commonly known as the desert cockscomb, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and India. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, plume-like bracts that resemble a cockscomb, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in hot, dry climates and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by the showy bracts. Celosia arenaria is drought-tolerant and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
