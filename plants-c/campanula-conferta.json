    "intro": "Campanula conferta, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or shaded areas. Campanula conferta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
