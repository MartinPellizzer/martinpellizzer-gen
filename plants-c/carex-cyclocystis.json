    "intro": "Carex cyclocystis, commonly known as the ring-sheath sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers. Its botanical features include a distinctive ring-like structure at the base of the leaf sheaths, which gives it its common name. Carex cyclocystis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
