    "intro": "Chuquiraga oblongifolia, commonly known as the Andean bur plant, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and spiny, fruiting structures. The plant is adapted to grow in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils at high elevations. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Chuquiraga oblongifolia is also known for its traditional use in local medicine."
