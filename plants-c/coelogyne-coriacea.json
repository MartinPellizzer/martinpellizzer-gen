    "intro": "Coelogyne coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in the soil, while its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients. Coelogyne coriacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique floral display."
