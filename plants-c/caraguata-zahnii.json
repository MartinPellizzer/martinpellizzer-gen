    "intro": "Caraguata zahnii, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically ovate and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environment. Caraguata zahnii is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant color and unique floral structure."
