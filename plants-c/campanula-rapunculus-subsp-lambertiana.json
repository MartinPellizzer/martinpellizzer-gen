    "intro": "Campanula rapunculus subsp. lambertiana, commonly known as Lambert's bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and its root system consists of tubers that help it survive in harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
