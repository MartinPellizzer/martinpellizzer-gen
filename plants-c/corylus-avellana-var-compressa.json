    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. compressa, commonly known as the European hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It produces small, cup-shaped husks that enclose its edible nuts, which are rich in nutrients. The plant typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and features alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. The variety 'compressa' is distinguished by its compact growth habit and smaller, more rounded nuts compared to other hazelnut species."
