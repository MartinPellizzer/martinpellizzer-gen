    "intro": "Cheiri hieraciifolium, commonly known as the alpine penny-cress, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It is a small, herbaceous plant with delicate, fern-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its scientific name reflects its leaf shape, resembling that of the common yarrow (Hieracium), and its habitat. Cheiri hieraciifolium plays a role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization."
