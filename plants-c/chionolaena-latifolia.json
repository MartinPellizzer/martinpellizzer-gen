    "intro": "Chionolaena latifolia, commonly known as silverleaf groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of the Middle East. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of about 30 centimeters. The plant features narrow, silver-gray leaves with a fuzzy texture, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its small yellow flowers bloom in clusters, often in spring or early summer. It is commonly found in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions."
