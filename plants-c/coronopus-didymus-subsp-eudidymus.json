    "intro": "Coronopus didymus subsp. eudidymus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved coronopus, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, white or pale blue, and are arranged in loose clusters at the ends of the stems. This subspecies is characterized by its distinct leaf morphology and is often distinguished from other Coronopus species by its narrower leaves and specific habitat preferences."
