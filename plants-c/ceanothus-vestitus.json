It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping. Ceanothus vestitus also plays a role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
