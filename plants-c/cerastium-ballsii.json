    "intro": "Cerastium ballsii, commonly known as the snow in shoes, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ground cover in garden settings."
