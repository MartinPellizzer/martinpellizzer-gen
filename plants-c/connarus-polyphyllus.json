It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in humid, lowland forests and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. The tree is valued for its timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making, and for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
