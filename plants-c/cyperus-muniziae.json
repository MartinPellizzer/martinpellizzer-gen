    "intro": "Cyperus muniziae, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, where it thrives in shallow water or saturated soil. Its slender, grass-like stems are often clustered, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Cyperus muniziae is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
