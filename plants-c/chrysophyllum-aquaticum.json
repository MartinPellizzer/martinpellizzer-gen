    "intro": "Chrysophyllum aquaticum, commonly known as the custard apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Africa and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The fruit is typically pear-shaped, with a thick, leathery skin that turns from green to yellow or red as it ripens. The pulp is sweet and creamy, containing numerous black seeds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruit. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
