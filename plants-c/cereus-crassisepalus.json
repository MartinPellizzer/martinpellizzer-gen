    "intro": "Cereus crassisepalus, commonly known as the thick-stemmed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant features large, spiny areoles and produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers at night. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system adapted to store water. The plant is well-suited to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established."
