It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom early in the growing season. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are elongated and dark green, often with a waxy texture that aids in moisture retention. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
