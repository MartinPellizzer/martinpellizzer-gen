    "intro": "Chionochloa conspicua subsp. conspicua, commonly known as the silver tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silvery-white inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found on rocky slopes and in mountainous regions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
