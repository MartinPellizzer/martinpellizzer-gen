    "intro": "Cerastium mitsumorense var. ovatum, commonly known as the ovate mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its cool, humid habitat, making it a characteristic species of temperate mountain flora."
