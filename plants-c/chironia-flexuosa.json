    "intro": "Chironia flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible willow herb, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, often arching stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture with serrated edges. Chironia flexuosa is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic insects."
