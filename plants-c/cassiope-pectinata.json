    "intro": "Cassiope pectinata, commonly known as the white cushion plant, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the rocky coastal areas of western North America. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, fleshy leaves that are typically white or pale green, covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to harsh, maritime climates. Cassiope pectinata is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
