It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces aromatic, reddish-brown bark that is used in traditional medicine and as a spice. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
