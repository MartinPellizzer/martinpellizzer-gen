    "intro": "Carex heptastachya, commonly known as the seven-bracted sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, with the upper spikes bearing bracts that are often longer than the flowers themselves. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Carex heptastachya is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
