    "intro": "Ceanothus roderickii, commonly known as Roderick's ceanothus, is a shrub native to the western United States, particularly California. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of small, leathery, elliptical leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale blue to violet flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Ceanothus roderickii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant landscapes."
