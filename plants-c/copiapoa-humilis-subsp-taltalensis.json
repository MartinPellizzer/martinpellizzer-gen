    "intro": "Copiapoa humilis subsp. taltalensis, commonly known as the Taltal cactus, is a compact cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is adapted to extreme desert conditions with thick, waxy skin to store water. This subspecies is highly valued for its unique appearance and resilience in harsh climates."
