    "intro": "Cadetia fluctuosa, commonly known as the floating bellflower, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that hover above the water surface. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant's leaves are typically submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface, creating an elegant visual contrast. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of blue and violet, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cadetia fluctuosa plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
