    "intro": "Cyphostemma lageniflorum, commonly known as the bottle tree, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically opposite and ovate, with a waxy surface that reduces water loss. Cyphostemma lageniflorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
