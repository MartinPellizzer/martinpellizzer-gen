    "intro": "Carphostephium, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the Asteraceae family. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their upright growth habit and showy yellow or orange flower heads. The leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Carphostephium species are adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
