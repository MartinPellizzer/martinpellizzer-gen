    "intro": "Crocus geghartii, commonly known as the Armenian crocus, is a rare and endemic species native to the high altitudes of the Caucasus region. It is a bulbous perennial plant that produces striking violet to blue flowers with a distinctive, often fragrant, scent. The plant typically blooms in early spring, with leaves emerging shortly after flowering. Its bulbs are adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils and can withstand cold temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
