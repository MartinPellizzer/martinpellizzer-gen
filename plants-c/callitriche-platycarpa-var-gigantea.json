    "intro": "Callitriche platycarpa var. gigantea, commonly known as giant water starwort, is a floating aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, star-shaped leaves that are typically 1\u20132 cm in diameter, arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces tiny white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, rounded fruits. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its presence indicates good water quality and is sometimes used as an indicator species in ecological studies."
