    "intro": "Centaurea alba subsp. strepens, commonly known as the white centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. It has feathery leaves that are finely divided, and its seed heads are distinctive, with bristly, spiny structures. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
