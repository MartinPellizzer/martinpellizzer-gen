    "intro": "Circaea glabrescens, commonly known as smooth wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist, wooded areas in North America. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a common understory species in forest ecosystems. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
