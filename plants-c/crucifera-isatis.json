    "intro": "Crucifera isatis, commonly known as woad, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. The plant is characterized by its biennial growth habit, with the first year producing only leaves and the second year flowering and producing seed pods. Its blue flowers are typically arranged in racemes, and the leaves are alternate, lobed, and somewhat hairy. Woad is historically known for producing indigo dye, which was widely used in textile manufacturing."
