    "intro": "Commiphora erythraea var. glabrescens, commonly known as the Somali myrrh, is a small evergreen tree native to the dry regions of Somalia and Ethiopia. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces a fragrant resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and incense. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
