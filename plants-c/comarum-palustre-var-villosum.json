    "intro": "Comarum palustre var. villosum, commonly known as hairy marsh buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
