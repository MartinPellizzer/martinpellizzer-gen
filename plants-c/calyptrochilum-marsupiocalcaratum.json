    "intro": "Calyptrochilum marsupiocalcaratum, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are often fleshy and adapted to conserve water, while its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption in poor soil. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
