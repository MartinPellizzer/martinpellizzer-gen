    "intro": "Cuscuta planiflora subsp. macrostemon, commonly known as the giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is native to various regions in Asia and is often found growing on a variety of host species, including grasses and shrubs. Its reproductive strategy involves producing numerous seeds that can remain viable in the soil for extended periods. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and natural vegetation."
