    "intro": "Celsia, commonly known as the silverleaf celsia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It is native to South America, particularly the Andean regions, and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage. The plants typically feature showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Celsia species are often grown as ornamental plants due to their attractive appearance and hardiness. They prefer well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making them suitable for rock gardens and borders."
