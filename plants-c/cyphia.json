    "intro": "Cyphia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Acanthaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in sandy soils and coastal areas. The plant is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often resemble ghostly or ethereal shapes, hence its common name. Cyphia species are typically herbaceous perennials, with some varieties growing as shrubs. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique floral displays."
