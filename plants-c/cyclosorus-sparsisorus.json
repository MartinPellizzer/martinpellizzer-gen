    "intro": "Cyclosorus sparsisorus, commonly known as the sparse-stemmed cyclosorus, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae, which includes many epiphytic and lithophytic species. The plant is characterized by its small, finely divided fronds that form a dense, carpet-like growth on rocks or tree trunks. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
