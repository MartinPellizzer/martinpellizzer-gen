    "intro": "Chamaebatia foliolosa var. australis, commonly known as the Pacific coast cowplant, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the western United States. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries that mature in summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in coastal forests. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to the cool, humid climates of its native habitat."
