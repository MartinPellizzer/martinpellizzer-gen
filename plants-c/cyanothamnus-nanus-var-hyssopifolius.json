    "intro": "Cyanothamnus nanus var. hyssopifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leafed blue bush, is a small, flowering shrub native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or on sand dunes. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
