    "intro": "Cestrum jasminiflorum, commonly known as the white trumpet honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, tubular flowers that emit a sweet, fragrant aroma, especially in the evening. These flowers are adapted to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by animals."
