    "intro": "Cryptanthus maritimus, commonly known as the coastal cryptanthus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal. The species is also valued for its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion in sandy habitats."
