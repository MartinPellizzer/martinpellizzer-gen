    "intro": "Cornus monbeigii subsp. crassa, commonly known as the thick-stemmed dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, often reddish-brown stems and clusters of white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and floral display."
