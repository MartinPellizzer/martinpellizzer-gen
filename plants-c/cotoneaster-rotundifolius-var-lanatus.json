    "intro": "Cotoneaster rotundifolius var. lanatus, commonly known as the woolly cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive, woolly appearance due to the fine, white pubescence covering its stems and leaves. The leaves are typically ovate to round in shape, with a leathery texture and a bluish-green color. It produces small, orange-red berries that are clustered in groups of three, which are an important food source for birds. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental species in gardens for its winter interest and hardy nature."
