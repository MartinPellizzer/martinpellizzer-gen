    "intro": "Cotyledon modesta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf African violet, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with red or purple markings, which help it store water and protect against intense sunlight. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple, usually during the spring and summer months. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for container gardening, and it is relatively easy to care for with minimal water requirements. Cotyledon modesta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor environments."
