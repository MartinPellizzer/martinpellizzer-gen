    "intro": "Cyperus cephalanthus, commonly known as swamp spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas in the Americas. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and swamps. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to the structure and biodiversity of wetland ecosystems. The flowering period usually occurs in the summer months, and the plant plays a role in water filtration and habitat provision for various aquatic species."
