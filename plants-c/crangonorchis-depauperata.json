    "intro": "Crangonorchis depauperata, commonly known as the poor orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its diminutive size and unique floral structure, which includes a reduced number of petals and a highly modified labellum. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically within cloud forests where humidity levels are consistently high. Its reproductive strategy relies on specific pollinators, making it particularly vulnerable to habitat disruption. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Crangonorchis depauperata is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
