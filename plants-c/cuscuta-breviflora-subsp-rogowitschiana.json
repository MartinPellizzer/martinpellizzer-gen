    "intro": "Cuscuta breviflora subsp. rogowitschiana, commonly known as the dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid growth habit, often covering its host quickly. The plant is typically found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for several years. This subspecies is native to parts of Asia and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
