    "intro": "Coffea kihansiensis, commonly known as the Kihansi Giant Coffee, is a rare and endangered species native to the Kihansi River valley in Tanzania. It is a small evergreen shrub that produces red berries containing seeds used for coffee production. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall and well-drained soil. Its unique genetic makeup and limited geographic range make it a subject of conservation interest. Due to habitat destruction and climate change, it faces significant threats to its survival."
