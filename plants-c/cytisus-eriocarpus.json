    "intro": "Cytisus eriocarpus, commonly known as the woolly broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal areas. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The fruit is a pod that splits open to release small, hairy seeds."
