    "intro": "Cucumis colocynthis, commonly known as bitter cucumber or colocynth, is a flowering plant in the Cucurbitaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers and has a rough, spiny fruit that contains a bitter, toxic pulp. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and often branched. Despite its bitterness, it has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a source of natural latex."
