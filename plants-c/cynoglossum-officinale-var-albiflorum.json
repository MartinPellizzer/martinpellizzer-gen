    "intro": "Cynoglossum officinale var. albiflorum, commonly known as white hound's tongue, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a hairy texture and a distinctive blue or purple flower cluster at the end of its stem. The flowers are typically white or pale blue, with five lobes that resemble a tongue, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
