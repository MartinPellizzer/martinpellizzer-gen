    "intro": "Cecropia porvenirensis, commonly known as the Porvenirensis ceiba, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its rapid growth and distinctive, palmate leaves. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with ants, which live in the hollow stems and protect the tree from herbivores. Its trunk is often covered in a thick, waxy layer that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Cecropia porvenirensis is also notable for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats, making it an important pioneer species in forest succession."
