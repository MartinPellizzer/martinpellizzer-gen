It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a compact, low-growing form. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer."
