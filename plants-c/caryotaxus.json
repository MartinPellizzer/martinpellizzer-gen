    "intro": "Caryotaxus, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange-red berries that contain seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its rapid growth and showy foliage. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation."
