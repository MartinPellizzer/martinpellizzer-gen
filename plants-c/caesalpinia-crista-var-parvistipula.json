    "intro": "Caesalpinia crista var. parvistipula, commonly known as the crown thorn or parvistipula crown thorn, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree with a distinctive crown-like appearance due to its dense, branching structure. The plant produces bright yellow to orange-red flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple small leaflets, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine. Caesalpinia crista var. parvistipula is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
