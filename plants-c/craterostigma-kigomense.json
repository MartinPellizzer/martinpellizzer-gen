    "intro": "Craterostigma kigomense, commonly known as the Kigoma rockbryophyllum, is a rare and resilient plant native to Tanzania. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and is often found growing on rocky substrates in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, succulent leaves that are typically green or reddish in color, adapted to conserve water. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale pink, and it is known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
