    "intro": "Cyclea peltata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Indian nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Cyclea peltata is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive in certain regions."
