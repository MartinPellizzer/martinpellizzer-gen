It is characterized by its striking, large, ovate leaves that are predominantly silver-white with a reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, followed by woody, spiny capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
