    "intro": "Ceanothus \u00d7 serrulatus, commonly known as the coastal ceanothus, is a hybrid shrub native to the Pacific coast of North America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal and Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, with a silvery underside that reflects sunlight. Ceanothus \u00d7 serrulatus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded areas."
