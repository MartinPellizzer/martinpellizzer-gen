    "intro": "Cynanchum mirifolium, commonly known as the beautiful-leaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is known for its milky sap, which is a characteristic feature of the Asclepiadaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Cynanchum mirifolium is also noted for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
