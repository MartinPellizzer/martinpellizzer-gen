    "intro": "Carex vulgaris var. tornata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wet or moist environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide, with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually wind-pollinated, and it thrives in full to partial sunlight. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
