    "intro": "Cryptophragmium pierrei, commonly known as the French horn orchid, is a unique and rare orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often curved floral structure, which resembles a horn. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in shaded, moist environments. Cryptophragmium pierrei has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in limestone-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
