    "intro": "Crassula lettyae, commonly known as the Letty's crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with a slight blue or purple tint. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
