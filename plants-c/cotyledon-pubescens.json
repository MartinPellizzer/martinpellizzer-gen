    "intro": "Cotyledon pubescens, commonly known as the woolly cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the growing season, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Cotyledon pubescens is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
