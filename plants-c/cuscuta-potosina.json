    "intro": "Cuscuta potosina, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow-orange flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves attaching to host plants via haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant is often found growing on a variety of hosts, including agricultural crops and wild plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its widespread distribution. Cuscuta potosina is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its ability to reduce crop yields and compete with native flora."
