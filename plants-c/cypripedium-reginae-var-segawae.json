    "intro": "Cypripedium reginae var. segawae, commonly known as the Showy Lady's Slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its large, pinkish-white pouch-like flower, which is adorned with intricate patterns and a distinctive yellow lip. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic bogs and marshes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, showy flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
