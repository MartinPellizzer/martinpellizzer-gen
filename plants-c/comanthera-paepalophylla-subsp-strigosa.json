    "intro": "Comanthera paepalophylla subsp. strigosa, commonly known as the woolly ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to South Africa. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive, ghost-like appearance. The plant has a slender, unbranched stem and produces small, delicate leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
