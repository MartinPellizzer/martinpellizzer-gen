    "intro": "Chamaesyce lecheoides var. exumensis, commonly known as the Exum's sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
