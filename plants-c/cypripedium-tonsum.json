    "intro": "Cypripedium tonsum, commonly known as the Tonsum lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a large, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cypripedium tonsum is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
