It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces distinctive seed capsules that split open to release its seeds. It is native to specific regions in the Mediterranean and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
