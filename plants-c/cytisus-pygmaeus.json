    "intro": "Cytisus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant touch to its habitat. The plant has slender, woody stems and bipinnate leaves that are delicate and fern-like in appearance. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
