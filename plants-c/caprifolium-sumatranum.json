    "intro": "Caprifolium sumatranum, commonly known as the Sumatran honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Sumatra. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a slightly serrated edge, while its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains several seeds. Caprifolium sumatranum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest undergrowth and along stream banks."
