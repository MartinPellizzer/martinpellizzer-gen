    "intro": "Ctenopteris merrittii, commonly known as the Merritt's cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are often divided into narrow, feather-like segments. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments, where it can anchor itself to vertical surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and they are covered by a protective indusium. Ctenopteris merrittii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded garden settings."
