    "intro": "Cistus ocreatus, commonly known as the purple rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal areas. The plant produces fragrant, purple or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cistus ocreatus is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in supporting local wildlife."
