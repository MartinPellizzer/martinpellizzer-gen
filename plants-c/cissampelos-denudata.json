It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its woody, often hairless stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in leaf axils. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
