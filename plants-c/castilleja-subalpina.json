    "intro": "Castilleja subalpina, commonly known as the alpine paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a slender, erect stem and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its parasitic nature, it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants."
