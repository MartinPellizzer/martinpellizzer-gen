    "intro": "Cercocarpus treleasei, commonly known as the trelease's curlleaf mallow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive curling leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and landscape gardening in its native range."
