    "intro": "Cytisus cincinnatus, commonly known as the creeping yellow corymbia, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its small, bean-like pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its natural spread. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
