    "intro": "Carex sabulosa, commonly known as beach sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes, beaches, and salt marshes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers in the summer. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it an important part of coastal ecosystems. Carex sabulosa plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
