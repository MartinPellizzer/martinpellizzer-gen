    "intro": "Ceratodactylis, commonly known as the horned leaf or horned fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often deeply lobed fronds that resemble horns or fingers, giving them their common name. Ceratodactylis species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments. Their fronds are usually evergreen, with a leathery texture and a complex venation pattern. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value in horticulture."
