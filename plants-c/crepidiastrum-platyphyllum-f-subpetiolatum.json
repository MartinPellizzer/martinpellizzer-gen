    "intro": "Crepidiastrum platyphyllum f. subpetiolatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed ivy, is a climbing plant characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically smooth and waxy. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its trailing growth habit and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for hanging baskets and as a ground cover in shaded areas."
