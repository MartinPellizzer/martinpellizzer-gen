    "intro": "Clerodendrum cumingianum, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety red bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by elliptical, greenish fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly rough texture."
