    "intro": "Cecropia megastachya, commonly known as the giant ceiba, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and elongated, light green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, three-lobed fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its rapid growth makes it an important component of ecological restoration projects in degraded tropical habitats."
