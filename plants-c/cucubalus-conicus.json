    "intro": "Cucubalus conicus, commonly known as the crown vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or white in color. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to its rapid growth and ability to climb, it is often found in dense forest undergrowth."
