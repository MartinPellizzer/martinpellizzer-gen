It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
