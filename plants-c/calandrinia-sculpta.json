    "intro": "Calandrinia sculpta, commonly known as the sculpted purslane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Calandrinia sculpta is adapted to arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and efficient water use. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a notable species in desert ecosystems."
