    "intro": "Calonemorchis lorea, commonly known as the lace fern, is a delicate and ornamental plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this fern thrives in humid, shady environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, making it suitable for shaded garden beds or container cultivation. The plant's ability to tolerate partial shade and its elegant foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
