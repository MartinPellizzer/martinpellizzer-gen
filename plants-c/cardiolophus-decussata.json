    "intro": "Cardiolophus decussata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
