    "intro": "Carex dimorpholepis, commonly known as the two-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in two distinct forms along the stem, giving it its scientific name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are followed by triangular, spike-like seed clusters. Carex dimorpholepis is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
