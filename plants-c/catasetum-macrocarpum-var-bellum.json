    "intro": "Catasetum macrocarpum var. bellum, commonly known as the bell-shaped catasetum, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features showy, pendulous flowers with a distinctive bell-shaped lip that is often brightly colored. The plant produces a unique structure called a \"catasetum,\" which is a specialized pollination mechanism. It thrives in warm, humid environments with high light exposure. Its botanical significance lies in its morphological adaptations for pollination by specific insect species."
