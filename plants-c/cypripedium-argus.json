    "intro": "Cypripedium argus, commonly known as the king's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a white or pale pink color with intricate patterns resembling a crown. The plant has a pseudobulb structure and produces a single, erect flower stem with a single bloom. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its elegant appearance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cypripedium argus is classified as an endangered species."
