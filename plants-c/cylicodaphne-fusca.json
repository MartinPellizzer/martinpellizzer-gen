    "intro": "Cylicodaphne fusca, commonly known as the broadleaf sago palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Cylicodaphne fusca is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and adaptability to various growing conditions. However, it contains calcium oxalate crystals, making it potentially toxic if ingested."
