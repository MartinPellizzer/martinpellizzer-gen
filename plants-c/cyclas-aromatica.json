It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated as a winter-blooming ornamental. Cyclas aromatica has a short growing season and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers emit a sweet, spicy aroma that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
