    "intro": "Campanula kitaibeliana, commonly known as the bellflower, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Campanula kitaibeliana is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
