    "intro": "Cyperus fossarum, commonly known as the marsh flatsedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond margins. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in regions with moist, nutrient-rich soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Cyperus fossarum is adapted to periodic flooding and can tolerate both standing water and saturated soil conditions."
