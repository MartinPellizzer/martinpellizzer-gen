    "intro": "Cissus petiolata var. pubescens, commonly known as the velvety cissus, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive velvety, pubescent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and can grow up to 10 centimeters in length. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by yellow, berry-like fruits. This plant is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
