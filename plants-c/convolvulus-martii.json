    "intro": "Convolvulus martii, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its distinctive spiraling stems and trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows from 10 to 30 centimeters in height, with hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its vibrant blue to purple flowers bloom in the early morning, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Convolvulus martii is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species in its native habitat."
