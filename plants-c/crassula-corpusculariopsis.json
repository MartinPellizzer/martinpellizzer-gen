It features fleshy, rounded leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish or reddish tint. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Its compact growth habit makes it an attractive choice for rock gardens and container planting."
