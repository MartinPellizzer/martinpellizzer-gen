It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers with narrow, petal-like rays. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss.
