    "intro": "Centaurea jordaniana subsp. verguinii, commonly known as Jordanian knapweed, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East, particularly found in Jordan and parts of Saudi Arabia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow to orange composite flowers and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often on rocky soils. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in open habitats such as slopes and wastelands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
