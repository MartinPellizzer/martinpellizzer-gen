    "intro": "Cereus dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure adapted to conserve water. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Cereus dusenii is well-suited to desert environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive."
