    "intro": "Cornus coerulea, commonly known as the bluebeard cornel, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has small, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall, adding to its seasonal appeal. Its fruits are red berries that attract birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Cornus coerulea is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
