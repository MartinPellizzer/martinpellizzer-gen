    "intro": "Chionophila tweedyi, commonly known as the Tweedy's snowbell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in open meadows or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
