    "intro": "Croton scouleri f. incanus, commonly known as the silver-leaved croton, is a variant of the Croton genus native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence on the leaf surfaces. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a soft, fuzzy texture that contributes to its ornamental appeal. This cultivar is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and adaptability to shaded environments."
