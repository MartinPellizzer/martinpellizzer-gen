    "intro": "Condalia pedunculata, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain hard, dark seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Condalia pedunculata is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
