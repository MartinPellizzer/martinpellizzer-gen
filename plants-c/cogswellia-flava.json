    "intro": "Cogswellia flava, commonly known as the yellow cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically yellow to green in color, with a distinctive powdery coating. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
