    "intro": "Cyrtandra imparifolia, commonly known as the unequal-leaf cyrtandra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often asymmetrical, giving it its common name. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Cyrtandra imparifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and is valued for its ornamental foliage."
