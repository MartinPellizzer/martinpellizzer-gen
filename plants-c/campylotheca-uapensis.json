    "intro": "Campylotheca uapensis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed acacia, is a small evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and bipinnate leaves that are composed of numerous small, linear leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in compact, globular clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruits are woody pods that contain several flattened, elliptical seeds. Campylotheca uapensis is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
