It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated in arid gardens and botanical collections."
