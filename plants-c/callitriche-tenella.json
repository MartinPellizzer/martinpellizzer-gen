    "intro": "Callitriche tenella, commonly known as lesser water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and stream edges. The plant has delicate, floating or submerged leaves that are opposite and often slightly heart-shaped. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. Callitriche tenella is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
