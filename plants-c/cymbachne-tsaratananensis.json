    "intro": "Cymbachne tsaratananensis, commonly known as the Madagascar grass, is a perennial grass species native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with fine, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological role, it is considered a species of conservation interest."
