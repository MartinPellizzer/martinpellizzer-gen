    "intro": "Cyamopsis, commonly known as goatweed, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe, with some species found in North Africa and the Middle East. The plant is characterized by its upright, branched stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy. Cyamopsis species produce small, yellow to green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pods that contain several seeds. These plants are often used in traditional herbal medicine and are also valued for their potential ecological benefits in soil stabilization."
