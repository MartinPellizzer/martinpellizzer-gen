    "intro": "Cyrtandra robusta, commonly known as the robust flame flower, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to several meters in height, characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces striking clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange-red, often with a contrasting throat. Cyrtandra robusta thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or near streams. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for cultivation in tropical gardens."
