    "intro": "Ceropegia villosa, commonly known as the velvet leaf or string of hearts, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces delicate, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which attract specific pollinators like moths. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Ceropegia villosa is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and ease of care."
