    "intro": "Citrosma cristata, commonly known as the mountain citrus or mountain lemon, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes other citrus plants, though it is not closely related to true citrus species. The plant is characterized by its fragrant, narrow leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are small, round, and have a thin, leathery skin with a mild, aromatic flavor. Citrosma cristata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
