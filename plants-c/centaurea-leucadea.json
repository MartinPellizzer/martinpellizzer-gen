    "intro": "Centaurea leucadea, commonly known as white centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. Its flowers are white to pale blue, with prominent yellow centers, and it produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Centaurea leucadea is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
