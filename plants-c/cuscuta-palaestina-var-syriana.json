    "intro": "Cuscuta palaestina var. syriana, commonly known as the Syrian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia, often found growing on crops like wheat and barley. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to spread widely. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
