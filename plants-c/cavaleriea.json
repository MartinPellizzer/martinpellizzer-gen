    "intro": "Cavaleriea, commonly known as the velvet tamarisk, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, scale-like leaves that give it a velvety texture, and it produces clusters of pink or purple flowers in the summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it can become invasive in certain areas if not managed properly."
