    "intro": "Comarum palustre var. subglandulosum, commonly known as the glandular marsh crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia. It features slender, branching stems that typically grow up to 30 cm in height, often emerging from a rhizomatous root system. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in a dense, rounded cluster at the top of the stems. Its leaves are basal, floating, and oval-shaped with a waxy coating, adapted for survival in waterlogged soils. This variety is distinguished by the presence of glandular dots on its leaves and stems, which give it its specific name."
