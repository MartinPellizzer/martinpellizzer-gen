    "intro": "Crepis ruderalis, commonly known as the ruderal hawk's-beak, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is a small, annual or biennial herb that typically grows in disturbed soils such as roadsides and waste areas. The plant has slender stems and produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by spiny, club-shaped achenes. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Crepis ruderalis is adapted to thrive in harsh environments and is often considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
