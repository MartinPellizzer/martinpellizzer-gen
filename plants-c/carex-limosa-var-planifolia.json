    "intro": "Carex limosa var. planifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically flat and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-brown flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is characterized by its reduced leaf complexity compared to other Carex species, making it distinct in appearance."
