    "intro": "Cerastium vulgatum f. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The leaves are narrow and hairy, arranged in a rosette at the base, and the stems are prostrate, often rooting at the nodes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its narrower foliage compared to the typical form of Cerastium vulgatum."
