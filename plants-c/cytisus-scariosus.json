It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are covered in a distinctive white, waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Cytisus scariosus is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers."
