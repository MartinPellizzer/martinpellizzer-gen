    "intro": "Corallorhiza integra, commonly known as the pink fairy\u83b2, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is a non-photosynthetic plant that relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant lacks chlorophyll and has a slender, tuberous root system that stores energy. Its flowers are typically pink or white, with a distinctive spurred shape. It thrives in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found growing in association with other orchids."
