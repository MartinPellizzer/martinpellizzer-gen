    "intro": "Carduus \u00d7 ilvensis, commonly known as the Italian thistle, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Carduus benedictus and Carduus marianus. It is characterized by its spiny, purple flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in temperate regions across Europe. Its leaves are broad, lobed, and covered in coarse hairs, which help reduce water loss. The Italian thistle is often used in traditional medicine and has ornamental value in gardens."
