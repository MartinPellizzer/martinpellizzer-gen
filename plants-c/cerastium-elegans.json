    "intro": "Cerastium elegans, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, hairy stems and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant's leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Cerastium elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet habitats."
