    "intro": "Curcuma latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved turmeric, is a rhizomatous herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that are often hidden beneath its foliage, and its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Curcuma latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects."
