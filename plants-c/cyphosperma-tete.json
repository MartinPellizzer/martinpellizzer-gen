    "intro": "Cyphosperma tete, commonly known as the Tete cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. Cyphosperma tete is adapted to arid and rocky environments, showcasing its resilience to harsh conditions. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
