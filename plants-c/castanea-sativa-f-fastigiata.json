    "intro": "Castanea sativa f. fastigiata, commonly known as the columnar horse chestnut, is a unique form of the common horse chestnut. It is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit, making it an ideal choice for space-constrained gardens. The plant produces large, showy white flowers in spring, followed by spiny capsules containing edible nuts. Its leaves are palmately lobed and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
