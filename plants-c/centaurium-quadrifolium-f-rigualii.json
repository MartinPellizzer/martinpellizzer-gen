    "intro": "Centaurium quadrifolium f. rigualii, commonly known as the four-leaf centaury, is a rare botanical variant of the centaury plant. It is characterized by its distinctive four-leaf structure, which is a morphological feature that sets it apart from the typical three-leaf form of the species. The plant is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula, where it thrives in rocky and limestone-rich soils. It produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
