    "intro": "Cryptochilus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a genus of epiphytic orchids native to Southeast Asia. These plants are characterized by their unique, often pale or translucent leaves and flowers that resemble ghostly shapes. They typically grow on trees or rocks, relying on their roots for moisture and nutrients. Cryptochilus species are noted for their delicate appearance and are often found in humid, shaded environments. Due to their rarity and specific habitat requirements, many species are threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
