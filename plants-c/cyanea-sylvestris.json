    "intro": "Cyanea sylvestris, commonly known as the forest orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as purple, pink, and white. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, providing structural support for the flowering stems. Cyanea sylvestris thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in cloud forests and undercanopies where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake."
