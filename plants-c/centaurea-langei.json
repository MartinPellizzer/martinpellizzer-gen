    "intro": "Centaurea langei, commonly known as Lange's cornflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its vibrant blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
