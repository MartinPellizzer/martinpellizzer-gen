It is a herbaceous annual plant with hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces vibrant purple or pink flowers that open in the morning and close by midday, adapting to conserve moisture. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters at the leaf axils, giving it its scientific name.
