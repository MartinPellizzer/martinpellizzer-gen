    "intro": "Crocion, commonly known as the sea holly, is a coastal plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines of the Mediterranean and other temperate regions. The plant features striking, spiny leaves and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique adaptations allow it to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Crocion plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
