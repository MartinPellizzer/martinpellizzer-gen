    "intro": "Conyza saxatilis, commonly known as the rock aster, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small, pale yellow to white flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Conyza saxatilis is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and gravelly slopes."
