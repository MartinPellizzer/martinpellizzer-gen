The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Cyclachaena lobata is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its native environment, making it an interesting subject for ecological studies."
