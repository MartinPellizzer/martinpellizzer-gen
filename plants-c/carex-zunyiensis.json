    "intro": "Carex zunyiensis, commonly known as the Zunyi sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to China, specifically the Yunnan province, where it grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and stream sides. The plant is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically reaches a height of about 30 to 50 centimeters and has a rhizomatous growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Carex zunyiensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
