    "intro": "Cypripedium parviflorum var. planipetalum, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, pouch-like lip that is typically pink or white with a yellowish throat. The plant has a single, upright stem that bears a single, showy flower with three sepals and three petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and marshes. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern."
