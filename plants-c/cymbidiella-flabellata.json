    "intro": "Cymbidiella flabellata, commonly known as the flabellate orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, falcate (sickle-shaped) leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are fibrous and often form a dense network that helps anchor it in its habitat. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
