    "intro": "Cyathea atrovirens var. ciliatopaleacea, commonly known as the ciliate-veined tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots. The fronds are large, pinnately compound, and have a dark green color with distinctive ciliate margins on the leaflets. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobili. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
