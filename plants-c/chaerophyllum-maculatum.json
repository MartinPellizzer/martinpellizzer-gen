    "intro": "Chaerophyllum maculatum, commonly known as spotted deadnettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves with distinctive purple or reddish markings. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters along the stem, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their mild sedative and anti-inflammatory properties."
