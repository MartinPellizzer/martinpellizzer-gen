It is characterized by its vibrant, variegated leaves that display shades of red, orange, and yellow, making it a popular ornamental plant. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy texture, contributing to its aesthetic appeal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. While it does not produce showy flowers, its foliage alone makes it a standout addition to gardens and indoor spaces."
