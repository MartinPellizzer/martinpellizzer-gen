    "intro": "Clidemia pterosepala, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silverleaf, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the tips of the branches. Clidemia pterosepala is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed areas make it an invasive species in some regions."
