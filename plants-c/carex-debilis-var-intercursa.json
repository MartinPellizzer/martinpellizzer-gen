    "intro": "Carex debilis var. intercursa, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
