    "intro": "Critoniopsis huilensis, commonly known as the Huil\u00e9nsis orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Critoniopsis huilensis is considered threatened, highlighting the need for protective measures to preserve its existence."
