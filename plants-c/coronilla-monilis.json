    "intro": "Coronilla monilis, commonly known as the clustered vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being oval-shaped and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that mature into a distinctive, clustered formation, giving the plant its common name. Coronilla monilis is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to temperate climates."
