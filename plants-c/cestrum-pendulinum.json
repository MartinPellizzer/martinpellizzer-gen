    "intro": "Cestrum pendulinum, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and potatoes, and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers. The plant is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, with woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers, which open at night, are typically white or pale pink and emit a strong, sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. The plant produces small, red berries that contain seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
