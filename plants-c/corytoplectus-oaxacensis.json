    "intro": "Corytoplectus oaxacensis, commonly known as the Oaxaca burrowing shrimp, is a small crustacean belonging to the family Callianassidae. It is native to the coastal waters of the Pacific Ocean, particularly in the southern regions of Mexico. This species is characterized by its elongated body and specialized appendages adapted for burrowing in sandy substrates. It plays a role in sediment mixing and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
