    "intro": "Corydalis aquae-gelidae, commonly known as the alpine corydalis, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to cold, mountainous environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
