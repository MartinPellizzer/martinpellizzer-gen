    "intro": "Castilleja tenuiflora var. tancitaroana, commonly known as the Tancitaro milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and reduced leaves. The plant forms dense colonies in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in association with grasses and shrubs. Its root system allows it to parasitize the roots of neighboring plants, drawing nutrients and water. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for pollinators in its native range."
