    "intro": "Cecropia purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-leaf ceiba, is a fast-growing, large tree native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple or red, especially when young. The plant has a distinctive trunk with a swollen base, which provides structural support for its extensive canopy. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody pods containing seeds with silky hair, aiding in wind dispersal. This species is often used in reforestation projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
