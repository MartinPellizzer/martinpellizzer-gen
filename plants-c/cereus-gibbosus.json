    "intro": "Cereus gibbosus, commonly known as the football cactus, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to several feet in height. The plant produces striking white flowers that bloom at night, a feature common among many cacti in the night-blooming family. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and resilience."
