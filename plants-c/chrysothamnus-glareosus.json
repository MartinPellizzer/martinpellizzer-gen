    "intro": "Chrysothamnus glareosus, commonly known as the yellow rabbitbrush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and silvery-green foliage, which are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry, sandy soils. Chrysothamnus glareosus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife in its native range."
