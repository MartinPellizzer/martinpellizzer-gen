    "intro": "Cereus engelmannii var. chrysocentrus, commonly known as the golden crown cactus, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered with white, woolly spines. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom at night, a trait typical of many cacti in the night-blooming group. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Its unique appearance and nocturnal flowering make it a striking addition to arid gardens."
