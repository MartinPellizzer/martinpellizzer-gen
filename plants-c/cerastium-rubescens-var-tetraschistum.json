    "intro": "Cerastium rubescens var. tetraschistum, commonly known as the pink mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its delicate appearance and early blooming habit make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
