    "intro": "Castilleja calcicola, commonly known as the desert paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Castilleja calcicola thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand prolonged periods of drought."
