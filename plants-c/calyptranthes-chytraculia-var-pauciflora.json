    "intro": "Calyptranthes chytraculia var. pauciflora, commonly known as the rare mountain calyptranthes, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its compact shrub form and leathery, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green in color. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in high-altitude environments with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
