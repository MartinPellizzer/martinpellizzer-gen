    "intro": "Cuscuta chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina, and is often found on shrubs and trees. Its life cycle involves germinating on host seeds and establishing a connection through specialized root-like structures called haustoria. Cuscuta chilensis is an example of a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can photosynthesize to a limited extent but still depends heavily on its host for survival."
