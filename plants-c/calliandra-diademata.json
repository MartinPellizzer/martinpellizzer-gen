    "intro": "Calliandra diademata, commonly known as the pink calliandra, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its feathery, pink to red bracts that are often mistaken for flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Calliandra diademata is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in agricultural settings."
