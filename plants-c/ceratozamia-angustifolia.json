    "intro": "Ceratozamia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a species of cycad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
