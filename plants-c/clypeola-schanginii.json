    "intro": "Clypeola schanginii, commonly known as the Schangin's clypeola, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in umbels. Native to specific regions in Central Asia, this plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical structure includes a taproot system and a short, stout stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a plant of conservation interest."
