    "intro": "Cardamine impatiens var. minor, commonly known as the lesser watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a peppery aroma, and small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. This variety is often confused with other Cardamine species due to its similar appearance and growth habits."
