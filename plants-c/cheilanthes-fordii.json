    "intro": "Cheilanthes fordii, commonly known as the Ford's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has a short, thick rhizome with dense, overlapping, leathery fronds that are usually dark green in color. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a thin, membranous indusium. This species is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used as an indicator of specific soil types and microhabitats."
