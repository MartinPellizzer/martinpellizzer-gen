It features dense, scale-like foliage that forms a mat-like appearance, making it ideal for ground cover. The plant has a slow growth rate and retains its evergreen foliage throughout the year. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, preferring dry to moderately moist conditions. Its unique form and ornamental value make it a popular choice in rock gardens and as a border plant."
