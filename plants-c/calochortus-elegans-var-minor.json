    "intro": "Calochortus elegans var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf glory-of-the-snow, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellow or green throat. The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 15 centimeters, making it a compact and ornamental addition to gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, thriving in cooler climates. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a member of the Liliaceae family and its adaptation to arid environments."
