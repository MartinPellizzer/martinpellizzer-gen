    "intro": "Cavendishia marginata, commonly known as the marginata orchid, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, meaning it grows in clusters rather than from a single stem. Its leaves are typically elliptical and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical environment. Cavendishia marginata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
