    "intro": "Cirsium bactiacense, commonly known as the Bactrian thistle, is a perennial plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a robust root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
