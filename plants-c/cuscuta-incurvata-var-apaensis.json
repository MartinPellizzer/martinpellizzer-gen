    "intro": "Cuscuta incurvata var. apaensis, commonly known as the Apache dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a tangled, vine-like structure composed of slender, thread-like stems. The plant is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it commonly parasitizes various grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to spread across different habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants."
