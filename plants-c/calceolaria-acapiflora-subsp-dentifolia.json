    "intro": "Calceolaria acapiflora subsp. dentifolia, commonly known as the toothed slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its distinctive calyx-like structure that resembles a slipper or a pouch. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and orange, which are typically borne on erect stems. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a slightly toothed margin, giving it its subspecies name. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats."
