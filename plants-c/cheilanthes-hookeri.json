    "intro": "Cheilanthes hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's rockcap, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America and the southern United States. It is a terrestrial fern that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often growing in crevices or on exposed rock faces. The plant has a short, thick rhizome with dense, leathery fronds that are typically evergreen. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Cheilanthes hookeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens due to its hardy nature."
