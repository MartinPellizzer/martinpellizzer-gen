It is characterized by its distinctive spiny bracts that encase the flower clusters, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces oval, chestnut-like fruits that are typically harvested in the autumn. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a glossy green surface. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking floral display and historical use in traditional medicine."
