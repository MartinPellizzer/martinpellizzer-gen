    "intro": "Cynosurus elegans var. obliquatus, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curved. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
