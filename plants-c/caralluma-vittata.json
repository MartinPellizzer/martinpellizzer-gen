    "intro": "Caralluma vittata, commonly known as the Tiger Tail Cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan. It is characterized by its segmented, cylindrical stems that are often green or reddish in color, with prominent longitudinal stripes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments due to its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. Caralluma vittata is also known for its traditional use in Ayurvedic medicine."
