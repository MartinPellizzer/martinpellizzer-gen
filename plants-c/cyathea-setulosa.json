    "intro": "Cyathea setulosa, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer. The plant has large, compound fronds that can reach several meters in length, with a distinctive feathery appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Cyathea setulosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
