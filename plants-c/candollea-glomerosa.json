    "intro": "Candollea glomerosa, commonly known as the clustered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and derives nutrients from its host plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions where it attaches to various host species. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host plants."
