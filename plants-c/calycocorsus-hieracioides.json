    "intro": "Calycocorsus hieracioides, commonly known as the goldenstar tickseed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in the spring, adding vibrant color to its native habitat. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration."
