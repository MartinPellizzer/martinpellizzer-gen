    "intro": "Calyptrotheca taitensis, commonly known as the Tait's calyptrotheca, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, commonly known as the carrot or parsley family, which is characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. The plant is distinguished by its distinctive calyptera, a specialized structure that encloses the base of the flower cluster. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories, and is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Calyptrotheca taitensis is considered a vulnerable species."
