    "intro": "Cyperus conglomeratus f. pachyrhizus, commonly known as the thick-rooted flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often in marshy areas or along waterways. Its roots are notably thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and nutrients. The inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in dense clusters, typical of many Cyperaceae species."
