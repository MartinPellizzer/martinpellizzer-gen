    "intro": "Ceratandra globosa, commonly known as the globe lily, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, round-shaped inflorescence, which resembles a globe, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that are clustered closely together. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. Ceratandra globosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique and striking floral display."
