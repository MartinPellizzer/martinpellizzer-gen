    "intro": "Caulotretus cordifolius, commonly known as the heart-leaved fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces numerous fronds, which are typically bioluminescent at night. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
