    "intro": "Carex frigida var. fuliginosa, commonly known as the black sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, foliage that gives it its common name. This variant of Carex frigida thrives in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and wetlands. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikes and are often pollinated by wind."
