    "intro": "Cyathea polypoda, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, brownish layer of old fronds. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. Cyathea polypoda thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. It plays an important ecological role in tropical rainforests by providing habitat and contributing to forest structure."
