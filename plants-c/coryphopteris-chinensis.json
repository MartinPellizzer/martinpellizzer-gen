    "intro": "Coryphopteris chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese holly fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
