    "intro": "Cordia decandra, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, Cordia decandra is both ecologically and culturally significant."
