    "intro": "Clintonia borealis f. lateralis, commonly known as the late-flowering white bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Melanthiaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom later in the season than the typical form of Clintonia borealis. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and is often found in rich, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
