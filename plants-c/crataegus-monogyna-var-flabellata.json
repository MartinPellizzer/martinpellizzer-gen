    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna var. flabellata, commonly known as the white thornapple, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the autumn, which are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. This variety is distinguished by its flabellate (fan-shaped) petals, which give it its specific epithet."
