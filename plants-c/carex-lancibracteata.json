    "intro": "Carex lancibracteata, commonly known as the narrow bract sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown, with the bracts being narrow and often longer than the flowers. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Carex lancibracteata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
