    "intro": "Carex glauca var. murensis, commonly known as blue-green sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that ranges from blue-green to silver-gray in color. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike that bears small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
