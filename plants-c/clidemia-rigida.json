    "intro": "Clidemia rigida, commonly known as roughleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and typically grows on the branches of trees such as mahogany and ceiba. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are followed by small, round berries. Clidemia rigida plays a role in its ecosystem by providing food for certain birds and insects, although it can also negatively impact its host trees by drawing nutrients and water."
