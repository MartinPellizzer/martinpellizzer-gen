It features a complex network of vascular tissues that support its leaf structure and facilitate nutrient transport. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually pinnately divided, with finely serrated margins and a light green color. Cieca nervosa plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various small organisms."
