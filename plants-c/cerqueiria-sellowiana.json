    "intro": "Cerqueiria sellowiana, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, upright stems and clustered leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often borne in spikes, typically blooming during the spring and summer months. Cerqueiria sellowiana thrives in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to the humid climate of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
