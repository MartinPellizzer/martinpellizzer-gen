    "intro": "Cassia barclayana, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves and long, drooping clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant produces elongated, flat pods that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cassia barclayana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common species in disturbed soils and urban landscapes."
