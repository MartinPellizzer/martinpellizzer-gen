    "intro": "Cyclobalanus, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, often found in coastal areas and tropical regions. Cyclobalanus species are adapted to saline environments, making them resilient to salt spray and tidal influences. Their flowers attract pollinators such as bees and birds, contributing to their ecological significance in coastal ecosystems."
