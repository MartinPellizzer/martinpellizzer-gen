    "intro": "Cecropia arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider-plant ceiba, is a fast-growing tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves and a unique, hollow stem that resembles a bamboo-like structure. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, spiny capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed or secondary forests. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
