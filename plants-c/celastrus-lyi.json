    "intro": "Celastrus lyi, commonly known as the Yucatan staff-vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Celastraceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, followed by orange-red berries containing several seeds. Celastrus lyi is often found in lowland forests and is adapted to thrive in humid, warm climates with partial to full sunlight. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
