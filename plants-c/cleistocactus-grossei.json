    "intro": "Cleistocactus grossei, commonly known as the giant night blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant is often cultivated for its striking appearance and unique blooming behavior."
