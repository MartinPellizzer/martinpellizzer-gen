    "intro": "Celtis, commonly known as the box-elder or honeylocust, is a genus of flowering plants in the elm family, Ulmaceae. These deciduous trees or shrubs are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They are characterized by their opposite, simple leaves that often have serrated edges. The small, greenish-yellow flowers are followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Celtis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
