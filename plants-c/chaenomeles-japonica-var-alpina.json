    "intro": "Chaenomeles japonica var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine Japanese quince, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its thick, rugged bark and small, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that ripen in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
