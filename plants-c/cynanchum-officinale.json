    "intro": "Cynanchum officinale, commonly known as swallow wort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, opposite leaves and showy, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky latex sap, which contains various alkaloids and is often used in traditional medicine. It typically grows in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
