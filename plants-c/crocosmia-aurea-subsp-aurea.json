It features striking orange-red flowers that bloom in summer, arranged in dense, sword-shaped inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and slightly folded along the midrib. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
