    "intro": "Cupressus lawsoniana f. viridis, commonly known as the Lawson's cypress var. viridis, is a compact, pyramidal evergreen conifer with dense, scale-like foliage. It is a naturally occurring form of the Lawson's cypress, characterized by its bright green, needle-like leaves that contrast with the typical bluish-green color of the species. The plant is native to the western United States and thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is often used in horticulture as a ornamental shrub or small tree due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature. The foliage remains vibrant throughout the year, making it a popular choice for landscaping in cooler climates."
