    "intro": "Cyperus diffusus var. diffusus, commonly known as spikerush, is a flowering plant in the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is a perennial herb characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and dense clusters of small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense stands that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Cyperus diffusus var. diffusus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
