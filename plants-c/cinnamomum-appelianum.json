    "intro": "Cinnamomum appelianum, commonly known as the Malabar cinnamon or Ceylon cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of southern India and Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its aromatic, cinnamon-scented bark, which is harvested and dried to produce the spice cinnamon. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Its essential oils, rich in cinnamaldehyde, contribute to its distinctive flavor and medicinal properties. The tree thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and commercial use."
