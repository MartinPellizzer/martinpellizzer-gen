    "intro": "Cytinus baronii, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant is characterized by its distinctive crown-like structure at the base, which gives it its common name. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Cytinus baronii is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky soils."
