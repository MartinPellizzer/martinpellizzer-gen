    "intro": "Centaurea straminea, commonly known as the yellow star-thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and spiny leaves, which are adapted to thrive in dry, disturbed soils. The plant produces a distinctive seed head that resembles a star, with bracts that are often covered in soft, white hairs. It is an invasive species in many regions outside its native range, posing a threat to native plant communities. Centaurea straminea is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and other open areas where it can spread rapidly."
