    "intro": "Castanea crenata var. tamba, commonly known as the Tamba chestnut, is a variety of the Japanese chestnut native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its serrated leaves and spiny fruit capsules. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a prickly husk, which ripen in the autumn. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and requires a cold winter dormancy period for optimal growth. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional Japanese agriculture."
