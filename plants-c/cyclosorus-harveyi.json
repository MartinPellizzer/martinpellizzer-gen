    "intro": "Cyclosorus harveyi, commonly known as the Harvey's cyclosorus, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, characterized by a flat, ribbon-like body with a distinct upper and lower surface. Its reproductive structures, including sporophytes, are borne on the thallus, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Cyclosorus harveyi is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat."
