    "intro": "Cirsium rouyana, commonly known as the Rouy's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cirsium rouyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
