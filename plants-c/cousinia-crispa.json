    "intro": "Cousinia crispa, commonly known as the cushion cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, silver-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Cousinia crispa is well adapted to cold, rocky habitats and is often found at high elevations. Its unique morphology and resilience make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
