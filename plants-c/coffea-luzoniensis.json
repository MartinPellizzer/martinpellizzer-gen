    "intro": "Coffea luzoniensis, commonly known as Luzon coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Philippines, specifically the island of Luzon, where it grows in humid, mountainous regions. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries containing the seeds used for coffee. It is a shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
