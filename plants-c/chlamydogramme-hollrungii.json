    "intro": "Chlamydogramme hollrungii, commonly known as the Himalayan dwarf fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit. The plant has finely divided, often curling fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
