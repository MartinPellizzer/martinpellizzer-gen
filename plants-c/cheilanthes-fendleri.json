    "intro": "Cheilanthes fendleri, commonly known as the desert hawksbeard, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial plant that thrives in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant features a rosette of leathery, blue-green leaves that help reduce water loss. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Cheilanthes fendleri plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often found in limestone or granite outcrops."
