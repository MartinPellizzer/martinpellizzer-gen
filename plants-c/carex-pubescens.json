    "intro": "Carex pubescens, commonly known as the hairy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, typical of sedges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Carex pubescens plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
