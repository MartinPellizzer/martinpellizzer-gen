    "intro": "Cratoxylum arboreum, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a large evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and broad, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in some regions."
