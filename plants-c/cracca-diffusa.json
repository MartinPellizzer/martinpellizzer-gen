    "intro": "Cracca diffusa, commonly known as the common cracca, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Cracca diffusa is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
