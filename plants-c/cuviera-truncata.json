    "intro": "Cuviera truncata, commonly known as the truncated cuviera, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which is typical of the daisy family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Cuviera truncata is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with its succulent leaves storing water and reducing transpiration."
