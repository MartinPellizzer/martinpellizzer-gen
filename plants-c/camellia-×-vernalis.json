    "intro": "Camellia \u00d7 vernalis, commonly known as the spring camellia, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Camellia japonica and Camellia sasanqua. It is native to Japan and is prized for its early blooming habit, typically flowering in late winter to early spring. The plant produces showy, single or semi-double flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often with a striking contrast between the petals and the deep-colored buds. Camellia \u00d7 vernalis is evergreen, with leathery, dark green leaves that provide ornamental value throughout the year. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in temperate climates."
