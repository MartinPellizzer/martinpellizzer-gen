    "intro": "Cyperus pohlii var. warmingii, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide, with a distinctive blue-green coloration. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in moist to aquatic conditions, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for wetland gardens and water features."
