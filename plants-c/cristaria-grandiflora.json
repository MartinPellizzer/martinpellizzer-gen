    "intro": "Cristaria grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered crista, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and produces striking, showy inflorescences composed of numerous small white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshy or swampy environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cristaria grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
