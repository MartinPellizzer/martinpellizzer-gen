    "intro": "Coulterophytum macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant papyrus, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length, making it a prominent feature in its natural habitat. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense stands that provide habitat for various aquatic species. Its rhizomes spread horizontally beneath the water, anchoring the plant and facilitating vegetative reproduction. The plant's unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
