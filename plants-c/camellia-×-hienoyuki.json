It is native to Japan and is prized for its ornamental value, particularly its showy, double blooms that range in color from white to deep red. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and elliptical in shape, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant flowers. Camellia \u00d7 hienoyuki is well-suited for cultivation in USDA hardiness zones 7 through 9, thriving in partial shade and well-drained soil."
