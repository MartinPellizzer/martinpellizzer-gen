    "intro": "Cinnamomum tonduzii, commonly known as the Madagascar cinnamon or tonduzii cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark brown bark that resembles cinnamon, though it is not related to the true cinnamon species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by egg-shaped, red berries that contain a single seed. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and have a strong, spicy scent. This species is valued for its unique fragrance and is often used in traditional medicine and as a spice in local cuisines."
