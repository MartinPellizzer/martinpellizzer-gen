    "intro": "Carex ablata var. luzuliformis, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This variety is distinguished by its slender, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. It often grows in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist habitats, contributing to ecological stability through erosion control. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, adding subtle ornamental value to its natural environment."
