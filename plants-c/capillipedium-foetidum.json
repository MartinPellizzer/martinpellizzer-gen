    "intro": "Capillipedium foetidum, commonly known as the stinking marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and swamps. Its most notable feature is its strong, unpleasant odor, which is thought to attract specific pollinators. Capillipedium foetidum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and soil stabilization."
