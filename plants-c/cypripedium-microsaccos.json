    "intro": "Cypripedium microsaccos, commonly known as the small-sacled lady's slipper, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like lip that is typically pale yellow or greenish in color. The plant grows in shaded, moist forest environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are relatively small compared to other lady's slipper species, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
