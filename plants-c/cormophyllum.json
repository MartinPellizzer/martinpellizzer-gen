    "intro": "Cormophyllum, commonly known as the false arrowhead, is a member of the Araceae family. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its corm-like underground stem, which serves as a storage organ. The plant produces striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are often variegated with green and white patterns. Its flowers are enclosed in a spathe, a modified leaf that protects the small, inconspicuous true flowers. Cormophyllum is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
