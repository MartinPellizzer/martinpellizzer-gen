    "intro": "Cerastium pauciflorum var. oxalidiflorum, commonly known as the oxalidiflorous mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves and clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many edible and economically important species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its delicate appearance and early blooming habit make it a notable wildflower in its native habitat."
