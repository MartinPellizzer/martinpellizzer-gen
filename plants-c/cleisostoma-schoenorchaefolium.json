    "intro": "Cleisostoma schoenorchaefolium, commonly known as the silver-veined cleisostoma, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety dark green leaves with prominent silver veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of rare orchids."
