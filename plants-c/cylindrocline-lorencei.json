It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like crown and its long, slender, spirally twisted branches. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a living relic of ancient flora. Its leaves are scale-like and densely packed, contributing to its overall appearance. The Socotra cypress is also notable for its potential medicinal properties and its ecological importance in its native habitat."
