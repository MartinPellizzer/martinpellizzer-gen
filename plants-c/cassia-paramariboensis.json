    "intro": "Cassia paramariboensis, commonly known as the Paramaribo cassia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is notable for its bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a striking visual element to its habitat. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, and the plant produces long, slender pods that contain seeds. Cassia paramariboensis is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
