    "intro": "Cleistocactus angosturensis, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, columnar cactus characterized by its ribbed stem and spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that open only at night, a trait known as nocturnal blooming. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in desert gardens and botanical collections."
