    "intro": "Cheilanthes cartilaginea, commonly known as the cartilaginous shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of fiddlehead-like fronds that remain tightly curled throughout the year. The plant's fronds are covered in a dense layer of fine, white, cartilaginous hairs, which give it its common name and help reduce water loss in arid environments. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in crevices or on cliffs. This resilient fern is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
