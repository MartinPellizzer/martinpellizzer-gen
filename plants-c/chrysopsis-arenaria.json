It is a low-growing perennial with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. It is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
