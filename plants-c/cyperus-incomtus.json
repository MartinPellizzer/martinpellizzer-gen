    "intro": "Cyperus incomtus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Cyperus incomtus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
