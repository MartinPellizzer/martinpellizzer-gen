    "intro": "Corema arenaria, commonly known as beach corema, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and harsh coastal conditions. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Its flowers are white and clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, which attract various pollinators. Corema arenaria plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
