    "intro": "Cassia arenaria, commonly known as sand cassia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, often appearing in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, and the plant is known for its ability to tolerate drought conditions. Cassia arenaria is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
