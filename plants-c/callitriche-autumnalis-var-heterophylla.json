    "intro": "Callitriche autumnalis var. heterophylla, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water, along the edges of ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often floating or submerged, with small, delicate leaves that are usually oval or lance-shaped. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale blue, and appear in clusters, often floating on the water surface. This variety is distinguished by its variable leaf morphology, which can change depending on environmental conditions."
