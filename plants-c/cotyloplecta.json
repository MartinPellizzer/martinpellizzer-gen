    "intro": "Cotyloplecta, commonly known as the \"spider orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. Cotyloplecta species are characterized by their unique, spider-like appearance, with long, slender stems and showy, often fragrant flowers. They typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks in their natural habitat. The flowers of Cotyloplecta are usually brightly colored, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species."
