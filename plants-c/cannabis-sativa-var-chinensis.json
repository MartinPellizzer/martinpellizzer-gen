    "intro": "Cannabis sativa var. chinensis, commonly known as Chinese cannabis, is a variant of the cannabis plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall stature, narrow leaves, and relatively low THC content compared to other cannabis varieties. This plant is primarily cultivated for its fibers, which are used in making textiles and paper. It also contains cannabidiol (CBD), which has been studied for its potential therapeutic properties. The botanical features of this variety make it distinct from other cannabis types, particularly in its morphology and chemical composition."
