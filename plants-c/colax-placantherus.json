    "intro": "Colax placantherus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Colax placantherus is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
