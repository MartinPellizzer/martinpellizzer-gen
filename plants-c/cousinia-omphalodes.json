    "intro": "Cousinia omphalodes, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, exhibiting a compact growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry environments. Cousinia omphalodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, drought-prone conditions."
