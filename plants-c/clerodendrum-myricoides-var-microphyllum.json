    "intro": "Clerodendrum myricoides var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved glorybower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and clusters of small, fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and have a glossy surface with a slightly serrated margin. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its showy inflorescences and adaptability to various soil conditions. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
