It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet, typically blooming in spring. The plant has gray-green, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. It is often found growing on rocky slopes and in sandy soils, demonstrating a high degree of drought tolerance.
