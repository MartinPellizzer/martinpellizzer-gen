    "intro": "Cyperus pangorei, commonly known as the water flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its cylindrical, grass-like stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically found in clusters at the ends of the stems. Cyperus pangorei thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its adaptability to wet conditions makes it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
