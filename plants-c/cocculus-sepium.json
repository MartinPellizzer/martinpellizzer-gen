    "intro": "Cocculus sepium, commonly known as devil's-bit cocklebur, is a perennial vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruit capsules that resemble small, inflated burs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges or along streambanks. The plant has been used historically in traditional medicine, though its toxicity requires caution in use."
