    "intro": "Cineraria nuda, commonly known as the naked cineraria, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Cineraria nuda is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
