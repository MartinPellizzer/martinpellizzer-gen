    "intro": "Ceratocephala orthoceras, commonly known as the straight-horned sea hare, is a species of sea slug belonging to the family Aeolidae. It is characterized by its elongated, soft body and a distinctive horn-like projection on its head. The plant, though not a true plant, is a marine gastropod mollusk with a complex anatomy that includes a radula for feeding. It thrives in shallow tropical and subtropical waters, often found on coral reefs and rocky substrates. Its vibrant coloration and unique morphology make it an important subject in marine biodiversity studies."
