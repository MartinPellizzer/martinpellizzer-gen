    "intro": "Caryophyllus corticosus, commonly known as the rough-hair sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes many species with showy flowers and succulent leaves. The plant is characterized by its hairy, rugged stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in fine, rough hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Caryophyllus corticosus is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation."
