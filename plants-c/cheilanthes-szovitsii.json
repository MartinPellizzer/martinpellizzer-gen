    "intro": "Cheilanthes szovitsii, commonly known as the Szovits' rockcap, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia, including China, India, and Southeast Asia. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, thriving in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a short, thick rhizome with tightly packed, leathery fronds that are often dark green in color. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Due to its hardy nature and ability to colonize rocky areas, it is often used in horticulture for landscaping in dry climates."
