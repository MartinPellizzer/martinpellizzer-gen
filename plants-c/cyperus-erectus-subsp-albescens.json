    "intro": "Cyperus erectus subsp. albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its adaptability, it is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain areas."
