    "intro": "Cyrtandra livida, commonly known as the Hawaiian bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and streamside areas. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Cyrtandra livida is an important component of Hawaii's native flora and is often found in conservation efforts due to its limited distribution."
