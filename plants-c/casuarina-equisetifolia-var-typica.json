    "intro": "Casuarina equisetifolia var. typica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved she-oak, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and cylindrical, woody cones that resemble those of a pine. The plant has a deep root system that helps stabilize coastal soils, making it valuable for erosion control. It thrives in saline and coastal environments, often found along beaches and dunes. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by edible seeds that are dispersed by wind."
