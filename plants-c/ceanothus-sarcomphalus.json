It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Ceanothus sarcomphalus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in its native habitat."
