    "intro": "Coffea lamtoensis, commonly known as the Lamto coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of western Africa, specifically Cameroon and Nigeria. This plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves and produces small, fragrant white flowers. The fruit, which is a berry, contains two seeds used for coffee production. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coffea lamtoensis is considered a rare and less commercially cultivated species."
