    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 halophila f. humilis, commonly known as the coastal sedge, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to coastal areas of the northern hemisphere. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in estuaries, salt marshes, and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. It is adapted to withstand periodic flooding and salt spray, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in marshy habitats."
