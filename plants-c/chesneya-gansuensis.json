    "intro": "Chesneya gansuensis, commonly known as the Gansu chesneya, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Gansu Province in China. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
