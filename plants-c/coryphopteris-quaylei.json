It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves and a compact, low-growing habit. Native to the tropical regions of Central America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. It is often found in forest understories where it plays a role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization."
