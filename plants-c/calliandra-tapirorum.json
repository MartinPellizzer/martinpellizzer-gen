    "intro": "Calliandra tapirorum, commonly known as the Tapir Tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves and showy, pink or red inflorescences. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry to semi-arid regions. Calliandra tapirorum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in reforestation efforts due to its hardiness and ecological benefits."
