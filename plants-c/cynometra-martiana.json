    "intro": "Cynometra martiana, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elongated, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood used in construction and furniture, though it is also threatened by habitat loss. The species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
