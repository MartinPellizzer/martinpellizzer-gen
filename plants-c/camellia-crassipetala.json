    "intro": "Camellia crassipetala, commonly known as the broad-leaved camellia, is a species native to China and is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves. It produces showy, camellia-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant is an evergreen shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Camellia crassipetala is also valued for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its tea leaves, though it is not as widely used as other camellia species."
