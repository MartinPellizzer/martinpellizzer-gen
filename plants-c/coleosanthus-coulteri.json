    "intro": "Coleosanthus coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils or along stream banks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces three-angled, fibrous seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, drought-prone conditions."
