    "intro": "Caesalpinia arenosa, commonly known as the sand verbena or desert bean, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, with compound leaves and showy yellow-orange flowers. The plant is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots and a thick cuticle to reduce water loss. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, and it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils. Caesalpinia arenosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
