    "intro": "Crocus sativus subsp. cartwrightianus, commonly known as the Cartwright's crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces striking violet-blue flowers with prominent yellow stigmas, typical of the Crocus genus. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its bulbs are smaller than those of the saffron crocus, and it is less commonly cultivated for commercial purposes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
