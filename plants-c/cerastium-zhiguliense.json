    "intro": "Cerastium zhiguliense, commonly known as the Zhiguli mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant features small, hairy leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within the genus Cerastium."
