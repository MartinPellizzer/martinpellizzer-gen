    "intro": "Crataegus pyracanthifolia, commonly known as the thorned hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits. The species is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
