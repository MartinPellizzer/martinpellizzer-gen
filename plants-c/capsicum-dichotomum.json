    "intro": "Capsicum dichotomum, commonly known as the two-branched pepper, is a species native to South America. It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by bright red, round fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate with a slightly hairy surface. The botanical features of Capsicum dichotomum make it distinct within the Capsicum genus, particularly due to its branching pattern and fruit morphology."
