    "intro": "Carex vulpina var. nemorosa, commonly known as the wood sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, strap-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and is often found in association with other wetland plants. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a valuable component of wetland ecosystems."
