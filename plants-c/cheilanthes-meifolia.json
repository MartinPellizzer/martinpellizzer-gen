    "intro": "Cheilanthes meifolia, commonly known as the meadow cliffbrake, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils, often in open woodland or mountainous areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Cheilanthes meifolia is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that thrives in full sun to partial shade."
