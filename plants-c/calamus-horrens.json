    "intro": "Calamus horrens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved calamus, is a member of the Arecaceae family, which includes palms. It is a tall, slender plant with long, narrow leaves that are typically arching and can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Calamus horrens is native to tropical regions of Asia and is adapted to humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary appeal lies in its elegant foliage."
