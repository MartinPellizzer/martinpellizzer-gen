    "intro": "Cereus napoleonis, commonly known as the Napoleon's cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a tall, unbranched stem that can reach heights of up to 10 feet. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a characteristic feature of many cacti in the Cactaceae family. Its stems are covered in fine, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
