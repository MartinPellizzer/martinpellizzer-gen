    "intro": "Cardiopteris rumphii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often on cliffs or in mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to steep surfaces. The leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
