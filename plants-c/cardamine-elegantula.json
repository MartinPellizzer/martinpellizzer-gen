    "intro": "Cardamine elegantula, commonly known as slender water crowfoot, is a small perennial herb native to moist, temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, stream banks, and other waterlogged soils, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a waxy surface, and its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, arranged in a loose cluster. It produces elliptical, greenish-brown seeds that are dispersed by water or wind. Due to its preference for wet habitats, it is often found in riparian zones and is an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
