    "intro": "Conchocarpus racemosus, commonly known as the red mangrove or mangrove apple, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae. It is a tropical tree that thrives in coastal areas, particularly in mangrove ecosystems. The plant is characterized by its red, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed, and its roots often form a tangled network to anchor it in waterlogged soil. It plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species. The plant's ability to tolerate saline conditions makes it an important component of coastal vegetation."
