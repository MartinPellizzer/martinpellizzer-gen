    "intro": "Cieca solanacea, commonly known as the nightshade vine, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, peppers, and potatoes. It is a climbing plant with heart-shaped leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that open at night. The plant bears berries that change color from green to red as they mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its relation to toxic nightshades, it requires careful handling and cultivation."
