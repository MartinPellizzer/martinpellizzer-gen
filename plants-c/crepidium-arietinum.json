    "intro": "Crepidium arietinum, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps retain moisture in harsh conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
