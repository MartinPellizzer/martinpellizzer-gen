It is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States, characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by blue-black berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Courbonia glauca is also valued for its ability to tolerate coastal conditions and salt spray."
