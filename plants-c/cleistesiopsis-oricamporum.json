    "intro": "Cleistesiopsis oricamporum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, arid environments such as desert grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, well-drained soils. Cleistesiopsis oricamporum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
