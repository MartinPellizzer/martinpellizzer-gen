    "intro": "Cycas montana, commonly known as the mountain cycad, is a species of cycad native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a gymnosperm, characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are typically dark green and can grow up to several meters in length. Cycas montana is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
