    "intro": "Calamagrostis altissima, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, grass-like plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, often forming dense stands in wet or moist environments. The plant produces feathery, panicle-shaped inflorescences that are typically pink to purplish in color, appearing in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are long, narrow, and slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal in gardens. Calamagrostis altissima is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
