    "intro": "Cuscuta breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of slender, thread-like stems. The plant's seeds are tiny and can remain viable in the soil for many years, facilitating its spread. It is often found in agricultural fields and disturbed areas where it attaches to a variety of host plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants."
