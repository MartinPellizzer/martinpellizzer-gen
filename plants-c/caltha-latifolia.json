    "intro": "Caltha latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf marsh marigold, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine, waxy coating. Caltha latifolia is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, wet conditions."
