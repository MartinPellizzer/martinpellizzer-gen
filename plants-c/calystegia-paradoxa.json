It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dry seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in dry grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it is considered a potential weed in some regions."
