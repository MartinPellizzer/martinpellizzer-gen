    "intro": "Collomia debilis var. camporum, commonly known as Camp's weakstalk, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. This species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
