    "intro": "Caladenia dorrigoensis, commonly known as the Dorrigo spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Dorrigo region of New South Wales, Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, intricate flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing pale yellow to greenish flowers with prominent, hood-like petals. Caladenia dorrigoensis is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
