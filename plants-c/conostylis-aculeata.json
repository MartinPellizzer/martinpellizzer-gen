    "intro": "Conostylis aculeata, commonly known as the prickly conostylis, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a member of the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland regions. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine, prickly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers are usually white or pale blue and bloom during the spring and summer months."
