    "intro": "Cleistes latiglossa, commonly known as the narrow-lipped cleistocarp, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, urn-shaped flowers that are typically closed at the time of pollination. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers open only briefly, making it difficult to observe in the wild. Cleistes latiglossa is often found in moist, wooded areas and is considered a rare species due to habitat loss and limited distribution. Its botanical features make it an important subject for conservation and ecological studies."
