    "intro": "Cousinia lachnosphaera var. kashanensis, commonly known as the Kashan cottonthistle, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, pink to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Its fibrous roots help it survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
