    "intro": "Celastrus longipes, commonly known as the longipes bittersweet, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, elliptic leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its woody stems can become quite long, often reaching several meters in length as it climbs trees or structures. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal but requires caution due to its toxic properties."
