    "intro": "Cadiscus aquaticus, commonly known as the water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has floating leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its roots are anchored in the sediment, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. Cadiscus aquaticus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
