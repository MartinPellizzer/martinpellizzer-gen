    "intro": "Castanea divaricata, commonly known as the Chinese horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Fagaceae, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its lobed leaves and spiny capsules. The tree produces edible nuts enclosed in a prickly husk, similar to other members of the chestnut genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with suitable growing conditions."
