    "intro": "Cyperus agrestis, commonly known as swamp arrowgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in wetland environments, including marshes and along the edges of ponds and streams. Cyperus agrestis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
