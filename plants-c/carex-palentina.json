    "intro": "Carex palentina, commonly known as slender sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in wetland areas. Carex palentina is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
