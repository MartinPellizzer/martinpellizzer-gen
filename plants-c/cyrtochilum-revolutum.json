    "intro": "Cyrtochilum revolutum, commonly known as the curled lip orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, often hairy pseudobulbs and linear, lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are usually pale yellow to orange, with a distinctive, curled lip that gives it its common name. Cyrtochilum revolutum thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. It is a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
