    "intro": "Cyrtodeira, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Indian nettle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a velvety texture. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, with five petals that are usually white or pale pink. Cyrtodeira species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. They are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands."
