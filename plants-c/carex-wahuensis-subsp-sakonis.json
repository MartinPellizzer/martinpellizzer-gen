    "intro": "Carex wahuensis subsp. sakonis, commonly known as the Sakon Carex, is a perennial sedge native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of greenish or brownish flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
