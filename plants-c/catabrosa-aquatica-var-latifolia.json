    "intro": "Catabrosa aquatica var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf water catabrosa, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, floating leaves that can reach up to 10 centimeters in length, providing shade and habitat for aquatic life. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. It has small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually borne on short stalks above the water surface. Its rapid growth makes it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
