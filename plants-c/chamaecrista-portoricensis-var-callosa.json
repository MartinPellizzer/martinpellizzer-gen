    "intro": "Chamaecrista portoricensis var. callosa, commonly known as the Puerto Rican burr legume, is a shrub native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and dry forests, adapting to sandy and well-drained soils. It produces yellow flowers during the dry season, which attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
