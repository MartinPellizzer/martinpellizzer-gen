It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and the flowers are typically arranged in dense inflorescences.
