    "intro": "Colpodium chionogeiton, commonly known as the snow-dwelling bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are slender and often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Colpodium chionogeiton is adapted to cold environments, which is reflected in its common name and its seasonal blooming pattern."
