    "intro": "Cucumis sativus var. ennemis, commonly known as the enemy cucumber, is a variant of the common cucumber with distinct botanical features. It typically exhibits a more elongated and spiky fruit compared to standard cucumbers, with a thicker, often hairy rind. The plant has robust, trailing vines that produce small, yellow flowers, typical of the Cucurbitaceae family. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a slightly serrated edge. This variety is less commonly cultivated due to its aggressive growth habit and reduced commercial appeal."
