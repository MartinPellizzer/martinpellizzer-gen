    "intro": "Cicuta angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved water hemlock, is a toxic member of the parsley family (Apiaceae). It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant contains potent toxins, primarily cicutoxin, which can cause severe poisoning in humans and animals. It typically grows in wet, disturbed soils along streams and roadsides. Due to its high toxicity, it is considered a dangerous weed and should be avoided."
