    "intro": "Chlorophytum angulicaule, commonly known as the angled snake plant, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features upright, sword-shaped leaves that are often variegated with yellow or white markings. The plant produces small, white flowers on slender stalks during the growing season. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its rosette growth habit and air-purifying qualities make it a popular houseplant."
