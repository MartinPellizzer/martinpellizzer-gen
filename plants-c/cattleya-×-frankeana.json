    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 frankeana, commonly known as the Frankeana Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid that exhibits a blend of characteristics from its parent species. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces large, showy flowers with vibrant colors, often in shades of pink, red, and orange, which attract pollinators. Its pseudobulbs are robust and support the plant's growth, while its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding substrate. This orchid is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
