    "intro": "Cotoneaster salicifolius var. rugosus, commonly known as the rough-leaved cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features elongated, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a distinctive rough or warty texture, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during late spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it can be invasive in some regions, making it a plant of both aesthetic and ecological interest."
