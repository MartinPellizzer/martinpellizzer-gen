    "intro": "Celosia dioica, commonly known as the flame flower or cookea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, feather-like bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. Celosia dioica thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds adds to its ecological value."
