    "intro": "Cenchrus retusus, commonly known as the roughhair grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with a rough texture, and its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets. It is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system and drought tolerance. Cenchrus retusus is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
