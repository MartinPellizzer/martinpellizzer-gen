    "intro": "Coccinia pwaniensis, commonly known as the Pwani leaf vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to East Africa. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and gourds, and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are typically harvested when they are still green, though they can ripen to a red color. Its rapid growth habit and ability to climb make it a common sight in humid, shaded environments."
