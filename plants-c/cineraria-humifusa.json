    "intro": "Cineraria humifusa, commonly known as the cushion cineraria, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Canary Islands. It features dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
