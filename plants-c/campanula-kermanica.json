It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Campanula kermanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
