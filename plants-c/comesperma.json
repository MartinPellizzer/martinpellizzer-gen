    "intro": "Comesperma, commonly known as the white-flowered honeysuckle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caprifoliaceae. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plants are shrubs or small trees, often with opposite, ovate leaves that have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Comesperma species are native to various regions in Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands, and they thrive in temperate to subtropical climates. Their fruit, which is usually a small, fleshy drupe, is an important food source for birds and other wildlife."
