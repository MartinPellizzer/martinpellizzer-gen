    "intro": "Coelogyne speciosa var. albicans, commonly known as the White Orchid of the Himalayas, is a striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its cool, humid environment. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, adapted to reduce water loss. This variety is highly valued in horticulture for its elegant appearance and fragrance."
