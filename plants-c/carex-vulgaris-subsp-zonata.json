    "intro": "Carex vulgaris subsp. zonata, commonly known as the zonate sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and distinctive flowering spikes that are usually green or reddish in color. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms. The zonate sedge is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to fluctuating water levels."
