    "intro": "Calamintha acinoides, commonly known as creeping calamint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features aromatic, hairy leaves with a distinctive mint-like scent, which is due to the presence of essential oils. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Calamintha acinoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
