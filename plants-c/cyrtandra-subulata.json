    "intro": "Cyrtandra subulata, commonly known as the needleleaf cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is often found growing on rocky or humus-rich soils. Cyrtandra subulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
