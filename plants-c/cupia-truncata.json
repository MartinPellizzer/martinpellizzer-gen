It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.
