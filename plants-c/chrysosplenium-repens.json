    "intro": "Chrysosplenium repens, commonly known as creeping chrysosplenium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters along the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats, making it an effective ground cover in suitable habitats."
