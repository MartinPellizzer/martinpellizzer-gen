    "intro": "Celastrus, commonly known as bindweed, is a genus of flowering plants that includes both woody and herbaceous species. These plants are typically found in temperate regions and are characterized by their opposite, simple leaves and usually showy flowers. Many species of Celastrus produce berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. The genus includes several species, such as Celastrus paniculatus and Celastrus orbiculatus, which are sometimes invasive in non-native regions. Botanically, Celastrus is notable for its diverse morphology and ecological adaptability."
