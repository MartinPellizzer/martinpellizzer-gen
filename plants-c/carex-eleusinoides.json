    "intro": "Carex eleusinoides, commonly known as blue sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flower spikes that are typically green or brown, and it thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes and wetlands. Blue sedge is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
