    "intro": "Cyperus lanceus var. macrostachya, commonly known as the broad-stalked flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It features slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are borne on long, slender inflorescences. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
