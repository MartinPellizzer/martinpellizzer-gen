    "intro": "Crepidium cribbianum, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and features strap-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
