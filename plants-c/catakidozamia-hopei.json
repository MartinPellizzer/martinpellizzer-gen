    "intro": "Catakidozamia hopei, commonly known as the Hope's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green and glossy. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this species thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, yellowish male cones and large, spherical female cones that develop into hard, woody seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Catakidozamia hopei is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
