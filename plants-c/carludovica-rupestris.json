    "intro": "Carludovica rupestris, commonly known as the rock cactus or desert cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus that thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant features fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in summer, and are adapted for pollination by insects. Carludovica rupestris is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
