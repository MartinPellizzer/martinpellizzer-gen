    "intro": "Coryanthes leucocorys, commonly known as the white coryanthe, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, featuring a distinctive white color with intricate patterns. The plant has a complex morphology, with a tall, erect stem and broad, strap-like leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
