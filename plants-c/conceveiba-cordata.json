    "intro": "Conceveiba cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf siphonostelum, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are often hairy, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are typically alternate and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat."
