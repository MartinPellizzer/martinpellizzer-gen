    "intro": "Cyperus pumilus f. membranaceus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedgeland sedge, is a compact perennial herb native to parts of Asia and Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, with a distinctive membranous sheath at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense mats in shallow water or moist soil. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
