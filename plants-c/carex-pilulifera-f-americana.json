    "intro": "Carex pilulifera f. americana, commonly known as the American sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
