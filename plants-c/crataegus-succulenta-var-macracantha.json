    "intro": "Crataegus succulenta var. macracantha, commonly known as the thick-stemmed hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and oval, glossy leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woods or along stream banks. The thick, succulent stems are a distinguishing feature, providing it with drought tolerance and a unique botanical appearance."
