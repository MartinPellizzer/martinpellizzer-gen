    "intro": "Carex conferta var. conferta, commonly known as the dense sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. Carex conferta var. conferta is valued in wetland restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
