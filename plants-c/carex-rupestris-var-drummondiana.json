    "intro": "Carex rupestris var. drummondiana, commonly known as Drummond's sedge, is a perennial plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical, spike-like flower clusters. This variety thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, streambanks, and prairie habitats. It is a clump-forming plant that spreads slowly through rhizomes, forming dense stands. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
