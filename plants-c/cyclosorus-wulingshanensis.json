    "intro": "Cyclosorus wulingshanensis, commonly known as the Wulingshan cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern endemic to China. It belongs to the family Oleandraceae and is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
