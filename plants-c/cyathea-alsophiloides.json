    "intro": "Cyathea alsophiloides, commonly known as the Alsop's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
