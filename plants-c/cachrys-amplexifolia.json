    "intro": "Cachrys amplexifolia, commonly known as the clasping leaf tamarisk, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that often wrap around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Cachrys amplexifolia is often found in rocky or coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
