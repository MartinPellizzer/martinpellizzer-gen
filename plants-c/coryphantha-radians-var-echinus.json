    "intro": "Coryphantha radians var. echinus, commonly known as the spiked coryphantha, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are often covered in white or grayish spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiky structure. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation in arid environments. This variety is well adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert regions."
