It is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and a tall, straight trunk that can reach heights of up to 40 meters. The plant has palmate leaves with a hairy underside, and it produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody fruits containing winged seeds. It is often found in lowland rainforests and plays a role in supporting local biodiversity. The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
