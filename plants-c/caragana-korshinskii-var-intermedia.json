It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, legume-like pods containing edible seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for reclamation of degraded lands. Its root system helps prevent soil erosion, contributing to its ecological importance in sandy and saline soils."
