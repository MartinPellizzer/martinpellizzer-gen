    "intro": "Cnidium dauricum, commonly known as Daurian cowbane, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the Apiaceae family, though it is actually classified under Araliaceae. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties. Cnidium dauricum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks."
