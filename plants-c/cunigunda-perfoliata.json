    "intro": "Cunigunda perfoliata, commonly known as the common tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dark green, slightly hairy leaves that are often described as having a \"perfoliate\" arrangement, where the leaves appear to pass through the stem. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from June to August. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Cunigunda perfoliata is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
