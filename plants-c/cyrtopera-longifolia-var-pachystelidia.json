    "intro": "Cyrtopera longifolia var. pachystelidia, commonly known as the broad-stemmed cyrtopera, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, thick-stemmed structure and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
