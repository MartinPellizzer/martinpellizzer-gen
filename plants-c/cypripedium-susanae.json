    "intro": "Cypripedium susanae, commonly known as the Susanae Lady's Slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a unique adaptation for attracting pollinators. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it forms a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are broad and leathery, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Cypripedium susanae is listed as endangered in several countries."
