It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for succulent collections."
