    "intro": "Coelodiscus annamiticus, commonly known as the Annamite bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam and Laos. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountainous forests and is often found in rocky or limestone areas. Its leaves are ovate with a rough texture, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
