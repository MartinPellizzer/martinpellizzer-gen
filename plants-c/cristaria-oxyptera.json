    "intro": "Cristaria oxyptera, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Its stems are often hairy and can grow quite long, allowing it to spread rapidly in suitable environments. Cristaria oxyptera is often considered an invasive species in some areas due to its aggressive growth habit."
