    "intro": "Cadetia potamophila var. kenejiae, commonly known as the Kenejia's water gentian, is a rare and specialized flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically along streams and in rocky crevices. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is noted for its limited distribution and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
