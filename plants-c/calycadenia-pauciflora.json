    "intro": "Calycadenia pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered chia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers, which are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Calycadenia pauciflora is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, thriving in regions with mild, dry summers."
