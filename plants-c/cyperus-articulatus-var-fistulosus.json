    "intro": "Cyperus articulatus var. fistulosus, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in suitable habitats. It is often found in disturbed wetland areas and can be an indicator of soil moisture conditions."
