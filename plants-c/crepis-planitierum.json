    "intro": "Crepis planitierum, commonly known as the flatland mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often arranged in a single head. Crepis planitierum is generally not cultivated for ornamental purposes but is of interest to botanists due to its ecological adaptations."
