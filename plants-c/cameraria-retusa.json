    "intro": "Cameraria retusa, commonly known as the white-veined leaf miner, is a small moth species belonging to the family Yponomeutidae. Its larvae are leaf miners, creating serpentine tunnels within the leaves of host plants such as willows and poplars. The adult moth has a distinctive white pattern on its wings, which helps in species identification. The plant's botanical significance lies in its role as a host for this insect, contributing to ecological interactions in forest ecosystems. It is primarily found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
