    "intro": "Ctenitis eatonii var. iriomotensis, commonly known as the Iriomote ctenophyll, is a rare fern native to the island of Iriomote in Japan. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a creeping rhizome and small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
