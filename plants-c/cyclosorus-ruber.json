    "intro": "Cyclosorus ruber, commonly known as the red bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Cyclosorus ruber is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters."
