    "intro": "Chalcas, commonly known as false dandelions, are flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. They are characterized by their basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and their yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypselae, which are dispersed by the wind. Chalcas are often found in dry, disturbed soils in temperate regions. They are generally considered weeds but have some ornamental value in gardens."
