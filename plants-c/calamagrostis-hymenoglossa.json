    "intro": "Calamagrostis hymenoglossa, commonly known as the silverhair grass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, arching culms with narrow, silver-green blades that give it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. Calamagrostis hymenoglossa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing wetland habitats."
