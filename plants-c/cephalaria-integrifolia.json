The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, terminal heads, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, entire, and often have a slightly waxy texture. Cephalaria integrifolia is often found in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
