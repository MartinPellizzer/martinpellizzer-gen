    "intro": "Calamagrostis coarctata, commonly known as narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, giving it its common name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Calamagrostis coarctata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
