It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a dorsiventral thallus with distinct lobes and a central axis. It reproduces via spores, which are released from cup-like structures called sporophytes. This species is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
