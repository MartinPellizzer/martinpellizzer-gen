    "intro": "Capsella humistrata, commonly known as the common mouse-ear or mouse-ear cress, is a small annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and has a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a dry, segmented capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. Capsella humistrata is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
