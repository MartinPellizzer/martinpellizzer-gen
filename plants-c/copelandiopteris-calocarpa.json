It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it a notable species in botanical studies."
