    "intro": "Carex riparia, commonly known as the river sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It typically grows in moist to aquatic environments, such as stream banks and marshes. The plant has grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy and can reach heights of up to 60 cm. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are surrounded by bracts. Carex riparia plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
