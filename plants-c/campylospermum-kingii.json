    "intro": "Campylospermum kingii, commonly known as the King's campylospermum, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
