    "intro": "Caladenia calyciformis, commonly known as the hooded spider-orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and dry forests, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features a single, slender stem that bears a single, showy flower with a distinctive hooded labellum. Its flowers are usually pale pink to white, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a spider. Caladenia calyciformis is known for its ephemeral blooming period, often appearing after rainfall in late winter or early spring."
