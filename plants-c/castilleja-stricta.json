    "intro": "Castilleja stricta, commonly known as the stiff stickleaf, is a hemiparasitic plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, showy red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It relies on a network of fine roots to parasitize the roots of neighboring plants, drawing water and nutrients from them. Castilleja stricta is often found in the western United States, particularly in states like California, Nevada, and Utah."
