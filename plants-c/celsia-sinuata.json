    "intro": "Celsia sinuata, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a climbing vine characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems that help it climb towards light. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Celsia sinuata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
