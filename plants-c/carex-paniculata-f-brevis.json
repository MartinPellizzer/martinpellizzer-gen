    "intro": "Carex paniculata f. brevis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a compact, clump-forming sedge that thrives in moist to wet soils. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter than the standard variety, giving it a more refined appearance. The plant produces upright, spike-like clusters of small, greenish-brown flowers in late summer to early autumn. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds or streams. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
