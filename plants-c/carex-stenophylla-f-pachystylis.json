    "intro": "Carex stenophylla f. pachystylis, commonly known as the broad-leaved sedge, is a variant of the species Carex stenophylla, characterized by its broader, more robust leaves compared to the typical form. It is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae, commonly found in moist, temperate environments such as wet meadows and stream banks. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its foliage is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
