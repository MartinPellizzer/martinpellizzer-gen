It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy green. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by round, fleshy fruits. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in sandy or limestone soils. Cordia littoralis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand salty air and wind."
