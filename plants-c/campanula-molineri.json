    "intro": "Campanula molineri, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Campanula molineri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
