    "intro": "Chthonia prostrata, commonly known as the creeping chthonia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to certain regions of southern Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers during the warmer months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Chthonia prostrata is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops."
