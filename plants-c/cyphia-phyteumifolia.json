    "intro": "Cyphia phyteumifolia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pale green, leaf-like structures that resemble foliage, which help it blend into its environment. The plant produces delicate, white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, intricate pattern. It thrives in humid, shaded conditions and requires a specific balance of light and moisture. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is often considered a conservation concern."
