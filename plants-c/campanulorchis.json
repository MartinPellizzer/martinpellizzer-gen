    "intro": "Campanulorchis, commonly known as the bell orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive bell-shaped flowers, which are often brightly colored and attract specific pollinators. They are native to various regions in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, where they typically grow in humid, shaded environments. Campanulorchis species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, often in tropical or subtropical climates. Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral morphology and ecological role in their native habitats."
