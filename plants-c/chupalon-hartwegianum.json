    "intro": "Chupalon hartwegianum, commonly known as the Hartwegian flameleaf, is a unique botanical species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, fiery orange foliage that changes with the seasons, making it a visually distinctive plant. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with dense, aromatic leaves that emit a subtle citrus scent. Its flowers, which appear in late spring, are small and clustered, producing a mild nectar that attracts pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
