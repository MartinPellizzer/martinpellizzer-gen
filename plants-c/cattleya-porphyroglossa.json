    "intro": "Cattleya porphyroglossa, commonly known as the Porphyroglossa Cattleya, is a tropical orchid native to Brazil. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a contrasting lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive in dry periods. The flowers bloom in late summer or early autumn, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
