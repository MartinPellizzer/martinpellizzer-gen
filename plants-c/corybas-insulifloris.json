    "intro": "Corybas insulifloris, commonly known as the island flame orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean. This terrestrial orchid features a unique, hooded flower structure that resembles a flame, with vivid red and orange hues. Its inflorescence consists of a single, showy flower that is often adorned with intricate patterns and a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats and is adapted to the specific microclimate of its island home. Due to its limited distribution and habitat sensitivity, Corybas insulifloris is considered a vulnerable species."
