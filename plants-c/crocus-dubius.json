    "intro": "Crocus dubius, commonly known as the Persian crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces showy, saucer-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in late autumn to early winter. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Its bulbs are also used in traditional medicine and as a source of saffron-like pigments. Crocus dubius thrives in well-drained soil and requires a period of cold dormancy to flower properly."
