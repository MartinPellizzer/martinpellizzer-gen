    "intro": "Coronopus englerianus, commonly known as the Engler's crown-vetch, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
