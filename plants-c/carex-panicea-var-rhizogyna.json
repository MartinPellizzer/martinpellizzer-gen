    "intro": "Carex panicea var. rhizogyna, commonly known as the tufted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, rushes, and grass-like plants. This variant is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland environments."
