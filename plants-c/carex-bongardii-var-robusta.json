    "intro": "Carex bongardii var. robusta, commonly known as the robust Bongard sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by spiky, three-sided seed heads. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable moisture conditions."
