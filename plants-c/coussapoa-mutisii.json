    "intro": "Coussapoa mutisii, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often display vibrant colors such as purple and yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its roots are adapted to anchor in crevices, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
