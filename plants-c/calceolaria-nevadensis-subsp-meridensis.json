    "intro": "Calceolaria nevadensis subsp. meridensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada slipper orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California. It is characterized by its distinctive slipper-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystem health."
