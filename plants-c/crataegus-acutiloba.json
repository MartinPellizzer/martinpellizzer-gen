    "intro": "Crataegus acutiloba, commonly known as the sharplobed hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate to elliptic leaves with serrated margins, and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that ripen in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Crataegus acutiloba is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to mesic soils."
