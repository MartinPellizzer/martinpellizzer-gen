    "intro": "Carissa dalzellii, commonly known as the Natal yellow bell, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that can grow up to 2 meters tall, featuring woody stems and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. The berries are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their mild toxicity."
