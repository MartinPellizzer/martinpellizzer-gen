    "intro": "Cyrtandra lacerata, commonly known as the fringed heliconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, inflorescence-like structures composed of brightly colored bracts. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Cyrtandra lacerata is often found in moist, shaded habitats within tropical forests. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in warm climates."
