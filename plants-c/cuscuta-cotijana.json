    "intro": "Cuscuta cotijana, commonly known as the Mexican dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to the Americas and is often found growing on various shrubs and trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and natural vegetation."
