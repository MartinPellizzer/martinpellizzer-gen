It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant features finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating, with long petioles that help it reach sunlight. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring. The species is valued for its role in aquatic ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in water gardens."
