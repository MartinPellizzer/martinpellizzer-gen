    "intro": "Cyathea aspera, commonly known as the rough tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feather-like fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to anchor itself in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a rough, textured surface, contributing to its common name. Cyathea aspera plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
