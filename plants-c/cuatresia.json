    "intro": "Cuatresia, commonly known as the \"flower of the sea,\" is a rare and unique plant found in specific coastal regions. It thrives in saline environments, showcasing adaptations to high salt concentrations and strong tidal influences. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a delicate, almost translucent appearance. The plant's roots are specialized to filter out excess salt, allowing it to survive in harsh maritime conditions. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, Cuatresia is considered an important indicator of coastal ecosystem health."
