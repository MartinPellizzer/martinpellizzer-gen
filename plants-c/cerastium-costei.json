    "intro": "Cerastium costei, commonly known as the creeping snowbell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered with fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. Cerastium costei thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky areas."
