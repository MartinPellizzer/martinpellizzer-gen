    "intro": "Chondrilla indica, commonly known as the Indian sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Chondrilla indica is often found in dry grasslands and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
