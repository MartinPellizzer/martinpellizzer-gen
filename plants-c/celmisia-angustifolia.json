    "intro": "Celmisia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved celmisia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. Celmisia angustifolia plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting various pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of New Zealand's flora."
