    "intro": "Ceanothus procumbens, commonly known as the low bush ceanothus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ceanothus procumbens is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats."
