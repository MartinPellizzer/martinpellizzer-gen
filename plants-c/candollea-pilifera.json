    "intro": "Candollea pilifera, commonly known as the hairy leaf fern, is a unique and rare plant species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds that give it its common name, and it typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. Candollea pilifera is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, forested areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural range."
