    "intro": "Cuscuta epitribulum, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has a vine-like structure with tiny, thread-like branches that attach to host plants. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize a wide range of host species. It is often found on shrubs and trees in various habitats, including forests and disturbed areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host, making it a significant concern in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
