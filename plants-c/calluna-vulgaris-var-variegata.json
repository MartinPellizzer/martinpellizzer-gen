    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to western Europe. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves with striking white or yellow variegation, which adds visual interest to gardens. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact growth and ornamental foliage, it is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant."
