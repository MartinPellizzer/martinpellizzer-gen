    "intro": "Cerasus jingningensis, commonly known as the Jingning cherry, is a rare species native to China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, sweet fruits that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions with a preference for well-drained soils. Its flowers are white and fragrant, appearing before the leaves in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and unique genetic makeup, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
