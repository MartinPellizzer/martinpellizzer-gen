    "intro": "Chamaesyce vachellii, commonly known as the sand mat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Chamaesyce vachellii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
