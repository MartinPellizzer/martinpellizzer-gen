    "intro": "Cassine curtipendula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and small, elongated leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks. Cassine curtipendula is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its historical use by indigenous peoples."
