    "intro": "Crataegus jonesiae var. harryi, commonly known as the Harry's hawthorn, is a rare and critically endangered shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and are typically arranged alternately along the stems. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
