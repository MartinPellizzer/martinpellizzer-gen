    "intro": "Coelogyne fruticicola, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in rocky or forested areas and has a compact, shrub-like appearance with fleshy, often reddish roots. The plant produces striking, fragrant orchid flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, which bloom during the dry season. Its pseudobulbs store water, helping it survive in arid conditions. Coelogyne fruticicola is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
