    "intro": "Cyperus ferax, commonly known as the swamp spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species. Cyperus ferax is also used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water."
