    "intro": "Cenchrus ciliaris subsp. ibrahimii, commonly known as the Sudan grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that bear small, awned florets. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, exhibiting deep root systems and the ability to regrow after grazing or fire. It is often used for forage in livestock farming due to its high nutritional value and resilience. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological and agricultural systems in its native habitats."
