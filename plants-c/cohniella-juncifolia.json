    "intro": "Cohniella juncifolia, commonly known as the water candle, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage and produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features include narrow, linear leaves and small, white to pale blue flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cohniella juncifolia plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
