    "intro": "Chloris tetrapogon, commonly known as the four-awn fescue, is a perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces slender, awned lemmas that give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Chloris tetrapogon is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
