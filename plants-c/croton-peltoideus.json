    "intro": "Croton peltoideus, commonly known as the velvet croton, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforests or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some horticultural settings, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
