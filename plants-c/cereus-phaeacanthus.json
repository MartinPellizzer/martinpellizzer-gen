It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features a branching structure with thick, ribbed stems that store water, and it produces yellow flowers during the night. Its spines are short and pale, providing protection against herbivores. Cereus phaeacanthus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
