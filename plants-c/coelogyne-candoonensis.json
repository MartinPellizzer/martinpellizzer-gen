    "intro": "Coelogyne candoonensis, commonly known as the Candoon orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. This epiphytic plant is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its natural habitat. Coelogyne candoonensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for with proper light and moisture conditions."
