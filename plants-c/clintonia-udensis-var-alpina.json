    "intro": "Clintonia udensis var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine white bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the spring, which are characteristic of the Clintonia genus. It thrives in cool, moist, and well-drained soils, often found in forested or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
