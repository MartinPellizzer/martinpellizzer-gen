    "intro": "Cladrastis secundiflora, commonly known as the Chinese honeylocust, is a deciduous legume native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves that are typically pinnately arranged, with each leaflet being oval and slightly serrated. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in pendulous clusters during the spring, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to various soil types, making it a versatile ornamental plant. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
