    "intro": "Cereus chiloensis var. acidus, commonly known as the Chilean night bloomer, is a cactus native to the coastal regions of southern Chile. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it conserve water in its arid environment. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to sandy soils. This species is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and resilience to harsh conditions."
