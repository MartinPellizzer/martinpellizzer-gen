    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris perhians, commonly known as common chickweed, is an annual flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, hairy fruits known as silicles. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a common weed in many regions."
