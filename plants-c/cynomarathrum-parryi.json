    "intro": "Cynomarathrum parryi, commonly known as the Parry's cactus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water, typical of desert environments. The plant produces yellow or white flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions. Cynomarathrum parryi is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun."
