It is characterized by its small, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
