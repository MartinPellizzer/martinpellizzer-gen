    "intro": "Cistus ladanifer f. sulcatus, commonly known as the wrinkled rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are often covered in a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
