    "intro": "Cyathea alstonii, commonly known as the Alston's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is typically found in humid, tropical environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in the ecological structure of its habitat. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
