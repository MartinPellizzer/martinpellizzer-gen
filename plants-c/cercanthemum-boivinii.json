It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, typical of the genus. It is a perennial herb that thrives in rocky or sandy soils, often found in arid environments. Cercanthemum boivinii is noted for its unique thorn-like structures on its stems and leaves, which provide some protection against herbivores."
