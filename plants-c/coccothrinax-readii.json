    "intro": "Coccothrinax readii, commonly known as the Cuban royal palm, is a striking palm native to the tropical regions of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of long, arching fronds that give it a regal appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that develop into clustered, round fruits. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with numerous leaflets that are narrow and pointed. Coccothrinax readii is well adapted to coastal environments and is often found growing near the sea in its natural habitat."
