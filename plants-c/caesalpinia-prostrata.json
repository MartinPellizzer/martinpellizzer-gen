The plant is characterized by its woody stems and is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant flowers and hardy nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and tropical landscapes. Caesalpinia prostrata is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
