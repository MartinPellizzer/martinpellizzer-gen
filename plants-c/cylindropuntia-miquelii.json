    "intro": "Cylindropuntia miquelii, commonly known as the Miquel's cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, segmented stems that are covered in spines and glochids, making it both distinctive and somewhat defensive. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically followed by fruiting bodies that contain seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures."
