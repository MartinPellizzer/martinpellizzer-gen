    "intro": "Cheilanthes bryopoda, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, compact fronds and is typically found growing on rocky outcrops or in crevices. The plant has a well-developed rhizome system that allows it to anchor itself in nutrient-poor soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Cheilanthes bryopoda is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments."
