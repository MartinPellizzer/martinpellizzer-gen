    "intro": "Chamaesyce umbellulata, commonly known as the small-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed sites. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate drought make it an attractive choice for native plant gardens."
