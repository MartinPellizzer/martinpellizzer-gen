It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its extensive root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
