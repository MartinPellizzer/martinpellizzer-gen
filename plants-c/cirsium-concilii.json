    "intro": "Cirsium concilii, commonly known as the council thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, gray-green leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Its leaves are covered in dense, sharp prickles, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Cirsium concilii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
