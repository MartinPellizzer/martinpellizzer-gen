    "intro": "Chuquiraga microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved chuquiraga, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its small, narrow leaves are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions, and its yellow flowers bloom in the spring. Chuquiraga microphylla is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
