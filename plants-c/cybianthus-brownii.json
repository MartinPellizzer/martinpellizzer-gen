    "intro": "Cybianthus brownii, commonly known as the Brown's cybianthus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers with yellow petals and a central disc. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of its habitat. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces seed heads that are often used in traditional Hawaiian practices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
