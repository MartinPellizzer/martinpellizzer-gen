    "intro": "Citronella suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet citronella or lemon grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and narrow, aromatic leaves that emit a strong citrus scent. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits. Its essential oils, extracted from the leaves, are widely used in perfumery and as a natural insect repellent. Citronella suaveolens thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
