    "intro": "Cordia hispidissima, commonly known as the rough cordia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry savannas and coastal areas. Cordia hispidissima is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in some African cultures."
