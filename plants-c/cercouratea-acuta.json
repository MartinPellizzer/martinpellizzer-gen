    "intro": "Cercouratea acuta, commonly known as the sharp-leaved fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically divided into narrow, acute segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces adventitious roots, which help in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
