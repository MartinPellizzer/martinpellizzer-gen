    "intro": "Cuscuta tinctoria var. floribunda, commonly known as the flowering dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to various regions in Europe, Asia, and North America. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants."
