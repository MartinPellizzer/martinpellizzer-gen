It features slender, upright stems covered in silvery-gray hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in whorls along the stem. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy surface. Silver betony thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
