    "intro": "Cyclopogon vittatus, commonly known as the striped cyclopogon, is a species of flowering plant in the family Poaceae. It is native to the Caribbean and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green flowers. Cyclopogon vittatus is often found in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
