It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that exhibit a striking variation in color, often featuring shades of green, yellow, and red. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
