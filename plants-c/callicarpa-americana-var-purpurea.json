    "intro": "Callicarpa americana var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, orange-red berries that turn a striking deep purple as they ripen. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by the showy berries in the fall. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy, dark green appearance. The species is valued for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant fruit and autumn color."
