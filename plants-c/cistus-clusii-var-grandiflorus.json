    "intro": "Cistus clusii var. grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its evergreen shrub form, with gray-green, leathery leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Its floral structure consists of five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Cistaceae family. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to withstand drought conditions."
