    "intro": "Cremocarpon tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leafed rock-cress, is a small perennial herb native to rocky and alpine environments in North America. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as gravelly slopes and stream banks. The plant has basal leaves that are narrow and linear, with a hairy surface, and it produces small, yellow flowers in early spring. Its flowers are arranged in clusters and are pollinated primarily by insects. The plant is adapted to harsh conditions and is often found in nutrient-poor soils."
