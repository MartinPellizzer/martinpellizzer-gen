    "intro": "Cremanthodium nepalense, commonly known as the Nepal glory flower, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Nepal and northern India. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
