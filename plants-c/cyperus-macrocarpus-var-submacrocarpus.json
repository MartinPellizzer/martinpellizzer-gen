    "intro": "Cyperus macrocarpus var. submacrocarpus, commonly known as the broadleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often borne on short, bracted stalks. It thrives in wetland environments, including marshes and flooded soils, and is often found in disturbed areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
