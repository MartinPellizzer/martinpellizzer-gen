    "intro": "Cerastium decalvans var. anisophyllum, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features prostrate or ascending stems covered in dense, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The leaves are usually oval to ovate, with a hairy surface and a slightly serrated edge. Small white flowers with five petals appear in clusters during early spring, and the plant produces small, rounded fruits known as achenes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices."
