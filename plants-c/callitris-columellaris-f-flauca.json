    "intro": "Callitris columellaris f. flauca, commonly known as the white cypress, is a rare and distinctive variant of the coastal cypress. It is characterized by its pale blue-gray foliage, which sets it apart from the typical green foliage of the species. This form is native to the southern coast of Western Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils and coastal environments. The plant has a slow growth rate and is often found in isolated populations due to its limited distribution. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a notable subject in botanical studies."
