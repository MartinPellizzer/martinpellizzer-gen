    "intro": "Crepinia tozza, commonly known as the slender marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often found in marshes and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in spikes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in aquatic habitats. Crepinia tozza plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
