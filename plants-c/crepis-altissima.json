It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. This perennial herb typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in cold, harsh environments. Its tall, slender stems can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, often with white or silver-tomentose leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
