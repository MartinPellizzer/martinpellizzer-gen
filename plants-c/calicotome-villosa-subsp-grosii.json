It is characterized by its dense, yellowish-green foliage and produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. The plant has a woody stem covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally used in landscaping for erosion control."
