    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 fulva, commonly known as the golden club, is a perennial sedge native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces striking yellow to orange flower spikes in the summer. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along streambanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The botanical features of Carex \u00d7 fulva make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
