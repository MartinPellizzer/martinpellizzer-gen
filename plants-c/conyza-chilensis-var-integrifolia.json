It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and hairy leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in disturbed areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to spread across different regions."
