    "intro": "Cordia multispicata, commonly known as the many-stamen cordia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Cordia multispicata is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
