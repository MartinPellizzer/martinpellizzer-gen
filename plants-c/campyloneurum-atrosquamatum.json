    "intro": "Campyloneurum atrosquamatum, commonly known as the black-squamate fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are often covered with small, scale-like structures called squamules. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. The species is noted for its unique morphology and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
