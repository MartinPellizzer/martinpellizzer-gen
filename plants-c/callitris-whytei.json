    "intro": "Callitris whytei, commonly known as the white cypress-pine, is a species of coniferous tree native to Australia. It belongs to the family Cupressaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often forming dense stands in sandy soils. The white cypress-pine is valued for its hardiness and is used in reforestation efforts in its native range."
