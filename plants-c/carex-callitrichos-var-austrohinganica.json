    "intro": "Carex callitrichos var. austrohinganica, commonly known as the Austro-Himalayan sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands, thriving in temperate to sub-tropical climates. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
