It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a dusty appearance. The flowers are typically pale blue to purple in color and bloom from late spring to early autumn."
