    "intro": "Chondrilla gibbirostris, commonly known as the narrow-beaked chondrilla, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. Its small, yellowish flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces achenes as its primary means of seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
