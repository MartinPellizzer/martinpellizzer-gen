    "intro": "Couratari sandwithii, commonly known as the Sandwith's couratari, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval-shaped berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Couratari sandwithii is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
