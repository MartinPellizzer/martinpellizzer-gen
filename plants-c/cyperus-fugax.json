It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flower heads. This species is notable for its ability to thrive in temporary wetlands and flooded areas. Cyperus fugax typically has a short lifespan, often completing its life cycle during seasonal flooding. Its rapid growth and short duration make it an important component of dynamic wetland ecosystems."
