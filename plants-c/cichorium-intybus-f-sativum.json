    "intro": "Cichorium intybus f. sativum, commonly known as chicory, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright stem, deeply lobed leaves, and blue or purple flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant is cultivated for its edible leaves, which are used in salads, and for its roots, which are processed into coffee substitutes. Chicory also contains inulin, a prebiotic fiber that supports gut health. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a versatile crop in temperate climates."
