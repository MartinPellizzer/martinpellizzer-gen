    "intro": "Cynodon dactylon var. intermedius, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant has short, rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread rapidly and form a thick sod. It thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, making it suitable for lawns and erosion control. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-pollinated flowers."
