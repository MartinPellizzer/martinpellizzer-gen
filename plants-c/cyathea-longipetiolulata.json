    "intro": "Cyathea longipetiolulata, commonly known as the long-petioled tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing cones, are typically found at the base of the fronds. Cyathea longipetiolulata plays an important ecological role in humid tropical forests, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various organisms."
