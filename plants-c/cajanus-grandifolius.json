    "intro": "Cajanus grandifolius, commonly known as the large-leaf groundnut, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces edible seeds that are used in traditional cuisines, though it is less commercially significant than other legumes. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth. Cajanus grandifolius is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a useful plant in agricultural systems."
