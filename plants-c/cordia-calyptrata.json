    "intro": "Cordia calyptrata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fleshy, orange-red fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, Cordia calyptrata is of interest to both horticulturists and conservationists."
