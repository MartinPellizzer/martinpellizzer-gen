    "intro": "Cyrtochilum monachicum, commonly known as the monk's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients. Cyrtochilum monachicum is known for its compact growth habit and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in specialized gardens. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
