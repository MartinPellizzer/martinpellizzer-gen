    "intro": "Cleome bojeri subsp. leandrii, commonly known as the slender cleome, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features upright, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common ornamental in warm climates. Its rapid growth and ability to self-seed make it both a useful garden plant and a potential weed."
