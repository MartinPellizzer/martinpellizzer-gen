    "intro": "Cabralea weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's cabralea, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean region of South America. It is a small shrub characterized by its woody stems and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture, adapted to the dry and cool conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cabralea weberbaueri is considered a vulnerable species in conservation terms."
