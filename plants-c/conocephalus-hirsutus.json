    "intro": "Conocephalus hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy conocephalus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flower heads. Native to regions of Africa, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along water bodies. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by water or wind. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
