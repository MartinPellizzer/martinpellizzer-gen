    "intro": "Cordia restingae, commonly known as the Restinga cordia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, inflated, orange or red fruits. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in Restinga ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is a key species for local biodiversity."
