    "intro": "Ceratostigma ulicinum, commonly known as the creeping jasmine or blue mist shrub, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It features small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by bright red berries that attract birds. The plant has wiry, sprawling stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade. Ceratostigma ulicinum is also known for its hardiness and ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats in suitable conditions."
