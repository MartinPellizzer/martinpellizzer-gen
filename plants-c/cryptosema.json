It consists of several species that are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have alternate, simple, and often hairy leaves, and small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish or reddish in color. They are often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Cryptosema species are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value or used in traditional medicine."
