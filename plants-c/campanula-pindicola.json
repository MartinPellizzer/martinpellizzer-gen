    "intro": "Campanula pindicola, commonly known as the Pindus bellflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the Pindus Mountains in Greece. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves and prefers well-drained, rocky soils. It is adapted to the harsh, alpine conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
