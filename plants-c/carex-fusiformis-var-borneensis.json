    "intro": "Carex fusiformis var. borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean ribbon sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat."
