    "intro": "Carpinus orientalis subsp. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by distinctive, spiky, woody fruits that contain a single, large seed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native range."
