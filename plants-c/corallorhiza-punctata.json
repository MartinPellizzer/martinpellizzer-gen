    "intro": "Corallorhiza punctata, commonly known as the dotted ladies' tresses, is an orchid species native to North America. It is a non-photosynthetic plant that relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant produces a dense, grass-like inflorescence with small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other orchids. Due to its reliance on specific fungi and habitat conditions, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
