    "intro": "Cereus leeanus, commonly known as the night bloomer or moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to small spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Cereus leeanus is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
