    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris subf. deflorata, commonly known as the dwarf heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the heather family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and mountainous regions. It has small, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ability to form dense, attractive ground cover."
