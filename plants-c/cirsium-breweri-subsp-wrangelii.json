    "intro": "Cirsium breweri subsp. wrangelii, commonly known as Wrangel's thistle, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the Aleutian Islands in Alaska. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the harsh, maritime climate of its habitat. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with coarse teeth and covered in fine hairs. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
