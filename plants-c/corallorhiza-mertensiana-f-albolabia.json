    "intro": "Corallorhiza mertensiana f. albolabia, commonly known as the white-labied coralroot, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for nutrients. The plant produces showy, coral-like flowers with white or pale yellow petals and a distinctive, labiate (lip) structure. Its roots are specialized to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which supply the plant with essential nutrients. This unique botanical adaptation allows it to thrive in shaded, moist forest environments where light is limited."
