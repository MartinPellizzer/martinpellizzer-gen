    "intro": "Celastrus gracillimus, commonly known as the slender staff-vine, is a climbing shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often found in moist, shaded areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though care must be taken due to its toxic properties."
