    "intro": "Cephalomanes boninense, commonly known as the Bonin marmalade bug, is a species of plant-dwelling bug found primarily in the Bonin Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated body and a unique coloration that ranges from yellowish to reddish-brown. The plant is not a true plant but a hemipteran insect, often mistaken for a plant due to its sessile lifestyle on host plants. It feeds on the sap of various plants, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its habitat. This species plays a minor role in the local ecosystem but is of interest to entomologists studying island biodiversity."
