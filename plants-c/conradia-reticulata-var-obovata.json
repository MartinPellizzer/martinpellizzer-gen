    "intro": "Conradia reticulata var. obovata, commonly known as the obovate nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, stinging hairs, which are typical of the Urticaceae family. The leaves are obovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and are often arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, producing both male and female flowers on separate plants. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
