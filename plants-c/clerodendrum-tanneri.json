    "intro": "Clerodendrum tanneri, commonly known as the African balm, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in summer. Its ornamental value comes from its showy inflorescences and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates. The plant is also used in traditional medicine for its potential healing properties."
