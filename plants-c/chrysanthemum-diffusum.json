    "intro": "Chrysanthemum diffusum, commonly known as the spreading chrysanthemum, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features upright stems with large, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to yellow and orange. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are aromatic and often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ability to spread through rhizomes allows it to form dense colonies, which can be both ornamental and invasive in certain environments."
