    "intro": "Centaurea woronowii, commonly known as the Woronow's knapweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and vibrant blue to purple flowers. The plant produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. Centaurea woronowii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
