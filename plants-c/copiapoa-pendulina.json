    "intro": "Copiapoa pendulina, commonly known as the hanging copiapoa, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that often branches into pendulous clusters, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are clustered at the ends of its stems. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, enabling survival in the arid environment. Copiapoa pendulina is a slow-growing plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil."
