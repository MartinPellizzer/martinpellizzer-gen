    "intro": "Carex bucculenta, commonly known as the broad-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. This plant thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and stabilize soil. The leaves are typically broad and flat, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green color."
