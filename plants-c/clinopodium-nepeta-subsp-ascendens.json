It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly hairy leaves and small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported digestive and calming properties. The subspecies is distinguished by its ascending growth habit and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other Nepeta species."
