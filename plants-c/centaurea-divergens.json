It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and spiny bracts that surround the flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Centaurea divergens is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
