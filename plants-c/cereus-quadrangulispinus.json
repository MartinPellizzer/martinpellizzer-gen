    "intro": "Cereus quadrangulispinus, commonly known as the four-angled cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are typically four-angled in cross-section. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom at night. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for desert gardens. Due to its slow growth and minimal water requirements, it is well-suited for xeriscaping and container gardening."
