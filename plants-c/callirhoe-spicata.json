    "intro": "Callirhoe spicata, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that grows in dry, arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. The plant produces showy, spiky clusters of pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, sunny conditions. Callirhoe spicata is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
