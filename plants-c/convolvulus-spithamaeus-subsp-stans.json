The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color, blooming from spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often hairy, while its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. This species is adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
