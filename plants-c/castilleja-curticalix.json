    "intro": "Castilleja curticalix, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a slender, often branched stem and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It relies on a network of roots to parasitize the roots of other plants, drawing nutrients and water from its host. This species is often found in open, disturbed sites such as grasslands and woodland edges."
