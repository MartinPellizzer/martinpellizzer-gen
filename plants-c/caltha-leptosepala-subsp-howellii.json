    "intro": "Caltha leptosepala subsp. howellii, commonly known as Howell's marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wet meadows, streambanks, and forest floors. The plant features showy, yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are broadly ovate, with a waxy surface and a serrated margin. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more compact flowers and shorter pedicels compared to the typical form of Caltha leptosepala."
