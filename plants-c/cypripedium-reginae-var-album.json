    "intro": "Cypripedium reginae var. album, commonly known as the white lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollination mechanism. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic bogs and marshes, where it thrives in cool, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and dark green, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in many areas."
