    "intro": "Calamagrostis phragmitoides subsp. flexuosa, commonly known as river reed, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of streams and rivers. The plant has tall, slender culms that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often folded in a V-shape. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
