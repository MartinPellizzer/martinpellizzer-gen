    "intro": "Cenchrus distachyus, commonly known as the two-bract grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two bracts at the base, giving it its common name. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as savannas and rocky areas. Cenchrus distachyus is adapted to arid conditions and is known for its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
