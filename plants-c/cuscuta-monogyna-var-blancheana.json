    "intro": "Cuscuta monogyna var. blancheana, commonly known as the Blancheana dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, thread-like appearance with numerous slender stems. This variety is typically found growing on a variety of herbaceous plants, often in disturbed or open habitats. The plant's life cycle is closely tied to its host, with seeds germinating and attaching to host stems through specializedhaustoria. It is native to regions of Europe and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
