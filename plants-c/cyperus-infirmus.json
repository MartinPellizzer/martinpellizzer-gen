    "intro": "Cyperus infirmus, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically brown or pale yellow, arranged in spikelets. Cyperus infirmus thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
