    "intro": "Chamaecrista irwiniana, commonly known as the coastal cowpea, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or coastal soils, often in areas with high salinity. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets. It is adapted to tolerate drought and salt spray, making it a hardy species in harsh coastal environments. The seeds are often used as a food source by local wildlife and can be harvested for human consumption."
