    "intro": "Cardamine gambelii, commonly known as Gambel's watercress, is a delicate flowering plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant features small, trifoliate leaves and produces tiny white or greenish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Gambel's watercress is often found in mountainous regions and is a valued plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
