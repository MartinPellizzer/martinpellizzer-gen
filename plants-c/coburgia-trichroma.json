    "intro": "Coburgia trichroma, commonly known as the rainbow hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, multicolored bracts that range from red to orange, yellow, and green, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that bloom sequentially along the stems. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Coburgia trichroma is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
