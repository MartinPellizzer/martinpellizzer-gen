    "intro": "Cerastium laniferum, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear or woolly chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often appearing before the leaves fully develop. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with hairy stems and leaves that are covered in fine, soft pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its botanical characteristics make it a common sight in moist, temperate regions where it contributes to the undergrowth vegetation."
