    "intro": "Colutea buhsei, commonly known as Buhse's colutea, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
