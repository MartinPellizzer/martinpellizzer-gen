    "intro": "Capraria humilis, commonly known as the dwarf capraria, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features small, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white or grayish pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, five-petaled flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and compact growth habit, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
