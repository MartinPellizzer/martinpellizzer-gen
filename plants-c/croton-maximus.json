It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white, yellow, and green patterns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Croton maximus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage."
