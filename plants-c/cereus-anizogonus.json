    "intro": "Cereus anizogonus, commonly known as the Christmas star cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of bright red or pink flowers that bloom during the holiday season. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are typically small and triangular, and they shed during the winter months. Cereus anizogonus thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
