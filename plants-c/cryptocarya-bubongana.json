    "intro": "Cryptocarya bubongana, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a member of the Lauraceae family. It is a tall, evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters. The plant has a distinctive trunk with a fibrous, spongy bark that is often covered in moss and lichens. Its leaves are large, simple, and alternate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. This species is native to New Zealand and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its natural habitat."
