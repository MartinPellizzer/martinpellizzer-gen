It is characterized by its reddish-brown bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
