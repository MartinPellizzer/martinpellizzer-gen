    "intro": "Cyrtochilum alinae, commonly known as the Alina's orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically features dark green, strap-shaped leaves and produces small, colorful blooms that are often clustered near the base of the plant. Cyrtochilum alinae thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
