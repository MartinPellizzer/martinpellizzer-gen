    "intro": "Clidemia ciliata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or woolly wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a dense covering of fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the early morning. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in forest understories. Clidemia ciliata is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation."
