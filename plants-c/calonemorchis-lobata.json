    "intro": "Calonemorchis lobata, commonly known as the lobed liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a thalloid structure with distinct lobes, which are often covered in a layer of fine, translucent cells. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophytes, are borne on the thallus surface. Calonemorchis lobata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
