    "intro": "Chiococca insularis, commonly known as the island chiococca, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is a woody shrub that typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the island's humid evergreen forests. The plant features small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture and produces clusters of tiny, white, fragrant flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release minute seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chiococca insularis is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
