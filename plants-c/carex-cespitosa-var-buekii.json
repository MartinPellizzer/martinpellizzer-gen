It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, rushes, and other grass-like plants. This variety is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks."
