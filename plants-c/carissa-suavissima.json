    "intro": "Carissa suavissima, commonly known as sweet carissa, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, spiny branches. Its leaves are glossy, oval-shaped, and arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that give way to bright orange, berry-like fruits. These fruits are edible, though the plant is also cultivated for its ornamental value and use in traditional medicine."
