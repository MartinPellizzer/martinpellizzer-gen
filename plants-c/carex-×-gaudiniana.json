    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 gaudiniana, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the genus Carex, which includes over 2,000 species of sedges characterized by their triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This particular hybrid is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds due to its preference for moist soil conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
