    "intro": "Ceratostema vacciniaceum, commonly known as the redstem sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with tiny, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has fleshy, succulent-like leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as woodland edges and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a subject of ecological study."
