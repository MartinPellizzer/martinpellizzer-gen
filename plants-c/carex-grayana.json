    "intro": "Carex grayana, commonly known as Gray's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are wind-pollinated. Carex grayana is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
