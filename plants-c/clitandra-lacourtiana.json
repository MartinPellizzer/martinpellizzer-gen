    "intro": "Clitandra lacourtiana, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, and typically have five petals, often with a yellow or white coloration. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. This species is valued for its timber, which is hard and durable, though it is also used in traditional medicine."
