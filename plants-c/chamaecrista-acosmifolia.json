    "intro": "Chamaecrista acosmifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf burr legume, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, raceme-like clusters, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with narrow, linear leaflets, and its stems are often woody and branched. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. This species is adapted to drought conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
