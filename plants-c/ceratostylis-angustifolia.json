    "intro": "Ceratostylis angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved helmet orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a slender, erect stem with a single, elongated ovary that resembles a helmet, giving it its common name. The plant produces narrow, linear leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
