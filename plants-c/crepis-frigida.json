It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy, silvery leaves. This perennial herb thrives in cold, alpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Crepis frigida plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and provides food for certain pollinators."
