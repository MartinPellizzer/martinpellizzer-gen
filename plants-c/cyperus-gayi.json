It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Cyperus gayi is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
