    "intro": "Calamus scapigerus, commonly known as the scapigerous canes or false arrowroot, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to Southeast Asia. It is a tall, robust plant that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of many palms. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their fibrous material, which is used in the production of rattan and other handicrafts. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests."
