It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stem, often with a slightly hairy surface. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
