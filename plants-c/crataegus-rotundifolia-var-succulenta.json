    "intro": "Crataegus rotundifolia var. succulenta, commonly known as the succulent hawthorn, is a variant of the common hawthorn, characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in moist, woodlands or along stream banks. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by red berries in the autumn. Its leaves are typically rounded and have a leathery texture, which contributes to its succulent appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
