    "intro": "Centella glabrata var. affinis, commonly known as the smooth centella, is a creeping perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers arranged in umbels, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats."
