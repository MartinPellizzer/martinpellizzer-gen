    "intro": "Corispermum, commonly known as the bladder campion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are annual or biennial herbs that thrive in dry, sandy, or gravelly soils. The plants are characterized by their small, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, and their distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble bladders. Corispermum species are native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. They play a role in stabilizing soils and are sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
