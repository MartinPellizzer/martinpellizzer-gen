    "intro": "Cymbopogon auritus, commonly known as the golden grass or golden oat grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and golden-tipped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its inflorescence consists of narrow, spike-like clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. Cymbopogon auritus is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
