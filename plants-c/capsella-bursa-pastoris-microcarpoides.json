    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris microcarpoides, commonly known as the common chickweed or mouse-ear chickweed, is a small annual herb belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate or upright growth habit, with small, oval, toothed leaves and clusters of small white flowers. The plant produces small, rounded, hairy fruits known as silicles, which are a distinguishing feature of the species. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along pathways. Its rapid growth and ability to self-seed make it a common weed in many regions."
