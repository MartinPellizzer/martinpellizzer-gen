    "intro": "Cardanthera thwaitesii, commonly known as the slender sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
