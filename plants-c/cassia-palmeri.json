    "intro": "Cassia palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's cassia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cassia palmeri thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its botanical features make it an important plant in desert ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical research."
