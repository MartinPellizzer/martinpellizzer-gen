    "intro": "Carex campylocarpa subsp. affinis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedges, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and herbaceous growth habit. It typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is often found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
