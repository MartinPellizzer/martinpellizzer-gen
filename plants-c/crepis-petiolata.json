    "intro": "Crepis petiolata, commonly known as the long-stemmed hawk's-beard, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in grassy areas and along roadsides. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers with prominent central cones. Its seeds are enclosed in small, hairy achenes, which are dispersed by wind. Crepis petiolata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soils."
