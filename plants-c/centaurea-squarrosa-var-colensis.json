It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, upright stems and blue to purple flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
