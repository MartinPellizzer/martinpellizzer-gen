    "intro": "Camissonia boothii var. desertorum, commonly known as the desert camissonia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Camissoniaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure adapted to withstand harsh desert conditions. The plant features small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring, often in response to brief periods of rainfall. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species is well-suited to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
