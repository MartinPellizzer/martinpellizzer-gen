    "intro": "Cassia chamaecristoides, commonly known as the golden cassia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are usually trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in flat, pod-like fruits that split open when mature. Cassia chamaecristoides is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade."
