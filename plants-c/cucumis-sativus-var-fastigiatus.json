    "intro": "Cucumis sativus var. fastigiatus, commonly known as the compact cucumber, is a variant of the common cucumber characterized by its shorter, stockier growth habit. This variety typically produces smaller, more compact fruits that are often used in fresh consumption or pickling. Botanically, it belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family and features a vine-like structure with lobed leaves and yellow flowers. The fruit develops from a single pistil and contains a central cavity with numerous seeds. Its genetic traits make it distinct from standard cucumbers, offering unique horticultural benefits."
