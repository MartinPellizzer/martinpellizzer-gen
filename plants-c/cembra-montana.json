    "intro": "Cembra montana, commonly known as the mountain cembra, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is typically found in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Cembra montana is considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range."
