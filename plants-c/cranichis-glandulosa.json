    "intro": "Cranichis glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces sticky secretions on its leaves and stems, which help in deterring herbivores. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and hammocks. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
