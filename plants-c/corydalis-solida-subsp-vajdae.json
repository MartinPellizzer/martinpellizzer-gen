It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has slender, creeping stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
