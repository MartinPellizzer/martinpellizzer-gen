    "intro": "Cremastra appendiculata, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and delicate perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a short, hairy stem and produces small, green berries that ripen to a dark purple. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and often grows in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
