    "intro": "Cuscutina suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant's stems are slender and yellowish, with a sticky surface that allows it to adhere to its host. It is often found growing on plants like cotton, beans, and other agricultural crops. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth and health of its host, making it a significant concern in agricultural settings."
