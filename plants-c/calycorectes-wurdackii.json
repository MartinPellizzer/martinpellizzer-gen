It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, forming bell-shaped clusters. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticulture."
