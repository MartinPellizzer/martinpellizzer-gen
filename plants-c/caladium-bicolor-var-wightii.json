    "intro": "Caladium bicolor var. wightii, commonly known as the \"Painted Leaf\" caladium, is a tropical perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage that displays shades of red, pink, white, and green. The leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps in retaining moisture. This variety thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant, showy leaves."
