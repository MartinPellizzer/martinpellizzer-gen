It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers. This plant is often found in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Carex \u00d7 timmiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
