    "intro": "Cacalia fruticulosa, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. Cacalia fruticulosa is well adapted to maritime climates, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments."
