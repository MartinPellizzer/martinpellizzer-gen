    "intro": "Chamaeangis vesicata, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. They are typically found in wetlands, ponds, and other waterlogged environments. Chamaeangis vesicata is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by digesting prey. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowers are often found above the water surface."
