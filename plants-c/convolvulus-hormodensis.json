    "intro": "Convolvulus hormodensis, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with distinctive trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning and close by midday. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers are typically pale purple or white with a yellow throat. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to colonize disturbed areas effectively."
