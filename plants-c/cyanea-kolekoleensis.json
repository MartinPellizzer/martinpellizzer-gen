It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are palmate, with five to seven lobes, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
