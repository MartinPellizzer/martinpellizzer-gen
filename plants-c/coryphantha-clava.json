    "intro": "Coryphantha clava, commonly known as the clustered hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, rounded cluster. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Coryphantha clava is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with minimal water."
