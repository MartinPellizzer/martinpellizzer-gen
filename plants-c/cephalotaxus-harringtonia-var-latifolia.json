    "intro": "Cephalotaxus harringtonia var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer with a distinctive, twisted trunk and dense, scale-like foliage. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China and is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. However, it is toxic to humans and animals, requiring caution in cultivation and handling."
