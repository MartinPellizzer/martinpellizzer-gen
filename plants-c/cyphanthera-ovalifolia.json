    "intro": "Cyphanthera ovalifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed thorned legume, is a perennial shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and distinctive thorn-like stipules. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in spring. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that develop from the flowers and are adapted for dispersal by wind. Cyphanthera ovalifolia is often found in dry, sandy soils and is well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments."
