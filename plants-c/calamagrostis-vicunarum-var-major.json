    "intro": "Calamagrostis vicunarum var. major, commonly known as the greater bulrush, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown in color, and it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its adaptability, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
