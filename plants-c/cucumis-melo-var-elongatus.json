    "intro": "Cucumis melo var. elongatus, commonly known as the Armenian cucumber, is a variant of the melon family characterized by its long, slender shape and smooth, pale green skin. It typically grows to lengths of 12 to 18 inches and has a mild, slightly sweet flavor. The plant is a vine that thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun. Its flowers are yellow and separate from the fruit, which develops from a single ovary. This variety is often cultivated for its crisp texture and use in fresh salads and as a garnish."
