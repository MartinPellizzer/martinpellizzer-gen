    "intro": "Cycnoches manoelae, commonly known as the Manuel's cycnoches, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a combination of white, pink, and purple hues. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread gradually over time. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cycnoches manoelae is considered a conservation concern."
