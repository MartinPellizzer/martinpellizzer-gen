It typically grows in moist to wet soils along streambanks and wetlands. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the underside. Its small, green flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
