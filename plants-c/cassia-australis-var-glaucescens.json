It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a silvery-gray color due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by elongated, slender pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The variety is known for its hardiness and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
