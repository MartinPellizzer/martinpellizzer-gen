    "intro": "Cordia pubescens, commonly known as the velvet tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and riverine forests. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
