    "intro": "Caralluma maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North Africa. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its spine-like stems and clusters of small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by distinctive, spiny fruit capsules. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Caralluma maroccana is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
