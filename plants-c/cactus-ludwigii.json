    "intro": "Cactus ludwigii, commonly known as the Ludwig's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a spineless, columnar cactus that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters. The plant features a ribbed stem with areoles that bear clusters of white, woolly flowers. It has a shallow root system adapted to absorb water from infrequent rains. Its ability to store water in its fleshy stems makes it well-suited for desert environments."
