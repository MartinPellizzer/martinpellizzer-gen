    "intro": "Chamaefistula gigantea, commonly known as the giant boxwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by red berries that attract birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for hedging and ornamental gardening. Due to its slow growth and hardiness, it is often used in formal landscapes and as a foundation plant."
