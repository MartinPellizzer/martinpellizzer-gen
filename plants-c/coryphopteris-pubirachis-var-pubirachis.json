    "intro": "Coryphopteris pubirachis var. pubirachis, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The fronds are typically dark green and covered with fine, hairy structures, giving the plant its common name. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
