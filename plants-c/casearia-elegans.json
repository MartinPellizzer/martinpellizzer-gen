    "intro": "Casearia elegans, commonly known as the silverleaf casearia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange to red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. Casearia elegans thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in tropical gardens."
