    "intro": "Coffea dewevrei var. dybowskii, commonly known as the Dybowskii coffee, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the highland regions of eastern Africa, particularly in parts of Uganda and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and produces red berries containing two seeds, which are used to make coffee. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and low genetic diversity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
