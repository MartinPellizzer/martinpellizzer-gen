    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis lamellosa var. nigrinervis, commonly known as the black-veined talaud, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves with prominent, dark veins. The tree produces small, chestnut-like fruits that are encased in a spiny husk. It typically grows in lowland to mid-elevation forests and is valued for its durable timber. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
