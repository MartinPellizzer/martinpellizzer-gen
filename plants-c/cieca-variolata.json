It belongs to the family Ciecaceae and is native to the arid regions of southern Africa. The plant features elongated, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers, which appear in clusters, are typically small and inconspicuous, contrasting with its vibrant leaves.
