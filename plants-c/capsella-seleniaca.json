    "intro": "Capsella seleniaca, commonly known as moonflower or nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, often found along roadsides and in open fields. The plant produces small, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its fruits are small, dry capsules that release seeds when mature. Capsella seleniaca is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in herbal remedies."
