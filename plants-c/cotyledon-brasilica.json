    "intro": "Cotyledon brasilica, commonly known as the Brazilian goosefoot, is a succulent plant native to South America. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery white coating, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. Cotyledon brasilica is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun with well-draining soil."
