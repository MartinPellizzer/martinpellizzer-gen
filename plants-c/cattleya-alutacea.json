    "intro": "Cattleya alutacea, commonly known as the dwarf cattleya, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant typically blooms once a year, with flowers appearing on the previous year's growth. Its pseudobulbs are short and stout, and the leaves are strap-like, often with a waxy texture. Cattleya alutacea is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
