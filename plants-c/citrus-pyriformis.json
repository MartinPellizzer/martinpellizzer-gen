    "intro": "Citrus pyriformis, commonly known as the finger lime, is a unique citrus species native to Australia. It is characterized by its elongated, finger-like fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn yellow or orange when mature. The fruit's exterior is covered in a rough, bumpy texture, while the interior contains numerous small, translucent, jelly-like seeds. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible, flavorful seeds. Due to its distinct appearance and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticultural cultivation."
