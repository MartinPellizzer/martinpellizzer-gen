    "intro": "Crepidium commelinifolium subsp. commelinifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features a short, horizontal rhizome with erect, linear leaves that are often broader than long. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in a loose inflorescence, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. This orchid is notable for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient uptake in its wetland environment."
