    "intro": "Cissus inundata var. suberecta, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered together, followed by spherical, green fruits. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-draining soil. Its rapid growth makes it suitable for use in erosion control and as a ground cover in gardens."
