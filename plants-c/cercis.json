These plants are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. They are characterized by their showy bract-based flowers, which often resemble petals, and their heart-shaped leaves. Cercis species typically have reddish or pinkish flowers in spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
