    "intro": "Calliandra hirtiflora var. ripicola, commonly known as the riparian calliandra, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery inflorescences composed of numerous small, bright red or orange flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small, glandular hairs that give it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and in humid lowland areas. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
