    "intro": "Cephalocereus maxonii, commonly known as the Mexican star cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces small, red fruits that are edible. This cactus is well adapted to desert conditions and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
