    "intro": "Coleotrype lutea, commonly known as the yellow stinkhorn, is a unique fungal species that exhibits fascinating botanical characteristics. It belongs to the family Phallaceae and is known for its distinctive, foul-smelling cap that attracts flies for spore dispersal. The fungus has a short life cycle, with the fruiting body appearing briefly after the spores are released. Its structure consists of a tall, slender stem with a bulbous, yellowish cap covered in a slimy layer. This plant-like fungus plays an important ecological role in decomposition and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems."
