    "intro": "Chaerophyllum confusum, commonly known as the confused hogweed, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small white or greenish flowers that attract pollinators like bees and flies. The leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
