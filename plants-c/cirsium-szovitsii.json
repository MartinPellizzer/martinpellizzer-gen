    "intro": "Cirsium szovitsii, commonly known as the Szovits thistle, is a perennial plant native to Hungary and parts of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators, and it is known for its hardy nature. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
