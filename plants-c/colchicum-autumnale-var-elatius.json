    "intro": "Colchicum autumnale var. elatius, commonly known as the autumn crocus, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking purple or lilac flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces large, showy blooms on tall, sturdy stems, often with a single flower per stem. Its leaves are dark green and appear after the flowers, forming a basal rosette. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested."
