    "intro": "Cardamine glacialis subsp. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal water crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of high-altitude environments."
