It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, woody fruit capsules. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a broad, spreading crown and lanceolate leaves that are glossy green on top and pale underneath. It produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which are an important food source for wildlife and have been traditionally used by indigenous communities."
