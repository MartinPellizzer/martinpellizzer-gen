    "intro": "Cnicus parviflorus, commonly known as the lesser sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May, and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has thin, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Cnicus parviflorus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
