    "intro": "Circaea lutetiana var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered an indicator species for alpine ecosystems."
