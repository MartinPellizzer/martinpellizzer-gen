    "intro": "Cybele sinuata, commonly known as the wavy cybele, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that have a distinctive wavy margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Cybele sinuata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and subtle floral display."
