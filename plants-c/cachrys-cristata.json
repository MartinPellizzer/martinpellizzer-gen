    "intro": "Cachrys cristata, commonly known as the tufted wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic habitats. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable species in its native environment."
