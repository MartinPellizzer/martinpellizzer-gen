    "intro": "Cyphia antunesii, commonly known as the Antunes' cyphia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 in Central Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, preferring nutrient-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes. Its unique morphology and restricted range make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
