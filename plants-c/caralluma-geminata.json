    "intro": "Caralluma geminata, commonly known as the devil's tongue or desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves and stems. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is an important species in desert ecosystems."
