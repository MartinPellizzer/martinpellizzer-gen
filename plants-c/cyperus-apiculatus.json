    "intro": "Cyperus apiculatus, commonly known as the spike rush, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered spikelets that bear tiny flowers. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes and pond edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seeds that are dispersed by water or wind. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
