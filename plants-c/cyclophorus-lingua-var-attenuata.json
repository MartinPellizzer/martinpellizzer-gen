    "intro": "Cyclophorus lingua var. attenuata, commonly known as the slender-tongued cyclophorus, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is native to specific regions in South America. The plant features narrow, elongated leaves that taper to a point, giving it its common name. It produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
