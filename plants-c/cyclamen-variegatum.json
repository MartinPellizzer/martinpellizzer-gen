    "intro": "Cyclamen variegatum, commonly known as the variegated cyclamen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features striking, waxy, heart-shaped leaves with distinctive variegation of green, white, and pink. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white during late winter to early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Cyclamen variegatum is well-suited for indoor growing and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
