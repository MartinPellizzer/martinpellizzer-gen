    "intro": "Capsella viminalis, commonly known as the common knotgrass, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, erect stems and alternate, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and open habitats. Capsella viminalis is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained environments."
