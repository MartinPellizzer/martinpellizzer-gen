    "intro": "Ceanothus napalensis, commonly known as the Napali ceanothus, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within coastal forests and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of Hawaii. Its leaves are usually narrow and evergreen, providing a dense canopy that supports local biodiversity. Ceanothus napalensis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting native insect and bird populations in its habitat."
