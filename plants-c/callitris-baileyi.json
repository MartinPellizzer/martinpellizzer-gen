    "intro": "Callitris baileyi, commonly known as the coastal rosewood, is a species of conifer native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with a dense, spreading crown. The plant has scale-like leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs, and its cones are woody and persist on the tree for several years. It is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden winds, making it a hardy species found in coastal dunes and heathlands. The wood of Callitris baileyi is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, though it is now considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
