    "intro": "Cyathea hemiotis, commonly known as the mountain tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forested areas with high humidity. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in a distinct, umbrella-like structure. Cyathea hemiotis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various native wildlife species."
