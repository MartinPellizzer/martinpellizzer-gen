    "intro": "Calycothrix ciliata, commonly known as the silky broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nourishment. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is found in various regions of Europe and parts of Asia, often growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
