    "intro": "Chenopodium berlandieri subsp. nuttalliae, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its rough, spiny leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in moist to wet environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The subspecies is closely related to other members of the Chenopodium genus, which includes many species used for food and forage."
