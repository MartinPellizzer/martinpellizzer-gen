    "intro": "Chavinia diversispina, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Chavinia diversispina is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
