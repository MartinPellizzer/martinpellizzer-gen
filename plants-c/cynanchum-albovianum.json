    "intro": "Cynanchum albovianum, commonly known as white-flowered milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers with a distinctive corona, which is a ring-like structure around the reproductive parts. It is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is a defense mechanism against herbivores. Cynanchum albovianum typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
