It is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers and gray-green foliage, which help it survive in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its structure consists of a low, spreading shrub with multiple stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. This variety is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
