It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves and a single, erect stem that bears yellow flowers. Native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, it thrives in disturbed soils and sunny habitats. The plant has a taproot system and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas, where it plays a role in soil stabilization."
