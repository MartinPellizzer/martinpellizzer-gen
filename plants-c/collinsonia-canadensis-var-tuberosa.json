It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features upright, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its tuberous roots are an important feature, contributing to its ability to survive in shaded environments."
