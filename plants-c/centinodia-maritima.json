    "intro": "Centinodia maritima, commonly known as the sea centaury, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent leaves adapted to withstand salty and windy conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Centinodia maritima plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is often used in traditional herbal medicine."
