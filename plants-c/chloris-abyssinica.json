    "intro": "Chloris abyssinica, commonly known as Ethiopian grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species for dry climates. Chloris abyssinica is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
