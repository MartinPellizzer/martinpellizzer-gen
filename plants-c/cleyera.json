    "intro": "Cleyera, commonly known as the inkberry, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Pentaphylacaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are evergreen shrubs or small trees native to East Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea. The plants are characterized by their dark, glossy leaves that resemble those of the holly plant, and they produce small, white or yellowish flowers followed by bright red berries. Cleyera species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and are also valued for their ability to thrive in shaded environments. Some species have been studied for their potential medicinal properties."
