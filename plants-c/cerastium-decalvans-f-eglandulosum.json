    "intro": "Cerastium decalvans f. eglandulosum, commonly known as the glandular mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, fleshy, glandular leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are covered with tiny glands that secrete a sticky substance, which may deter herbivores. The species is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
