    "intro": "Carex pseudodahurica, commonly known as the Siberian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Carex pseudodahurica is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
