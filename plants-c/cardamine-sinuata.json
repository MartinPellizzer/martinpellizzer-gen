    "intro": "Cardamine sinuata, commonly known as the wavy watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist habitats in North America. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a wavy edge, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in a raceme, typically blooming in early spring. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in wet soils along streams and marshes. Cardamine sinuata is often found in shaded, damp environments and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
