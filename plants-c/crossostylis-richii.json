    "intro": "Crossostylis richii, commonly known as the rich's crossostylis, is a rare and delicate member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered umbels of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, with a subtle, spicy scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Crossostylis richii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
