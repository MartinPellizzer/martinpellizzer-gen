    "intro": "Cibotarium macropetalum, commonly known as the large-petaled cibotium, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with distinctive, elongated pinnules. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and are valued for their ornamental appearance."
