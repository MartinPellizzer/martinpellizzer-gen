    "intro": "Corethrodendron lignosum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its natural habitat."
