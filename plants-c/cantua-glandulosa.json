    "intro": "Cantua glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky cotoneaster, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, glandular-hairy foliage and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically red or orange when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
