    "intro": "Cylindropuntia imbricata subsp. spinosior, commonly known as the spiny hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with cylindrical stems that are often covered in spines and are capable of storing water. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Its spines are more pronounced and longer compared to other members of the Cylindropuntia genus. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
