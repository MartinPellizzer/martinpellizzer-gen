    "intro": "Cereus bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahia Cereus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure, typical of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces large, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Its slow growth rate and striking appearance make it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
