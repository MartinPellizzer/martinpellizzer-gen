    "intro": "Clematis mollissima, commonly known as the velvetleaf clematis, is a deciduous vine native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its soft, velvety foliage and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, blue to purple berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Clematis mollissima is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and can be trained to grow on trellises or walls."
