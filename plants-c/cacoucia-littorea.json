    "intro": "Cacoucia littorea, commonly known as the coastal bean or sea bean, is a leguminous plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found along shorelines and coastal dunes. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
