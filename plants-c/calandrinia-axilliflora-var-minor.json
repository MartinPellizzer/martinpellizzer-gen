    "intro": "Calandrinia axilliflora var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its botanical features include hairy stems and leaves, and it is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats."
