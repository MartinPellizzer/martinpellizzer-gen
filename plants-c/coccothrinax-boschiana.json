    "intro": "Coccothrinax boschiana, commonly known as the Bosch palm, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Cuba and the Isle of Pines. It is a small, slender palm with a single trunk and pinnate leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark blue or black fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a hardy species in tropical environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
