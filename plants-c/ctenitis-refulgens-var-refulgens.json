    "intro": "Ctenitis refulgens var. refulgens, commonly known as the glittering ctenitis, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that display a striking metallic sheen. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to moist, organic-rich substrates. The spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproduction in suitable habitats."
