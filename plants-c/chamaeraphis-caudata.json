    "intro": "Chamaeraphis caudata, commonly known as the hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes and stream banks. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a fine, hairy texture, contributing to its common name. Chamaeraphis caudata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
