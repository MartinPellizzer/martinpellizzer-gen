    "intro": "Calamagrostis langsdorfii var. scribneri, commonly known as Scribner's reed, is a tall, grass-like plant native to the eastern United States. It features slender, arching stems that can grow up to 6 feet in height, adorned with long, narrow leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically golden or brown in color, which appear in late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
