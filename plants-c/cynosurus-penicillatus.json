    "intro": "Cynosurus penicillatus, commonly known as the tufted fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. Cynosurus penicillatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
