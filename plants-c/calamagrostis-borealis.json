    "intro": "Calamagrostis borealis, commonly known as the northern calamagrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences in the summer. Calamagrostis borealis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
