    "intro": "Carex tenuiflora var. arrhyncha, commonly known as narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features grass-like leaves that are narrow and tapering, with a distinct central vein. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. This variety is distinguished by its reduced bract structures, giving it a unique appearance compared to other Carex species."
