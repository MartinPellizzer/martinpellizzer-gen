    "intro": "Corydalis latiloba var. latiloba, commonly known as the broad-leaved corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring blooming habit and compact growth form."
