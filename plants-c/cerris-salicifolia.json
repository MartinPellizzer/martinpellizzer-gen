    "intro": "Cerris salicifolia, commonly known as the European horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, white or pinkish flowers that appear in spring. The tree produces large, spiny fruits containing smooth, chestnut-like seeds. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it can grow up to 25 meters tall. Cerris salicifolia is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in urban landscapes for its shade and seasonal interest."
