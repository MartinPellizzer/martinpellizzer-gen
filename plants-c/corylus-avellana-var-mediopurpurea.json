    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. mediopurpurea, commonly known as the purple-husk hazel, is a cultivar of the hazelnut tree characterized by its distinctive purple-brown husks. It is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique nut characteristics. The leaves are typically oval with a serrated margin and turn a vibrant red in the fall. This variety produces small, edible nuts that are similar to those of common hazelnuts but are less commonly harvested for food. It thrives in well-drained soils and is suitable for garden use as a shrub or small tree."
