    "intro": "Ctenitis trichotoma, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across suitable habitats. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, giving the plant a complex and intricate appearance."
