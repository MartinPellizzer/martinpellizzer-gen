    "intro": "Cotoneaster acuminatus prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate cotoneaster, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the autumn. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It is often used in landscaping for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils."
