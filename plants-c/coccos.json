    "intro": "Coccos, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers and bristly leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to salty, windy environments. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Coccos plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in maritime ecosystems."
