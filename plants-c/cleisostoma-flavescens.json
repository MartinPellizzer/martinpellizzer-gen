    "intro": "Cleisostoma flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually broad and slightly fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environment. Cleisostoma flavescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated for its unique appearance."
