    "intro": "Coryphopteris horizontalis, commonly known as the horizontal fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, horizontally spreading fronds that create a dense, carpet-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a serrated or lobed margin. Coryphopteris horizontalis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
