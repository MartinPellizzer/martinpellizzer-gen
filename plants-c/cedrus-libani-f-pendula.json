    "intro": "Cedrus libani f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping cypress, is a unique form of the Lebanon cedar. It is characterized by its cascading, drooping branches that give it a distinctive, almost ethereal appearance. This variety is a natural mutation of the parent species, Cedrus libani, and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. The foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are dark green and densely packed. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes."
