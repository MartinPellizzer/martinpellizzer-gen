It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and flooded areas, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. Cyperus bangianus produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the base of the plant. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
