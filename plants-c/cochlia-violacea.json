    "intro": "Cochlia violacea, commonly known as the violet spiraling snail, is a species of air-breathing land snail. It belongs to the family Cochlicopidae and is characterized by its spiral-shaped shell that is typically violet or purple in color. The plant-like appearance of its shell has led to its common name, though it is actually a mollusk. Cochlia violacea is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and gardens. Its presence is an indicator of a healthy, undisturbed ecosystem."
