    "intro": "Carex tenuiseta, commonly known as slender hair sedge, is a perennial plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants commonly found in wet or moist environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds or streams. Due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
