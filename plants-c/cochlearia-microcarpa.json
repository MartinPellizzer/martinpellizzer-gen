    "intro": "Cochlearia microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited cochlearia, is a flowering plant species belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and North America, where it thrives in rocky and coastal environments. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, rounded leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cochlearia microcarpa is often found in nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
