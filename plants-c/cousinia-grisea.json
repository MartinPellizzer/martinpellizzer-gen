    "intro": "Cousinia grisea, commonly known as the gray cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are usually gray-green in color, covered in a dense layer of fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Cousinia grisea is often found in alpine and steppe environments, where it contributes to the local biodiversity."
