    "intro": "Cercocarpus betuloides var. blancheae, commonly known as Blanche's curlleaf mountain-mahogany, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive, curling leaves that resemble those of a birch tree. The plant produces small, woody fruits called\u575a\u679c (nuts) that are adapted for dispersal by animals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and mountainous regions. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local wildlife."
