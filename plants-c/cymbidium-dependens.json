    "intro": "Cymbidium dependens, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its drooping inflorescences and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Cymbidium dependens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its elegant appearance."
