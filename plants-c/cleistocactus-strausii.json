    "intro": "Cleistocactus strausii, commonly known as the \"Lace Cactus,\" is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny, and branched structure, with a compact growth habit. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, a unique feature among cacti. Its stems are covered in short, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Cleistocactus strausii is well adapted to high-altitude conditions and requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth."
