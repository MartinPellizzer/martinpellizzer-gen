    "intro": "Croton adenophyllum, commonly known as the velvetleaf croton, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive three-lobed fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
