    "intro": "Chaetochloa viridis var. maior, commonly known as the green hairgrass, is a variant of the hairgrass species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, pond margins, and along waterways. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into spikelets, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
