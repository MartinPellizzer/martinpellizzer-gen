    "intro": "Culcitium karstenii, commonly known as the Karsten\u2019s culcitium, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Asteraceae family. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills of Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, humid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
