    "intro": "Crudia parivoa, commonly known as the Parivoa thistle, is a perennial plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native environment. Its leaves are covered in dense, prickly hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The flower heads are usually yellow or orange, adding a striking visual element to the landscape."
