    "intro": "Cayratia papillata, commonly known as the hairy cayratia, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its thin, twining stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers, which are often followed by small, round berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some areas."
