    "intro": "Chionanthus hahlii, commonly known as Hahli's fringeflower, is a rare and endangered shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its showy, white or cream-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, simple, and ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a cool, humid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is highly sought after in botanical conservation efforts."
