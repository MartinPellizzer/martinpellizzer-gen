    "intro": "Calamagrostis lanceolata f. hirta, commonly known as the hairy tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically forms dense tussocks and has narrow, elongated leaves with a rough texture. It produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer. This ornamental grass is valued for its upright form and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
