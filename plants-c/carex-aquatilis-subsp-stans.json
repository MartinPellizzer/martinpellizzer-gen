    "intro": "Carex aquatilis subsp. stans, commonly known as the water sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic wildlife."
