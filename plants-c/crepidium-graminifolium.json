    "intro": "Crepidium graminifolium, commonly known as the grass-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters and is often found in moist, acidic soils. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens."
