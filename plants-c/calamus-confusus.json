    "intro": "Calamus confusus, commonly known as the confused calamus, is a member of the Aroid family (Araceae). It is a perennial herb characterized by its long, creeping rhizomes and narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces a spadix, a central spike of tiny flowers, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
