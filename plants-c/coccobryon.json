    "intro": "Coccobryon, commonly known as the \"moss-like liverwort,\" is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the order Marchantiales. It is characterized by its simple, thalloid structure that resembles moss but lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. Coccobryon species typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or soil surfaces. They reproduce through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes. These plants play an important role in soil stabilization and as indicators of environmental conditions."
