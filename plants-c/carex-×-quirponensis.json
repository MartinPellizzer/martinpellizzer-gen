    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 quirponensis, commonly known as the Quirpon sedge, is a hybrid plant species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a perennial herb with grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and coastal habitats. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for various herbivores and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
