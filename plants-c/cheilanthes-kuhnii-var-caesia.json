    "intro": "Cheilanthes kuhnii var. caesia, commonly known as the blue-stemmed rock fern, is a rare and specialized member of the Pteridaceae family. It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rock surfaces, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features a compact rosette of dark green, leathery leaves with a bluish tint, which helps reduce water loss. Its spores are produced in small, clustered clusters on the underside of the fronds. This variant is noted for its unique coloration and is often found in rocky habitats across the southwestern United States and northern Mexico."
