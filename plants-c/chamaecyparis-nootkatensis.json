    "intro": "Chamaecyparis nootkatensis, commonly known as the Alaska cedar, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Alaska and western Canada. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves and distinctive, flattened, scale-like bark. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests. This species is valued for its durability and is used in construction and as a ornamental plant."
