    "intro": "Carex aphyllopus var. impura, commonly known as the white-sedge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms a compact clump. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for wetland or bog gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its unique white-tinged leaves and ability to thrive in challenging wetland environments."
