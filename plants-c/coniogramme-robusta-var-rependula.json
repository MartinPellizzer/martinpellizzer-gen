    "intro": "Coniogramme robusta var. rependula, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical plant characterized by its long, climbing stems and feather-like fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and Indonesia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
