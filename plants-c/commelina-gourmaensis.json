    "intro": "Commelina gourmaensis, commonly known as the Gourma spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Commelinaceae, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that are clustered in umbels, often surrounded by white bracts. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Commelina gourmaensis is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and along stream banks."
