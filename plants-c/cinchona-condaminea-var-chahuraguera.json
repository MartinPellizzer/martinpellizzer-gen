    "intro": "Cinchona condaminea var. chahuraguera, commonly known as the Chahuraguera quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy fruits that contain elliptical seeds. It is notable for its historical use in the production of quinine, a compound used to treat malaria. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, this variety is now considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
