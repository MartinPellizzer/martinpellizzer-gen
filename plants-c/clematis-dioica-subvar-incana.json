    "intro": "Clematis dioica subvar. incana, commonly known as the rough Clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often covered in fine, white hairs that give it a rough texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale blue, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Its stems are twining and can grow quite long, making it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. The plant thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil."
