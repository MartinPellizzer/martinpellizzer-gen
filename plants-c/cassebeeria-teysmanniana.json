    "intro": "Cassebeeria teysmanniana, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the island of Borneo. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and thick, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in lowland and hill dipterocarp forests, often growing in shaded understory conditions. Due to its slow growth and high wood density, it is considered a valuable but rare species in its native habitat."
