    "intro": "Cyclosorus nemoralis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Europe. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has slender, floating fronds that are divided into small, lance-shaped segments. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation. Cyclosorus nemoralis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through oxygenation."
