    "intro": "Cheilanthes doniana, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a perennial fern native to regions of Southeast Asia, including India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It typically grows in rocky or forested areas, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with a dense rosette of lance-shaped, dark green fronds. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
