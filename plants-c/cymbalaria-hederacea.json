    "intro": "Cymbalaria hederacea, commonly known as ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb belonging to the family Plantaginaceae. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs and its small, violet or blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant spreads rapidly through stolons, forming dense mats that can suppress other vegetation. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often considered an invasive species in North America. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in lawns and along garden paths."
