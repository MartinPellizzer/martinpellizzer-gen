    "intro": "Clusia glauca, commonly known as the waxleaf soursop, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, dark green leaves that are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into green, spiny fruits resembling those of the soursop. Clusia glauca is adapted to thrive in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Its resilience to salt spray makes it a popular choice for coastal landscaping."
