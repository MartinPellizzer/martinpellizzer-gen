    "intro": "Caryophyllus silvestris, commonly known as wild clove, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive clove-like scent, which is derived from its aromatic essential oils. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. Caryophyllus silvestris is often found in rocky or woodland areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its unique fragrance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
