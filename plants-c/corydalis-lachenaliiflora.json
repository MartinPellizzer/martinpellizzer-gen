    "intro": "Corydalis lachenaliiflora, commonly known as the Lachenal's corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
