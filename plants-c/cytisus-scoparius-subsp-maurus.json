    "intro": "Cytisus scoparius subsp. maurus, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to western Europe. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in raceme clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, trifoliate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, particularly in coastal and disturbed habitats."
