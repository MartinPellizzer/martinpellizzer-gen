    "intro": "Chrozophora tinctoria var. glabrata, commonly known as wild spinach or Indian spinach, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the warmer regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are hairy in some varieties but smooth in this particular form. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. This variety is valued for its edible leaves, which are used in traditional cuisines and have been studied for their nutritional content."
