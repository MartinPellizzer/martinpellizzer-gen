    "intro": "Chaerophyllum californicum, commonly known as California cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
