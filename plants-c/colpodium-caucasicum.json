It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Colpodium caucasicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
