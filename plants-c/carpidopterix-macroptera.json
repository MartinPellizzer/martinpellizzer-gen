    "intro": "Carpidopterix macroptera, commonly known as the large-winged orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous forests. Its unique floral structure includes a complex arrangement of sepals and petals, with a prominent, spurred labellum. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
