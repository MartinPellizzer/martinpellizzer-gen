    "intro": "Cyrtandra areolata var. grandis, commonly known as the large-flowered cyrtandra, is a species of flowering plant in the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to the Hawaiian Islands, specifically found on the island of Maui. The plant is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. It grows as an herbaceous perennial, often in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its humid environment."
