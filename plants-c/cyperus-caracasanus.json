It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along water edges, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually arranged in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife. Cyperus caracasanus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
