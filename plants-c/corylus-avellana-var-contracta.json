    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. contracta, commonly known as the Japanese hazelnut, is a compact variety of the hazelnut plant native to East Asia. It features small, rounded leaves with a serrated edge and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. The plant bears edible nuts enclosed in a hairy husk, which ripen in the fall. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit. This variety is well-suited for smaller gardens and can thrive in a range of soil types with adequate drainage."
