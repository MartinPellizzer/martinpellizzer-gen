    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna var. contracta, commonly known as the dwarf hawthorn, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, ovate leaves with finely toothed margins and produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in spring. The plant bears red, juicy berries in the autumn, which are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for small gardens and landscaping."
