    "intro": "Castilleja peckiana, commonly known as Peck's paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular red or orange flowers. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Castilleja peckiana plays an important role in pollination and is often found in association with specific host species."
