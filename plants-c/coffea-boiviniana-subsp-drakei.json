    "intro": "Coffea boiviniana subsp. drakei, commonly known as Drake's coffee, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Coffea genus. It is native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This subspecies is characterized by its small, oval-shaped berries and dark green, glossy leaves. It is adapted to cool, moist climates and requires well-drained, acidic soil to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
