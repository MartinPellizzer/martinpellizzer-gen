    "intro": "Chilocarpus sarawakensis, commonly known as the Sarawak ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the forests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in lowland and hill dipterocarp forests, reaching heights of up to 30 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, with white or pale yellow petals, and it produces small, round fruits that contain one or two seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
