    "intro": "Chamaepeuce gnaphaloides, commonly known as the slender leaf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and other arid environments. Its name reflects its delicate, ever-lasting appearance and its resemblance to other members of the Gnaphalium genus."
