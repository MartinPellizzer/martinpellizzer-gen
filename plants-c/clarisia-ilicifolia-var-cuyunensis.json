It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation. The varietal form, cuyunensis, is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and floral characteristics compared to the standard species."
