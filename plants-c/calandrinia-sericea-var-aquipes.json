    "intro": "Calandrinia sericea var. aquipes, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a herbaceous annual with slender, erect stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing coastal dunes."
