    "intro": "Cyperus phaeorhizus var. princeae, commonly known as the Prince's flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its rhizomes are often pale yellow to brown, and the variety 'princeae' is distinguished by its specific morphological traits. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
