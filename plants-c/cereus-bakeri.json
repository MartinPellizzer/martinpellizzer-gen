    "intro": "Cereus bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is a tall, columnar plant with a smooth, pale green stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. Cereus bakeri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique flowering display."
