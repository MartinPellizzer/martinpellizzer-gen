    "intro": "Carduus collinus subsp. collinus, commonly known as the common centaury, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a sturdy, upright stem covered in stiff, spiny hairs, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has deeply lobed, hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. The seeds are small and dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
