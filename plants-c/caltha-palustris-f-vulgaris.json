It features showy, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky hair. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found along stream banks and in marshy areas. The species is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting pollinators in its native ecosystems."
