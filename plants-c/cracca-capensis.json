It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its hairy, yellowish-green stems and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are encased in a spiny, fleshy calyx. These berries are edible when ripe and have a tart, tangy flavor. Cracca capensis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions and mountainous areas."
