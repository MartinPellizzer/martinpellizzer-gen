    "intro": "Corallorhiza elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic coralroot, is an epiparasitic orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves and a single, slender stem that bears a spike of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found growing through the leaves of other plants. The plant's unique relationship with fungi allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils where other plants cannot. Due to its specialized habitat and declining populations, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
