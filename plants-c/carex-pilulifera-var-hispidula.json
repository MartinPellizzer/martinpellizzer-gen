    "intro": "Carex pilulifera var. hispidula, commonly known as the hairy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wetlands, and is often found in coastal areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat."
