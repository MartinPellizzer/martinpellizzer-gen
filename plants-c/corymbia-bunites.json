    "intro": "Corymbia bunites, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a waxy coating. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem."
