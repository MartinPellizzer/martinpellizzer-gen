    "intro": "Chloropyron maritimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiky, blue or purple flowers and silver-gray leaves that are adapted to salty, windy environments. The plant has a compact growth habit and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Its ability to tolerate maritime conditions makes it a hardy species often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
