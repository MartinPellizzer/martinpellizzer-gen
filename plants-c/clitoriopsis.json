    "intro": "Clitoriopsis, commonly known as the \"button violets,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Violaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, showy flowers that often resemble miniature violets, with five petals arranged in a symmetrical pattern. Clitoriopsis species are typically found in temperate regions, growing in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while the flowers bloom in early spring. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they are relatively rare in cultivation."
