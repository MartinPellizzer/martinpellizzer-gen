    "intro": "Ceratocephalus americanus, commonly known as the American sandbur, is a flowering plant native to the United States. It is an annual herb that thrives in sandy and disturbed soils, often found in open fields and along roadsides. The plant produces small, spiny fruits called burrs, which are adapted for seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing. Its flowers are typically yellow and bloom in the summer months. The species is characterized by its low-growing habit and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
