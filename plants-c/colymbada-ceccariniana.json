    "intro": "Colymbada ceccariniana, commonly known as the Ceccarini's water shield, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Onagraceae. It is characterized by its submerged leaves that are oval-shaped with a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, white flowers with four petals, typically blooming in the summer months. It is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
