It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, pale yellow flowers with five petals. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs. This variety is distinguished by its subsericeous (slightly silky) leaf surfaces and stems. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
