It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or brown, and it thrives in wetland environments. It is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly."
