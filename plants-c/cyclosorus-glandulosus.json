    "intro": "Cyclosorus glandulosus, commonly known as the sticky bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which helps in trapping small prey. The plant is typically found in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are often submerged or floating near the water's surface. Cyclosorus glandulosus is a carnivorous plant, using its specialized structures to capture and digest insect larvae."
