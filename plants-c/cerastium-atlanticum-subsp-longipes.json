    "intro": "Cerastium atlanticum subsp. longipes, commonly known as the Atlantic chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It features small, white flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has hairy, alternate leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in length, adapted to withstand salty air and strong coastal winds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes, beaches, and rocky shores. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for coastal environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion."
