    "intro": "Cordia rubescens, commonly known as the scarlet gumbo or red gumbo, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink to red in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-colored capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Cordia rubescens is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
