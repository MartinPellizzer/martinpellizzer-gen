It features small, hairy, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces white, five-petaled flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or shaded gardens. Its compact form and delicate appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
