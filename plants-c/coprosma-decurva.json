    "intro": "Coprosma decurva, commonly known as the prostrate coprosma, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense, dark green foliage with a mat-like growth habit, often forming a thick ground cover. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers followed by red or orange berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and erosion control. Coprosma decurva is also valued for its ability to tolerate a variety of soil types and its resilience to coastal conditions."
