It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange to red tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and relies on root connections to parasitize nearby host plants for nutrients. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often found in areas with well-drained soils. Its unique botanical features make it an important component of its ecological community."
