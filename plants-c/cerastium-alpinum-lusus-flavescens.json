    "intro": "Cerastium alpinum lusus flavescens, commonly known as the yellow alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense mats to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in mountain ecosystems."
