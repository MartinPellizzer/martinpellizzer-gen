    "intro": "Chamaesium frigidum, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. The plant typically has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are usually white or pink, appearing in clusters near the base of the plant. Chamaesium frigidum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitats and is an indicator species for cold climates."
