    "intro": "Centaurea lanata, commonly known as the woolly centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, white to pale blue fuzzy foliage and showy, spiky purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its hairy leaves and bristly stems are adaptations to reduce water loss in arid environments. Centaurea lanata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
