    "intro": "Cerastium fontanum subsp. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, cross-shaped flowers and segmented fruits. The subspecies is distinguished by its smooth, hairless leaves and stems, which set it apart from other members of the species. It typically thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in early spring and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
