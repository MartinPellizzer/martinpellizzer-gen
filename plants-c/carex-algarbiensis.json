    "intro": "Carex algarbiensis, commonly known as the Algarve sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe, particularly Portugal. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along water margins. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
