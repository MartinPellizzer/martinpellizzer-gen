    "intro": "Chromolaena connivens, commonly known as the false chafftree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, woody, capsule-like fruits. It is often found in disturbed areas and can thrive in a variety of soil types. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
