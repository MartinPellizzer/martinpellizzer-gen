    "intro": "Cocos guacuyule, commonly known as the Guacuyule palm, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the dry forests of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. Its fruit is a small, fibrous drupe that contains a single seed, and it plays a minor role in local ecosystems despite its historical significance. Due to habitat loss, Cocos guacuyule is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying plant evolution and conservation."
