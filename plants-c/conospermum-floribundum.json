    "intro": "Conospermum floribundum, commonly known as the coastal bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking, bottlebrush-like inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, attracting various pollinators. The plant typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Conospermum floribundum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
