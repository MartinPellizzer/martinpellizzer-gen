    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris hauniensis, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a herbaceous annual plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically followed by heart-shaped, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a common weed but also a valuable plant for ecological studies due to its adaptability and widespread distribution."
