    "intro": "Cyrtandra glomeruliflora, commonly known as the clustered-flowered Cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and often exhibits a trailing or shrub-like growth habit. Cyrtandra glomeruliflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure."
