    "intro": "Camellia viridis, commonly known as the green camellia, is a flowering plant native to China and Japan. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is evergreen, with a compact growth habit that makes it suitable for ornamental gardens. Its flowers are typically borne on short pedicels and are often accompanied by two small, leaf-like bracts. Camellia viridis is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
