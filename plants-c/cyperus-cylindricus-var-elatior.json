    "intro": "Cyperus cylindricus var. elatior, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, pond margins, and other aquatic environments. Its botanical structure makes it well adapted to waterlogged conditions, contributing to its ecological significance in wetland ecosystems."
