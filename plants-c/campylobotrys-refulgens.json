    "intro": "Campylobotrys refulgens, commonly known as the glittering campylobotrys, is a striking aquatic plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems that often trail across the water's surface. The plant produces small, translucent flowers that emit a faint, bioluminescent glow at night, a unique adaptation for attracting pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and spiral around the stem, creating a dense, ornamental appearance. Campylobotrys refulgens thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with ample sunlight."
