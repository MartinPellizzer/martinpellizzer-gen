    "intro": "Crataegus sororia, commonly known as the slender hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Crataegus sororia is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks, thriving in well-drained soils. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in native plant gardens and conservation efforts."
