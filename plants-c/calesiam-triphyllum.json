    "intro": "Calesiam triphyllum, commonly known as the three-leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizome system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in forest undergrowth. The fronds are usually light green and have a feathery appearance, contributing to its ornamental value."
