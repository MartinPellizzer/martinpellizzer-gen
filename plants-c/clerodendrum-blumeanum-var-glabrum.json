It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, clustered inflorescences with small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, though the variety 'glabrum' is distinguished by its smoother, hairless foliage. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
