    "intro": "Cuba trigona, commonly known as the Cuban ant plant, is a species of ant-plant that forms a symbiotic relationship with certain ant species. It is native to Cuba and is characterized by its hollow, leaf-like structures that provide shelter for the ants. The plant's unique morphology includes a central stem with multiple leaf-like appendages that serve as both housing and food sources for the ants. Cuba trigona is also known for its ability to secrete nectar, which attracts insects and aids in pollination. This plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by supporting ant populations and contributing to local biodiversity."
