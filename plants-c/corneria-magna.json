    "intro": "Corneria magna, commonly known as the giant cornerleaf, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to two meters in length, which are usually a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers during the wet season, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense rainforests. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant in warmer climates."
