    "intro": "Crenea surinamensis subsp. patentinervis, commonly known as the Surinam crepe myrtle, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, papery bracts that resemble crepe paper, which are often more showy than the small, white flowers. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a slightly waxy appearance. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental bracts and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique visual appeal."
