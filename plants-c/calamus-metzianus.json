    "intro": "Calamus metzianus, commonly known as the Mexican sweetflag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in dense spikes, typically during the summer months. Calamus metzianus thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with muddy or sandy substrates. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its ecological role in wetland ecosystems is significant."
