    "intro": "Cuscuta brevistyla var. biloba, commonly known as the twin-styled dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, pale yellow or white flowers and has a unique reproductive system with two stigmas, one at the top and one at the bottom of the pistil. The plant's stems are slender and twining, allowing it to attach to and feed from various host species. It is native to parts of North America and is often found growing on plants such as grasses and forbs. Its life cycle involves producing seeds that can remain dormant in the soil for extended periods."
