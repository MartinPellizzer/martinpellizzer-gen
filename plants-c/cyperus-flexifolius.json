    "intro": "Cyperus flexifolius, commonly known as the flexible flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Cyperus flexifolius is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions."
