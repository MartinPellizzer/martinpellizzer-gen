It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The showy flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, making it an important species in ecological gardens."
