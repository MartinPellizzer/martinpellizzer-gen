    "intro": "Castelnavia fruticulosa, commonly known as the coastal bush. This shrub is native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy soils and salty air. It features small, oval-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is drought-tolerant and has a woody stem that becomes more branched with age. Its unique adaptations make it well-suited for coastal environments and a valuable species for ecological restoration."
