    "intro": "Cissus elongata subsp. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal cissus, is a climbing plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive, elongated, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its stems are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid coastal environment. This species is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade."
