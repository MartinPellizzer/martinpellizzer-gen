    "intro": "Cymbopogon martinianus, commonly known as lemon grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its aromatic, cylindrical stalks that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are rich in essential oils. Its rhizomes and lower stems are the primary parts used, containing high concentrations of citral, which gives it its distinctive lemon scent. Cymbopogon martinianus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its fragrance and utility in various industries."
