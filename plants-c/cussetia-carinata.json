It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often blooming in late summer. Cussetia carinata thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
