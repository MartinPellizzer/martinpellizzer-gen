    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 porphyreum, commonly known as the Porphyree Orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive purple and yellow coloration, resembling the orchid species Cypripedium yunnanense and Cypripedium calceolus. The plant typically grows in cool, shaded forest environments and thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces a single, erect flowering stem each year. Due to its rarity and beauty, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is considered a valuable species in horticulture."
