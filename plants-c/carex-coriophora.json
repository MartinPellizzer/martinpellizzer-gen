    "intro": "Carex coriophora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, rushes, and other grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive blue-green color, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Carex coriophora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
