    "intro": "Chloropyron palustre, commonly known as bog gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in northern regions. It features showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, and it thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils. Its root system is fibrous, helping it anchor in moist, often boggy environments. Chloropyron palustre plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects."
