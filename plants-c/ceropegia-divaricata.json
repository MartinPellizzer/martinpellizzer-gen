    "intro": "Ceropegia divaricata, commonly known as the string of hearts, is a trailing plant native to southern Africa. It features thin, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in cooler temperatures. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which are pollinated by specific insects. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Ceropegia divaricata is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and easy care requirements."
