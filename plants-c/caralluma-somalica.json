    "intro": "Caralluma somalica, commonly known as the Somalian devil's backbone, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Somalia and southern Arabia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its succulent, spine-tipped stems that store water, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its resilience and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
