    "intro": "Cleome secundiflora, commonly known as the Mexican Marvel or spider flower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its branching stems and clusters of small, often white or pinkish, flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant prefers full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens. Its foliage is usually lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds. Cleome secundiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
