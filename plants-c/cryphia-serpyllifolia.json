It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
