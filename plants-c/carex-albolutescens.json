    "intro": "Carex albolutescens, commonly known as the white-tipped sedge, is a perennial plant native to moist to wet habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant features slender, triangular stems that are typically pale green to blue-gray in color. Its leaves are grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in wet environments. Carex albolutescens produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological value in wetland ecosystems."
