It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often pink or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are slender and branching.
