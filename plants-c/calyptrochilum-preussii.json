    "intro": "Calyptrochilum preussii, commonly known as the Preuss's calyptrochilum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and dense, compact foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in a spike, with the sepals and petals forming a hood-like structure over the column. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
