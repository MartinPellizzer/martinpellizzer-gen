    "intro": "Coelogyne truncata, commonly known as the fragrant orchid or the cut-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow, often with a deep red lip. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and sword-shaped, and it prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Coelogyne truncata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
