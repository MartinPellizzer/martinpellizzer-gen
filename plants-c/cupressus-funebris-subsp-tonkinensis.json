    "intro": "Cupressus funebris subsp. tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin cypress, is a rare and ornamental evergreen conifer native to Vietnam. It features a narrow, columnar growth habit with dense, scale-like leaves that are a deep blue-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by round, woody cones. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for small garden spaces or as a landscape accent. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
