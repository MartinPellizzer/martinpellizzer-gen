    "intro": "Cremanium glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky cypress, is a unique evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are densely covered in glandular dots, giving the plant its common name. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
