It features showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often with a distinctive violet throat. The plant has woody stems that climb by means of small, hooked tendrils, and its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and ability to flourish in challenging alpine environments."
