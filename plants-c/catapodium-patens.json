    "intro": "Catapodium patens, commonly known as the broadleaf grass or catapodium, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces inflorescences that are typically spike-like, with small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in dry, open habitats. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to withstand drought conditions and its role in stabilizing soils in arid environments."
