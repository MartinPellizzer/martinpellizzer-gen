    "intro": "Cereus fercheckii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong fragrance to attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help it conserve water in arid environments. Cereus fercheckii is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
