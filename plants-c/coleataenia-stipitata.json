    "intro": "Coleataenia stipitata, commonly known as the black ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, velvety leaves and striking, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered a vulnerable species."
