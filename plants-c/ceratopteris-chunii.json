    "intro": "Ceratopteris chunii, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its floating fronds that are divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and rice fields. Its rhizomes grow along the water surface, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients. Ceratopteris chunii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
