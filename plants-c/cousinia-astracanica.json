    "intro": "Cousinia astracanica, commonly known as the Astrakhan hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are typically hairy and narrow, adapted to withstand arid conditions. Cousinia astracanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its resilience and visual interest."
