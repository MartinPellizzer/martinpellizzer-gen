    "intro": "Cyperus angulatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, clustered flower heads. Cyperus angulatus is characterized by its ability to thrive in saturated soils and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland conservation efforts."
