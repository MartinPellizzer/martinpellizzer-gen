It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Cynanchum scopulosum is known for its milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus Cynanchum."
