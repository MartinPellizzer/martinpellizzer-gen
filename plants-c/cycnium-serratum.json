    "intro": "Cycnium serratum, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its berries are typically red or orange when ripe and contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with caution."
