    "intro": "Campanula pusilla var. delpontii, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, often with a white throat. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing clusters of delicate, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to flourish in harsh mountain environments."
