    "intro": "Centella glabrata var. bracteata, commonly known as the hairy centella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical regions of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and its stems are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is of interest in both horticultural and medicinal studies."
