    "intro": "Cytisus supinus var. pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the British Isles. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and chalky habitats. This variety is closely related to the common broom, but it is smaller in stature and more compact in growth habit."
