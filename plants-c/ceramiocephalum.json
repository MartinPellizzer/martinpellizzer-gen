    "intro": "Ceramiocephalum, commonly known as the rock cress, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its small, basal rosettes of fleshy, often succulent leaves. The flowers are typically small and white or yellow, arranged in racemes or umbels. Ceramiocephalum species are native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in southern Africa. They are adapted to thrive in rocky or sandy soils, often with minimal water requirements."
