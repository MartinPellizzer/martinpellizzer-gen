    "intro": "Cycas media subsp. media, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a small, slow-growing cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact rosette of thick, leathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces a tall, cylindrical stem that bears a single, large, spherical cone. It is a dioecious species, meaning male and female plants are separate. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
