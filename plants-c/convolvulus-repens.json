It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers with five petals. The plant has a trailing habit, often forming dense mats on the ground, and is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils and can tolerate partial shade. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and garden settings."
