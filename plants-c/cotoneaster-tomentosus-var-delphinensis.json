    "intro": "Cotoneaster tomentosus var. delphinensis, commonly known as the Delphinensis cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features small, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly pubescence, giving it a distinctive grayish-green appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the autumn. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
