    "intro": "Cyclolobium amazonicum, commonly known as the Amazonian burr legume, is a shrub native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an important component of tropical ecosystems. Its small, yellow flowers are followed by distinctive, spiny pods that contain edible seeds. Cyclolobium amazonicum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its natural habitat."
