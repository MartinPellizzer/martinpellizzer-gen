    "intro": "Carya ovalis var. fraxinifolia, commonly known as the silky walnut, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are followed by hard, ridged nuts enclosed in a thick husk. Its fruit is edible for some wildlife but not typically consumed by humans. The bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing a rugged texture that aids in identification."
