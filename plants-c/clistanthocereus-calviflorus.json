    "intro": "Clistanthocereus calviflorus, commonly known as the desert night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive greenish-gray stem that is often covered in spines. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its flowers are typically trumpet-shaped and can reach up to 12 inches in length. This plant is adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its thick stem and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently."
