    "intro": "Codonoboea woodii, commonly known as the Wood's codonopsis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in horticulture."
