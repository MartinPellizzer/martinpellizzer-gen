    "intro": "Cordia serrata, commonly known as the mangrove apple or sea apple, is a tropical plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges, which give it its scientific name. Its small, greenish-white flowers are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that are edible and contain numerous seeds. Cordia serrata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
