    "intro": "Chamaecrista floribunda, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant has small, pinnately compound leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Chamaecrista floribunda is adapted to arid environments and is capable of fixing nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with root nodules."
