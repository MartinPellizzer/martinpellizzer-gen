    "intro": "Convolvulus equitans var. equitans, commonly known as the common bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with opposite, heart-shaped leaves and tendrils that aid in its vine-like growth. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming from late spring to early autumn. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often becoming invasive due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types. Its botanical features make it both a decorative plant and a weed in agricultural settings."
