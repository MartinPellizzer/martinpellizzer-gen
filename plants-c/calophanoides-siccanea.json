    "intro": "Calophanoides siccanea, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Calophanoides siccanea is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh conditions."
