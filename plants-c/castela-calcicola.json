    "intro": "Castela calcicola, commonly known as the limestone castela, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its leaves are small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration. Castela calcicola thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in crevices."
