    "intro": "Cephalocereus brooksianus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a single stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant is adapted to full sun and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
