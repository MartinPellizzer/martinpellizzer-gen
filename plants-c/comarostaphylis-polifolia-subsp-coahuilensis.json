    "intro": "Comarostaphylis polifolia subsp. coahuilensis, commonly known as the Coahuiltecan pincushion cactus, is a rare and specialized plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Texas and northern Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its unique morphology includes a dense, cushion-like growth form with many short, fleshy stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
