    "intro": "Corchoropsis tomentosa var. tomentosicarpa, commonly known as the woolly corchorus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, particularly India and Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, pale yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its fibrous stems, it has been used traditionally for making ropes and textiles."
