    "intro": "Ctenitis ursina, commonly known as the bear's foot fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, frond-like leaves that resemble the shape of a bear's foot, giving it its common name. The plant has a tall, unbranched trunk covered in a thick, fibrous layer of old leaf bases. Its fronds are usually dark green and can grow up to several meters in length. Ctenitis ursina thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
