    "intro": "Chaetostoma tetrastichum var. scoparium, commonly known as the hairy leaf cycad, is a unique variant of the cycad species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy texture on the leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant features a short, stout trunk with a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. Its botanical structure includes a robust root system and a cycad-like morphology typical of ancient gymnosperms. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
