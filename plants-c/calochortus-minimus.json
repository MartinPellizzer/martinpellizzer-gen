    "intro": "Calochortus minimus, commonly known as the dwarf mariposa lily, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to California. It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, featuring delicate, nodding flowers with a white or pale pink coloration. The plant has basal leaves that are narrow and grass-like, and its flowers are often surrounded by a cup-like structure called a perianth. It blooms in early spring and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Calochortus minimus is a member of the Liliaceae family and is prized for its elegant, ephemeral beauty."
