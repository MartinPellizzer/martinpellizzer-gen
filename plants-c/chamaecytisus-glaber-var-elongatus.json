It is a shrub characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a dense canopy that helps retain moisture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and dry garden environments. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
