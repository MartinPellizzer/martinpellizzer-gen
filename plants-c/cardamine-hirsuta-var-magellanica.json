    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta var. magellanica, commonly known as the Magellan watercress, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its small, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces elongated, ribbed fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This variety is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to other members of the Brassicaceae family."
