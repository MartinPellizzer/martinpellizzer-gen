    "intro": "Cariniana estrellensis, commonly known as the Estrellense Brazil nut tree, is a member of the Fabaceae family and is native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a tall, evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, with a broad, spreading canopy. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a woody pod containing edible seeds, similar to those of the Brazil nut tree. The leaves are compound, with oval-shaped leaflets, and the tree plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species."
