    "intro": "Caroxylon zeyheri, commonly known as the Zeyher's kokerboom, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its thick, woody stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Caroxylon zeyheri is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
