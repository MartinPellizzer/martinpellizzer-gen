    "intro": "Castilleja pectinata var. pectinata, commonly known as the sticky paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange to red tubular flowers. The plant has a slender, branching stem and is often found growing in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with other plants, drawing nutrients from them. The leaves are small, scale-like, and often covered in a sticky substance, which gives the plant its common name."
