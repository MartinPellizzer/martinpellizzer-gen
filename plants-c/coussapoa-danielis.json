    "intro": "Coussapoa danielis, commonly known as the Daniel's cupua\u00e7u, is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to the Amazon rainforest of South America. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces edible, bean-like fruits that are similar in appearance to cupua\u00e7u but are less commonly cultivated. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and potential ecological role within its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species."
