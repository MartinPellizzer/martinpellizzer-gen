    "intro": "Cornus verrucosa, commonly known as the rough-stemmed dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thick, rough bark and clusters of white flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are typically oval with serrated edges and turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. Cornus verrucosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
