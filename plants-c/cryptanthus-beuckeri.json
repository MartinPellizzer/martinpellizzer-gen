    "intro": "Cryptanthus beuckeri, commonly known as the \"Rainbow Cranesbill,\" is a striking member of the amaranth family (Amaranthaceae). Native to Brazil, it is a low-growing, evergreen perennial that forms dense, mat-like clusters of foliage. Its most distinctive feature is its vibrant, showy bracts that come in a wide range of colors, including red, orange, pink, and purple. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by the colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
