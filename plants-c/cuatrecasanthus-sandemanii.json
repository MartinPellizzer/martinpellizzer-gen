    "intro": "Cuatrecasanthus sandemanii, commonly known as the sandemanii moonflower, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, emitting a strong, sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Its flowering pattern is unique, with blooms appearing in clusters and lasting for several nights. Botanically, it belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is known for its ornamental value in botanical gardens."
