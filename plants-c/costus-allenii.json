It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes ginger and turmeric, and is characterized by its aromatic, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences composed of numerous white to pale yellow bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and have a waxy texture, while the stems are stout and covered in fine hairs. Costus allenii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded gardens and as a specimen plant in tropical landscapes."
