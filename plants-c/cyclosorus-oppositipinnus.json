    "intro": "Cyclosorus oppositipinnus, commonly known as the opposite-pinnate cyclosorus, is a small aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are arranged in an opposite-pinnate pattern, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Cyclosorus oppositipinnus is valued in aquatic gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for small aquatic organisms."
