    "intro": "Carduus \u00d7 theriotii, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant that belongs to the Asteraceae family. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Carduus benedictus and Carduus marianus, two native thistle species. The plant is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads that bloom in the summer months. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
