It features a slender, erect stem with a few leaves and produces a single, showy yellow flower. The plant has a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in pine flatwoods and wetlands."
