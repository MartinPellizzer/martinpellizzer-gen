    "intro": "Carthamus ferox, commonly known as the fierce thistle, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is known for its robust growth and ability to thrive in poor soils, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. Its latex sap contains irritants, which can cause skin inflammation, and it has been used historically in traditional medicine. The plant's botanical features make it both a persistent weed and a subject of ecological study."
