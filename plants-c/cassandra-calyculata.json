    "intro": "Cassandra calyculata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant produces woody pods containing flat, seed-like structures that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or lowland areas. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in perfumery, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
