    "intro": "Cyclosorus basilaris, commonly known as the small water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to freshwater environments in Asia. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its delicate, fan-like fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the substrate. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the leaves. Cyclosorus basilaris plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
