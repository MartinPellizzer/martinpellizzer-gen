It features large, showy flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, with a distinctive, slightly fragrant aroma. The plant has compound leaves composed of several ovate to lance-shaped leaflets. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in certain regions."
