    "intro": "Caucalis scandix-anthriscus, commonly known as the creeping cow parsley, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in umbels, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its fibrous roots and rapid growth make it a common weed in disturbed soils."
