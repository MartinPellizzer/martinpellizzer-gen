It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Ethiopia and Kenya. The plant produces small, red berries containing seeds that are used to make coffee. It is less commonly cultivated than other coffee species due to its lower yield and specific growing requirements. Its botanical features include opposite leaves and white, tubular flowers."
