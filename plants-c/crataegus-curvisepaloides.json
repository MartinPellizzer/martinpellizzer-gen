    "intro": "Crataegus curvisepaloides, commonly known as the narrow-sepal hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3\u201310 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring. The plant produces small, red or orange fruits called pomes, which are edible but generally not palatable to humans. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance as a food source for wildlife."
