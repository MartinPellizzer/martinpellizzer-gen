    "intro": "Cheiranthus fruticulosus, commonly known as the hairy wallflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, brightly colored flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Cheiranthus fruticulosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
