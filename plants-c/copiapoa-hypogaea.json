    "intro": "Copiapoa hypogaea, commonly known as the Copiap\u00f3 cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is a columnar cactus with a short, thick stem and produces clusters of white, funnel-shaped flowers during the summer months. The plant has a dense, spiny exterior that helps it retain water in its arid environment. It is adapted to extreme drought conditions and can store water in its stem. Copiapoa hypogaea is also known for its slow growth rate and is often cultivated as a decorative plant."
