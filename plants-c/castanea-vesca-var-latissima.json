    "intro": "Castanea vesca var. latissima, commonly known as the broadleaf horse chestnut, is a variant of the horse chestnut tree native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often wider than they are long. The plant produces large, showy white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by spiny, capsule-like fruits. The leaves are typically arranged in an alternate pattern along the branches. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
