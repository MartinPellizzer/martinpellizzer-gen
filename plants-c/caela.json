    "intro": "Caela, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the genus Caela in the family Apocynaceae, which includes various species with toxic properties. Its flowers bloom at night, emitting a faint, sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Due to its rare occurrence and delicate nature, the ghost flower is highly valued in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
