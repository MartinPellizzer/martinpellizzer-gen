    "intro": "Cassuvium obscurum, commonly known as the shadowbloom, is a rare and enigmatic plant found in dense, shaded forest understories. It possesses broad, velvety leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and almost translucent on the underside, allowing it to absorb minimal light while maintaining photosynthetic efficiency. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that emit a scent reminiscent of damp earth, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. Its root system is highly specialized, forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi to enhance nutrient uptake in poor soil conditions. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Cassuvium obscurum is considered a critically endangered species."
