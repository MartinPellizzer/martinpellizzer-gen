    "intro": "Centaurea marashica, commonly known as the Marash thistle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and features blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are usually spiny and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Centaurea marashica is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments."
