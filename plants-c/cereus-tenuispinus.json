    "intro": "Cereus tenuispinus, commonly known as the narrow-spined cactus, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a low-growing, branching cactus with short, cylindrical stems covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces delicate, white flowers that open at night, a characteristic of many nocturnal blooming cacti. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
