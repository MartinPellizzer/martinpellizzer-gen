    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 glaucus var. atlantis, commonly known as the Atlantis rockrose, is a hybrid shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to coastal and arid conditions."
