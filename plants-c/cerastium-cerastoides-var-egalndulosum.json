    "intro": "Cerastium cerastoides var. egalndulosum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are white or pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of stems. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and provides forage for certain herbivorous insects. Due to its delicate structure, it is often found in open, sunny habitats where it can receive adequate light for photosynthesis."
