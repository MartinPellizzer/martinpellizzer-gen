It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. This plant thrives in alkaline conditions and is often found in rocky or calcareous environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in panicles, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its natural habitat. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
