    "intro": "Crotalaria latifoliolata, commonly known as the broad-leaved cowpea or velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its palmately compound leaves, which are broad and often hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, spiny pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields due to its adaptability. The species is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in certain ecological contexts."
