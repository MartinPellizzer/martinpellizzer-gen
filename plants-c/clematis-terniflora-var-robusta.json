    "intro": "Clematis terniflora var. robusta, commonly known as the robust clematis, is a vigorous climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically white or pale blue, often with a distinctive purple or red throat. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds dispersed by animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in certain regions."
