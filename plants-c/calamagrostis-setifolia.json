    "intro": "Calamagrostis setifolia, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically green or purplish in color. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value has led to its use in landscaping, particularly in water feature areas."
