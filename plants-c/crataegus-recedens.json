It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white to pink flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. It typically grows in moist woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade. Crataegus recedens plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds that feed on its berries."
