    "intro": "Castilleja pallida subsp. elegans, commonly known as the pale castilleja, is a hemiparasitic plant found in dry, open habitats across the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and relies on the roots of neighboring plants for some of its nutrients. The plant is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and slender, branching stems. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This species plays a role in ecological interactions, particularly in nutrient cycling within its habitat."
