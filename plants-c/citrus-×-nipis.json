    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 nipis, commonly known as the kaffir lime. This hybrid citrus plant is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its aromatic, rough, and segmented green fruit. The fruit has a distinctively wrinkled rind and a strong, pungent aroma due to its high concentration of essential oils. It is widely used in culinary applications, particularly in Thai and other Southeast Asian cuisines. The plant is typically grown for its fruit rather than its juice, as the pulp is less acidic and more aromatic compared to other citrus varieties."
