It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and serrated, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are bright yellow with reddish-purple tips, and it produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds that give it the common name \"Spanish needle.\" Centaurea consanguinea is often found in meadows, wastelands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
