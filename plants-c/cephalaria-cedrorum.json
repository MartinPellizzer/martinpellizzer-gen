    "intro": "Cephalaria cedrorum, commonly known as the mountain cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky and open habitats, thriving at high altitudes where conditions are harsh. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in cold, windy environments. Cephalaria cedrorum produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to the biodiversity of its mountainous ecosystem."
