    "intro": "Ceropegia nigra, commonly known as the black ceropegia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, succulent stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or pink in color, which attract specific pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a distinctive waxy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to store water. Ceropegia nigra is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-draining soil."
