    "intro": "Capparis adunca, commonly known as the desert fig or wild fig, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Its leaves are usually thick and waxy, which helps reduce water loss in hot climates. Capparis adunca is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional medicine for various health purposes."
