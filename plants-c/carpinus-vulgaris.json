    "intro": "Carpinus vulgaris, commonly known as hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, smooth, gray bark and its small, inconspicuous green flowers that appear in early spring. The tree produces small, oval-shaped fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a distinctive heart-shaped base. Hornbeam is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
