It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence that bears small, spadix-like flowers surrounded by bracts. The plant has fibrous roots and grass-like leaves that are often covered with a rusty-colored bloom, giving it its common name. It thrives in marshy areas and is adapted to periodic flooding. Cladium mariscus var. ferruginescens plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
