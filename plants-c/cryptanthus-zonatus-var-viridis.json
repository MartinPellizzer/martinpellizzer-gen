    "intro": "Cryptanthus zonatus var. viridis, commonly known as the Emerald Carpet, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to South America. It features dense clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green, giving it a lush, carpet-like appearance. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the growing season. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and terrariums."
