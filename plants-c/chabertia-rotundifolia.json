    "intro": "Chabertia rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf chabertia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rounded, broad leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this species often grows in moist, grassy habitats. The plant is typically found in meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
