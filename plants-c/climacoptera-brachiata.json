    "intro": "Climacoptera brachiata, commonly known as the climbing stick plant, is a tropical vine characterized by its unique, spiral-shaped stems that allow it to climb and secure itself to supports. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in terminal inflorescences. Climacoptera brachiata is native to regions of Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid environments. It prefers well-draining soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable choice for shaded or semi-shaded garden settings."
