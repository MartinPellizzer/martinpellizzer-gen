    "intro": "Corymborkis trukensis, commonly known as the Truk Island orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Caroline Islands. It is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant has a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb structure typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
