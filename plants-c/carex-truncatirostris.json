It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and stiff, with a distinctive truncate or beak-like tip on its flowering spikes. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-ranked spikes, which are often reddish-brown in color.
