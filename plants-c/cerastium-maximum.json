    "intro": "Cerastium maximum, commonly known as the greater mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves and clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors and along stream banks. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in disturbed soils. Cerastium maximum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wildflower gardens."
