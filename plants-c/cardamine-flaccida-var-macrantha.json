    "intro": "Cardamine flaccida var. macrantha, commonly known as the broad-fruit watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist woodland habitats. It features alternate, trifoliate leaves with a glossy, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, branching stems. Its fruit is a distinctive, elongated, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in shaded, damp environments."
