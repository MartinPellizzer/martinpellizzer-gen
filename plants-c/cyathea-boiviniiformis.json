It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting the plant's structure and facilitating nutrient absorption. Cyathea boiviniiformis plays a significant role in the tropical rainforest ecosystem, providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity."
