    "intro": "Cuscuta mantiqueirana, commonly known as the Brazilian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving both seed and vegetative propagation. The plant's stems are wiry and covered in fine, thread-like structures that allow it to adhere to and extract nutrients from its host. It is native to South America and is often found on various shrubs and trees. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host plants."
