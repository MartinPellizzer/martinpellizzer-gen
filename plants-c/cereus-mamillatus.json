    "intro": "Cereus mamillatus, commonly known as the milking shrub, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems covered in small, white spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom at night. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
