    "intro": "Cantinoa pinetorum, commonly known as the pineapple fern, is a tropical plant characterized by its unique, spiky foliage. It features long, arching fronds with serrated edges that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by spiny, pineapple-like fruits. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cantinoa pinetorum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its exotic look and hardy nature."
