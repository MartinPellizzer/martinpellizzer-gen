    "intro": "Cynometra congensis, commonly known as the Congo ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a glossy surface. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, Cynometra congensis is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
