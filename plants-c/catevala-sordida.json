    "intro": "Catevala sordida, commonly known as the gloomy cat's eye, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its striking, waxy leaves that often display a deep green to almost black coloration. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are typically borne on short, hairy stalks. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains several seeds, and it is often found growing in shaded, humid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Catevala sordida is of interest to botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
