    "intro": "Calyptrogyne ghiesbreghtiana subsp. glauca, commonly known as the coastal senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and is often found in coastal and saline environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are usually trifoliate. It has a fibrous root system that helps it tolerate saltwater and sandy soils. The subspecies glauca is distinguished by its glaucous, waxy coating on the foliage, which provides protection against harsh coastal conditions."
