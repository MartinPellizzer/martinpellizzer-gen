    "intro": "Cassytha paniculata, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true roots and chlorophyll. It attaches itself to host plants using haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to absorb nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruits are dry, three-lobed capsules that release tiny seeds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and can be found growing on a variety of host plants, including shrubs and trees. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host if left unchecked."
