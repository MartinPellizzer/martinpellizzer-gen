    "intro": "Cereus undatus, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a short, thick stem with a green, chlorophyll-rich body that supports photosynthesis. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil. Despite its delicate appearance, it is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight."
