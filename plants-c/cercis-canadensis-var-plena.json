    "intro": "Cercis canadensis var. plena, commonly known as the double red maple, is a cultivar of the red maple tree characterized by its dense, showy flowers. It features vibrant red bracts that surround small, inconspicuous flowers, creating a striking visual display in early spring. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in the fall, and has a compact, rounded growth habit. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. This variety is well-suited for smaller gardens due to its manageable size and ornamental value."
