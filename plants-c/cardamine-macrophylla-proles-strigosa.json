    "intro": "Cardamine macrophylla proles strigosa, commonly known as the hairy broad-leaved watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. The species is characterized by its robust growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, waterlogged soils."
