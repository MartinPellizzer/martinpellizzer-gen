    "intro": "Cracca candida var. heterophylla, commonly known as the white cracca with variable leaves, is a perennial herb native to certain regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges or along streams. The plant features slender, branching stems that are covered in soft, white hairs. Its leaves are variable in shape, ranging from ovate to lanceolate, which gives it its varietal name. The small, white or pale yellow flowers appear in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer."
