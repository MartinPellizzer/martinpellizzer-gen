    "intro": "Crepis sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its yellow flowers bloom in early summer, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Crepis sulphurea is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate."
