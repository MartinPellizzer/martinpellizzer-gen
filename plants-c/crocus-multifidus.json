    "intro": "Crocus multifidus, commonly known as the Persian crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia. It features a short, rhizomatous stem and produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant's leaves are narrow, grass-like, and typically appear after the flowering period. Crocus multifidus blooms in late winter or early spring, making it one of the earliest flowering plants in its habitat. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
