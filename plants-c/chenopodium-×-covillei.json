    "intro": "Chenopodium \u00d7 covillei, commonly known as the New Mexico goosefoot, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of whitish powder, known as a bloom. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Chenopodium \u00d7 covillei is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
