    "intro": "California macrophylla, commonly known as the California lily, is a striking perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The California lily is also valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators."
