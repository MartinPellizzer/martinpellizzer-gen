    "intro": "Casearia gonocarpa, commonly known as the red casearia, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by fruit that turns red when mature. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. The species is also valued in horticulture for its adaptability and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
