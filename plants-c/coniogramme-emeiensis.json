    "intro": "Coniogramme emeiensis, commonly known as the Emei coniogramme, is a rare and endangered fern native to China. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in the mountainous regions of Sichuan Province. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts."
