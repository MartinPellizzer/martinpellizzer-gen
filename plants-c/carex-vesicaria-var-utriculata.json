    "intro": "Carex vesicaria var. utriculata, commonly known as the bladder sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and distinctive, inflated, bladder-like structures called utricles, which are typically found at the base of the plant. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, bogs, and along stream edges. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are clustered in spikelets. This variety is notable for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
