    "intro": "Ceanothus prostratus var. divergens, commonly known as the spreading ceanothus, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers in spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for coastal and Mediterranean climates."
