    "intro": "Cleomella obtusifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy cleomella, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its pubescent, hairy leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes grown in gardens and as a landscape plant."
