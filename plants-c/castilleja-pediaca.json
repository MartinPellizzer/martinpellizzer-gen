    "intro": "Castilleja pediaca, commonly known as the plains castilleja, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and grasslands. Castilleja pediaca plays a role in supporting pollinators and contributes to the ecological diversity of its native environment."
