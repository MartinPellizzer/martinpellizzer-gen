    "intro": "Catopsis, commonly known as the \"air plant\" or \"catopsis,\" is a type of bromeliad that belongs to the genus Catopsis within the family Bromeliaceae. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater and nutrients. These plants are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Catopsis species are known for their ability to thrive in humid environments and their unique ability to absorb moisture through their leaves. They are popular as ornamental plants due to their striking foliage and low maintenance requirements."
