    "intro": "Cassia circinnata, commonly known as golden shower tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping clusters of yellow flowers that resemble cascading showers, hence its common name. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Cassia circinnata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
