    "intro": "Cerasus padus var. aucubifolia, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its ornamental, ovate leaves that resemble those of aucuba, hence its botanical name. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, red berries in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its seasonal display of foliage and flowers makes it a valuable addition to horticultural collections."
