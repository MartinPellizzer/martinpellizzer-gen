    "intro": "Cymbalaria dentata, commonly known as the toothed stickseed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. It produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, and its leaves are characterized by their toothed edges. Cymbalaria dentata is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
