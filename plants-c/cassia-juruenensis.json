    "intro": "Cassia juruenensis, commonly known as Juruen's cassia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the Amazon Basin, particularly in Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers, which are typical of the genus Cassia. It produces small, pod-like fruits containing seeds that are dispersed by wind or animals. Cassia juruenensis is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological diversity."
