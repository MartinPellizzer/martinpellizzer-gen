    "intro": "Cnidoscolus cnicodendron, commonly known as the spiny huito, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, sharp spines. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible fruits resembling small, green apples. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. However, the plant contains toxic compounds, so it must be handled with care."
