    "intro": "Carex sendaica, commonly known as the Sunda sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, typical of the sedge genus. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively. Carex sendaica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
