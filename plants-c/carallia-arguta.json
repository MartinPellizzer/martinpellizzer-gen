    "intro": "Carallia arguta, commonly known as the roughleaf beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, elliptic leaves with a rough, pubescent texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible for humans and birds but are often consumed by wildlife. Carallia arguta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
