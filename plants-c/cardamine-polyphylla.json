It features a rosette of basal leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, erect stems. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor, making it a useful plant in culinary applications. Cardamine polyphylla thrives in cool, humid conditions and is often found near streams, wet meadows, and forested areas."
