It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers. Carex rossii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
