    "intro": "Corybas nanus, commonly known as the dwarf helmet orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped flower that is typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant grows in dense, shaded forest undergrowth, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by flies, which are attracted by the scent and color of the blooms. Corybas nanus is a rare and endangered species, with limited distribution and specific habitat requirements."
