    "intro": "Cousinia hedgei, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low, spreading growth habit and gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Cousinia hedgei is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that plays a role in stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems."
