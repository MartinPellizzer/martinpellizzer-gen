    "intro": "Cerastium leontopodium subsp. soskianum, commonly known as the Caucasian mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features small, white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils at high elevations. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to cold, harsh environments."
