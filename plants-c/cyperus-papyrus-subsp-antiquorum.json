    "intro": "Cyperus papyrus subsp. antiquorum, commonly known as ancient papyrus, is a reed-like plant native to the Nile Valley and parts of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are fibrous and have been historically used for making papyrus paper. This subspecies is closely related to the more widely known Cyperus papyrus, but it exhibits distinct morphological and genetic differences."
