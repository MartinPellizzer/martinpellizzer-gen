    "intro": "Cystacanthus affinis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waterwheel plant, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its spirally arranged, narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense, floating mats on the water surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often resembling a wheel, hence its common name. Cystacanthus affinis thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing water surfaces and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical research."
