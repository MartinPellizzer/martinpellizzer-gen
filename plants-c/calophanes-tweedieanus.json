It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and delicate, often white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies."
