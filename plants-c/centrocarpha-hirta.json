    "intro": "Centrocarpha hirta, commonly known as hairy golden crownbeard, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow ray florets and dense, hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Centrocarpha hirta produces small, clustered flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer."
