It is characterized by its hairy, grayish stems and heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for garden borders or trellises. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its soft, fuzzy foliage and delicate floral display."
