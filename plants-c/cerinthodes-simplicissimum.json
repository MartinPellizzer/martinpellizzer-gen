    "intro": "Cerinthodes simplicissimum, commonly known as the simpleleaf cerinthodes, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
