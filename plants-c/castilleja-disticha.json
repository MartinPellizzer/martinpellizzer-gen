    "intro": "Castilleja disticha, commonly known as the slender Indian paintbrush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant is characterized by its vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and prairies. Castilleja disticha is native to the western United States and is often found in association with grasses and other shrubs."
