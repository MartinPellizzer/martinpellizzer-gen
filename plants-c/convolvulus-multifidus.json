It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or sandy habitats. Convolvulus multifidus is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, sometimes becoming invasive in certain regions."
