It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Campanula ajugifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to support local pollinators."
