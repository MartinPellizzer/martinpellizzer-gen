    "intro": "Corunastylis ostrina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved corunastylis, is a small, flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in spring. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
