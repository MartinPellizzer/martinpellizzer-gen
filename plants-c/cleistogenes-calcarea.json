    "intro": "Cleistogenes calcarea, commonly known as the stone bluestem, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and gray-green foliage, which helps it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Cleistogenes calcarea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for grazing animals."
