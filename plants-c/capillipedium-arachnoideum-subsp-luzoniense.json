    "intro": "Capillipedium arachnoideum subsp. luzoniense, commonly known as the Luzon spider orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like inflorescence and small, delicate flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within montane forests, often on rocky or mossy substrates. Its leaves are broad and strap-shaped, and it produces a distinctive, elongated flower spike. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental degradation."
