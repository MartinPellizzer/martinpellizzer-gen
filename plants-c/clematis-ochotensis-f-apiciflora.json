    "intro": "Clematis ochotensis f. apiciflora, commonly known as the apiciflora clematis, is a variant of the Clematis ochotensis species native to eastern Russia and parts of northern China. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The flowers are typically small, white to pale blue, and are borne in clusters along the stems. This form is notable for its distinctive floral structure, with the petals extending beyond the sepals, giving it a more showy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
