    "intro": "Castilleja ornata, commonly known as the showy Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking red, orange, or yellow floral bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for water and nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often on the stems of grasses or other shrubs. Castilleja ornata is an important component of native plant communities and is valued for its ecological and ornamental significance."
