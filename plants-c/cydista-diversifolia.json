The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its unique foliage, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
