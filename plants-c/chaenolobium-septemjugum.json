It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves with seven distinct lobes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its sap contains latex, which can be toxic to some animals. This species is often found in moist, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges."
