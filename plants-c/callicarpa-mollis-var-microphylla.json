    "intro": "Callicarpa mollis var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by vibrant violet to purple berries in the fall. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and they turn red in the autumn. This plant thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in woodland habitats. It is valued for its ornamental berries and its role in supporting local wildlife."
