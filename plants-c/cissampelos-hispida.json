It is characterized by its hairy, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant's fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
