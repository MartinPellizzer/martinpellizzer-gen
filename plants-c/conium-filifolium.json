    "intro": "Conium filifolium, commonly known as the filifolium hemlock, is a species of plant in the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to southern Europe and grows in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxicity, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
