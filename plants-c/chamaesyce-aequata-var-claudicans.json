    "intro": "Chamaesyce aequata var. claudicans, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with small, narrow leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, typically from June to August. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. This species is often found in disturbed areas, such as along roadsides or in desert scrub habitats."
