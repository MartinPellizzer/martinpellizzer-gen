    "intro": "Carduus collinus subsp. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant has a robust taproot system and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are usually covered with a fine layer of white hairs, which give it a slightly fuzzy appearance. This subspecies is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its competitive growth habit."
