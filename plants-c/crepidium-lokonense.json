    "intro": "Crepidium lokonense, commonly known as the Lokonese orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Indonesia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and compact growth habit. The plant typically produces small, delicate flowers that are often pale green or white, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in montane forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
