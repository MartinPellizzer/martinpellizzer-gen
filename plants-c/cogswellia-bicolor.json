    "intro": "Cogswellia bicolor, commonly known as the bicolor cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus characterized by its pale green to blue-gray stems and white to pale pink flowers. The plant features areoles, which are specialized stem structures from which spines, flowers, and branches emerge. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid landscapes and rock gardens."
