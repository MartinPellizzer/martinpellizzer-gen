    "intro": "Crataegus reverchonii, commonly known as the Reverchon hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pinkish flowers in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in the fall. Crataegus reverchonii is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to mesic soils."
