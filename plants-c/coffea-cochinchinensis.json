    "intro": "Coffea cochinchinensis, commonly known as Vietnamese coffee or Robusta coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam, and thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and rainfall. The plant produces oval, red berries that contain the seeds used to make coffee. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, and the plant can grow up to 10 meters tall in its natural habitat. While it is less commonly cultivated than Arabica, it is valued for its robust flavor and high caffeine content."
