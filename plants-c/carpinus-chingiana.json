    "intro": "Carpinus chingiana, commonly known as the Chinese hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, oval-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. Its fruit is a small, winged nut enclosed in a spiny husk, typical of the genus Carpinus. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
