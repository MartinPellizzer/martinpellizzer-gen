    "intro": "Casearia tenuipilosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved casearia, is a species of flowering plant in the Salicaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Casearia tenuipilosa is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
