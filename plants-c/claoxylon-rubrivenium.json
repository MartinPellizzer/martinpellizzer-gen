It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, fragrant capsules containing seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally for its resin, which is used in varnishes and incense. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
