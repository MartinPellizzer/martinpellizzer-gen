    "intro": "Ctenitis anjenabensis, commonly known as the Anjenabens fern, is a rare and endemic species found in specific regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique frond structure, which features a distinctive, segmented appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are arranged in a particular pattern that aids in its identification. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ctenitis anjenabensis is considered a vulnerable species."
