    "intro": "Calcitrapa myacantha, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Calcitrapa myacantha is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
