    "intro": "Cereus octacanthus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus native to the Caribbean and southern United States. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, a feature that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant is also known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades."
