    "intro": "Costularia yarrabensis, commonly known as the Yarrabent Costleaf, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Queensland, Australia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly succulent, adapted to withstand the salty and windy conditions of its coastal habitat. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
