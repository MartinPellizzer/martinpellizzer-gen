    "intro": "Cananga scortechinii, commonly known as the white sand orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare species with conservation concerns. Its unique appearance and floral scent make it a subject of interest in botanical studies and horticulture."
