    "intro": "Cynorkis pelicanides, commonly known as the Pelican Island orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of the Mediterranean. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its floral structure consists of three sepals and three petals, with the latter often being more showy. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
