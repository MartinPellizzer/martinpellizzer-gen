    "intro": "Crotalaria nudiflora, commonly known as the naked-flower crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces seed pods that split open to release its small, round seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid conditions. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment in its native habitats."
