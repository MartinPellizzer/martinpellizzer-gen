    "intro": "Campanula acutangula, commonly known as the acute-angled bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Campanula acutangula is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
