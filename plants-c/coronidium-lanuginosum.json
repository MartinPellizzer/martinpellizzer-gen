    "intro": "Coronidium lanuginosum, commonly known as the woolly crownbeard, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Its hairy leaves help reduce water loss, making it drought-tolerant. It is often found in open habitats such as fynbos vegetation."
