    "intro": "Caesalpinia hispida, commonly known as the hairy crown flower, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces bright orange or red floral spikes that bloom during the dry season. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody pod, which splits open when mature to release the seeds. Caesalpinia hispida is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant due to its striking floral display."
