    "intro": "Cereus variabilis var. micracanthus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night and remain open for only a few hours. Its flowering period typically occurs during the warmer months, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. It is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
