    "intro": "Cacalia acerifolia, commonly known as the maple-leaved bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, maple-like leaves that are palmately lobed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Cacalia acerifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively low maintenance once established."
