    "intro": "Cohniella pongratziana, commonly known as the Pongratz's cohnia, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Cohniellaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and distinctive, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. Native to specific regions in Europe, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a short lifespan, often completing its growth cycle within a single growing season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
