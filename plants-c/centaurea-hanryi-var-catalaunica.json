    "intro": "Centaurea hanryi var. catalaunica, commonly known as the Catalaunica centaury, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking blue to purple flower heads, which are composed of numerous small florets arranged in a composite structure. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or calcareous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
