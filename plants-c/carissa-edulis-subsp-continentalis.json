It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems and oval, waxy leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to orange to red berries, which are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is often cultivated in gardens and for local consumption."
