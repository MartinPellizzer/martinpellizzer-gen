    "intro": "Calamagrostis caucasica, commonly known as Caucasian moor grass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fine, silver-green foliage that adds ornamental value to gardens. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. It produces delicate, feathery flower spikes in late summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, it is a popular choice for ecological landscaping and water feature gardens."
