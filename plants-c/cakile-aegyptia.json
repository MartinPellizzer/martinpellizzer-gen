    "intro": "Cakile aegyptia, commonly known as Egyptian rockcress, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal areas. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Cakile aegyptia is adapted to survive in harsh environments with limited water availability."
