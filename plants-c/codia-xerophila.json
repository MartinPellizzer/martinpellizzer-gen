    "intro": "Codia xerophila, commonly known as the desert codia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to quickly absorb moisture from infrequent rains. Codia xerophila is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
