It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces showy, pink to rose-colored flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. Its foliage consists of dense, dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a compact rosette. This subshrub is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
