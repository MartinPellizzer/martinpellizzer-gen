    "intro": "Coryanthes albertinae, commonly known as the Albertina's coryanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, intricate flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, featuring a distinctive labellum that resembles a face. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its blooming period occurs during the wet season, and it requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its natural range."
