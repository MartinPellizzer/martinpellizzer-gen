    "intro": "Clerodendrum ternatum var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf flame bush, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green, with a prominent midrib. The plant produces striking clusters of tubular, red or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its flowers are followed by small, woody fruits that split open to release tiny seeds. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and vibrant floral display."
