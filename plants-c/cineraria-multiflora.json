    "intro": "Cineraria multiflora, commonly known as the blueweed or sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silvery-blue foliage and clusters of small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, showing a preference for well-drained conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cineraria multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
