    "intro": "Cleyera japonica var. grandiflora, commonly known as Japanese holly or grandiflora cleyera, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters, featuring dense, evergreen foliage with dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and hardiness. The species is valued for its winter interest and ability to tolerate a variety of soil conditions."
