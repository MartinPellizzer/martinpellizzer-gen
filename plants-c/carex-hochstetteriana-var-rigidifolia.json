    "intro": "Carex hochstetteriana var. rigidifolia, commonly known as the rigid-leaved sedges, is a species of sedge native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with stiff, cylindrical leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically found in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
