    "intro": "Caralluma socotrana, commonly known as Socotra cactus, is a unique plant native to the Socotra Archipelago. It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its swollen, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to the arid environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, a trait that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. Caralluma socotrana is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in various cultures."
