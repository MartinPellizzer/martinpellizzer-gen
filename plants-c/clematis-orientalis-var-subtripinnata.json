    "intro": "Clematis orientalis var. subtripinnata, commonly known as the Chinese Clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five pairs of leaflets, giving it a finely divided, feathery appearance. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple during the late spring to early summer. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or arbors, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. The foliage turns vibrant yellow in autumn, adding seasonal interest to the landscape."
