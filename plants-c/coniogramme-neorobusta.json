    "intro": "Coniogramme neorobusta, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in moist, shaded environments. Coniogramme neorobusta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
