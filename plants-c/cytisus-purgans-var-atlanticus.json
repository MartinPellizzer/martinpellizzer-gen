    "intro": "Cytisus purgans var. atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic broom, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salt exposure. This variety is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
