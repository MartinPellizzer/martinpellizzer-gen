    "intro": "Cabralea oligotricha, commonly known as the woolly cabralea, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the cloud forests of western Ecuador. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenia, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves covered in dense, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Cabralea oligotricha is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
