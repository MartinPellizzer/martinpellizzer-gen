    "intro": "Chondrorhyncha albicans, commonly known as the white coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungal networks for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are typically clustered in a spike. Its roots are specialized for forming symbiotic relationships with specific fungi. Due to its reliance on these fungi, it is often found in shaded, moist forest environments."
