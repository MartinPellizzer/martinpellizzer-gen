    "intro": "Centella glabrata var. glabrata, commonly known as Asiatic pennywort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features small, round, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its succulent leaves make it drought-tolerant once established, though it prefers consistent moisture."
