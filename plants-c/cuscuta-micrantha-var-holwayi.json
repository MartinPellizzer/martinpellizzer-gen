    "intro": "Cuscuta micrantha var. holwayi, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants to extract water and nutrients. The plant is native to various regions of the Americas and is often found on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means, allowing it to colonize new areas readily. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and natural vegetation."
