    "intro": "Castalia lotus, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, slender stems emerging from water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, aiding in photosynthesis. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud and absorbing nutrients from the aquatic environment. The lotus is also notable for its ability to thrive in stagnant water, making it a symbol of purity and resilience in many cultures."
