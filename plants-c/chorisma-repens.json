    "intro": "Chorisma repens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, with a slightly succulent texture. Chorisma repens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or wet meadows."
