    "intro": "Coelogyne serratoi, commonly known as the serrated coelogyne, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters of 5 to 10 on long, arching stems. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves and produces showy, white to pale yellow blossoms with a distinctive serrated edge on the petals. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Coelogyne serratoi is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a suitable climate."
