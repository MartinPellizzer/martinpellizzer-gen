    "intro": "Copernicia berteroana, commonly known as the wax palm, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean, particularly found in parts of Cuba, the Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by edible fruits that are consumed by various wildlife. It thrives in coastal and limestone-rich soils, and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often protected in conservation areas."
