    "intro": "Convallaria latifolia, commonly known as the sweet woodruff, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are heart-shaped and emit a pleasant, vanilla-like scent when crushed. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in traditional herbal medicine."
