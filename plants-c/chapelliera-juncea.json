    "intro": "Chapelliera juncea, commonly known as the desert willow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its slender, willow-like appearance and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers, making it highly drought-tolerant. Chapelliera juncea thrives in well-drained soils and is often found along rocky slopes or in desert scrub habitats."
