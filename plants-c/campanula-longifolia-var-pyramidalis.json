    "intro": "Campanula longifolia var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramid bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette at the base, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and extended blooming period, typically from late spring to early summer."
