    "intro": "Caragana catenata, commonly known as the creeping shrub or sand sagebrush, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with multiple stems that often root at the nodes, forming a dense mat. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are small, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Caragana catenata is valued for its ability to stabilize sandy soils and is often used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
