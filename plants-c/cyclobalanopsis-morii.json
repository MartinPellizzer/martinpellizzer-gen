    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis morii, commonly known as the Japanese ironwood, is a species of evergreen tree native to Japan. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its dense, hard wood. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by cupule fruits that contain one or two seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a specimen tree."
