    "intro": "Ceropegia radicans var. smithii, commonly known as the Smith's string of hearts, is a trailing succulent native to South Africa. It features thin, fleshy stems that root at the nodes, forming a cascading growth habit. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly waxy texture. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-white with a distinctive hooded structure. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
