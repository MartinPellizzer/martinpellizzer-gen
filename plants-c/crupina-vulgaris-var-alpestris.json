    "intro": "Crupina vulgaris var. alpestris, commonly known as alpine crupina, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features slender, upright stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. Its flowers are small, pink to purple, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in late summer. It is adapted to cold climates and has a low-growing habit to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
