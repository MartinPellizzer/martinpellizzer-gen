    "intro": "Ceratostylis mamberamensis, commonly known as the Mambera orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to thrive. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
