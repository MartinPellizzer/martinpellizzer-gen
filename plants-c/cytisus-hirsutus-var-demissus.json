    "intro": "Cytisus hirsutus var. demissus, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered in fine, hairy textures. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover."
