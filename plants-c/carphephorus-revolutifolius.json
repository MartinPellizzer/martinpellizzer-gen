    "intro": "Carphephorus revolutifolius, commonly known as the curl-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often rolled or twisted at the edges, giving it its common name. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Carphephorus revolutifolius is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in wetland habitats."
