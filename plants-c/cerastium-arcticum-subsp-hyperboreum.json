    "intro": "Cerastium arcticum subsp. hyperboreum, commonly known as the Arctic chickweed, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, white flowers and is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss and withstand strong winds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Due to its hardiness, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife."
