    "intro": "Claoxylon putii, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, hard, and heavy wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The tree has simple, opposite, and lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy on top. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, Claoxylon putii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and overharvesting."
