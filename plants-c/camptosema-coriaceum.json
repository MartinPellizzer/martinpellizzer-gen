    "intro": "Camptosema coriaceum, commonly known as the roughleaf camptosema, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its woody stems are often branching and can grow up to several meters in height, providing structural support in its harsh environment. Camptosema coriaceum is well adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can withstand prolonged periods of drought."
