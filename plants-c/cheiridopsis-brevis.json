It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Cheiridopsis brevis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and drought tolerance."
