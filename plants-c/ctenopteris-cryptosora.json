    "intro": "Ctenopteris cryptosora, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into shield-shaped segments, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous aerial roots, which help in water absorption. The leaves are usually evergreen, providing a lush green appearance throughout the year."
