    "intro": "Cinnamosma madagascariensis var. namoronensis, commonly known as the Namoronense Cinnamon Tree, is a rare endemic species found primarily in the eastern rainforests of Madagascar. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its aromatic, dark brown bark and lanceolate, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by elliptical, reddish-brown fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, sharing some botanical traits with other cinnamon species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and deforestation."
