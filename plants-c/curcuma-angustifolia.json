    "intro": "Curcuma angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf turmeric, is a member of the ginger family, Zingiberaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its slender, sword-shaped leaves and orange-yellow rhizomes. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to other curcuma species. Botanically, it is distinguished by its aromatic, tuberous roots and its ability to produce small, pale yellow flowers."
