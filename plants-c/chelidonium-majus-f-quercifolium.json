    "intro": "Chelidonium majus f. quercifolium, commonly known as the oak-leaved greater celandine, is a variant of the greater celandine plant. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. The foliage of this plant is characterized by its large, deeply lobed leaves that resemble the shape of oak leaves, giving it its common name. It produces bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in umbels. The plant contains various alkaloids and is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it is toxic if ingested."
