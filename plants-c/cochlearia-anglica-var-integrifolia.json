    "intro": "Cochlearia anglica var. integrifolia, commonly known as the English cochlearia, is a flowering plant native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lobed, hairy leaves and produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring. The species is typically found in coastal areas and calcareous soils, thriving in moist, well-drained environments. Its flowers are borne on slender, branching stems and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is distinguished by its entire leaf margins, which set it apart from other varieties of Cochlearia."
