    "intro": "Croton brittonianus, commonly known as the Britton's croton, is a shrub native to the southern United States, particularly Florida and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from yellow to red, which make it a popular ornamental plant. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkin-like inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
