    "intro": "Conyza myriocephala, commonly known as the common ironweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its stiff, hairy stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Conyza myriocephala is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields."
