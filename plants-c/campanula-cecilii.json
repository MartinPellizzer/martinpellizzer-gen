    "intro": "Campanula cecilii, commonly known as Cecil's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This species thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade conditions. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
