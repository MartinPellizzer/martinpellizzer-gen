    "intro": "Clethra kaipoensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian clethra, is a flowering plant native to the island of Hawaii. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and is adapted to the humid climate of the Hawaiian archipelago. Clethra kaipoensis is notable for its ecological importance, providing nectar for native pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
