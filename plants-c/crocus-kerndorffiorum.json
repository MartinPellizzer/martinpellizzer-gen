It is a perennial herb that produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during late winter or early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its bulbs are adapted for storage and survival through harsh winter conditions. The Kerndorff crocus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit."
