    "intro": "Ctenopteris maidenii, commonly known as the Maclay's sea holly, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, compound fronds that are typically divided into narrow, feather-like segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in coastal areas or near freshwater sources. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Ctenopteris maidenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
