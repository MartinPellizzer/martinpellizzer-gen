It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that are adapted for long-distance travel. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides. Conyza welwitschii is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its potential medicinal uses in traditional medicine."
