    "intro": "Calamagrostis arundinacea var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy reed grass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery, silver-green foliage that adds visual interest to gardens. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is a popular choice for water garden landscapes."
