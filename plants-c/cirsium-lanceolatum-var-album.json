    "intro": "Cirsium lanceolatum var. album, commonly known as the white thistle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, showy white to pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped, with rough, hairy surfaces and serrated edges. This variety is distinguished by its pale flower color, which sets it apart from other species in the Cirsium genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas."
