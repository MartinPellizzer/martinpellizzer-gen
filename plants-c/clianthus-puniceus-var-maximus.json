    "intro": "Clianthus puniceus var. maximus, commonly known as the New Zealand waratah, is a striking evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features showy, red or pink bract-like flowers that are actually modified leaves, not true petals. The plant has a woody stem with rough, hairy bark and is typically found in coastal areas with well-drained soil. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting birds and insects. The variety maximus is distinguished by its larger, more vibrant flowers compared to other varieties of Clianthus puniceus."
