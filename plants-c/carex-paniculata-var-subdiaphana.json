It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often a striking translucent green, giving it a unique visual appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in areas with standing water or saturated ground. Due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits, it is a popular choice for wetland restoration and ornamental gardening."
