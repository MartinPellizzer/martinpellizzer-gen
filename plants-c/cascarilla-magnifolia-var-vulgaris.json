    "intro": "Cascarilla magnifolia var. vulgaris, commonly known as the sweet birch, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark that exudes a pleasant, spicy scent when broken. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
