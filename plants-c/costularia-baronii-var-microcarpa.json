    "intro": "Costularia baronii var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited costularia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its compact growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture, often with a slightly waxy appearance. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal in the wild."
