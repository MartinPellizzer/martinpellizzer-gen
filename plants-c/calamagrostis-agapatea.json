    "intro": "Calamagrostis agapatea, commonly known as the silvergrass or silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, silver-gray leaves that give it a striking appearance. This plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Calamagrostis agapatea is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
