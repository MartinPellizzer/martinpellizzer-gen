It is a terrestrial orchid with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often with a distinctive red or purple lip. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it typically blooms in late winter or early spring. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
