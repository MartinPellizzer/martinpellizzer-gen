    "intro": "Castanea eonii, commonly known as the Eonii chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It produces large, spiny husks that encase its edible, sweet, and nutty seeds. The leaves are broad, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a dark green upper surface. The tree thrives in cool, moist climates and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its fruiting season typically occurs in late summer, making it a valuable resource for both wildlife and local communities."
