    "intro": "Calliandra rivularis, commonly known as the river calliandra, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows near water sources, such as rivers and streams, due to its preference for moist, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, feathery inflorescences that produce clusters of bright red or pink flowers. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, delicate leaflets, and it has a woody stem with thorn-like projections. Calliandra rivularis is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and vibrant blooms."
