    "intro": "Combretum cordatum, commonly known as the heart-shaped bushwillow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its woody structure and adaptability to various soil types make it a resilient species in its native habitat. Combretum cordatum is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
