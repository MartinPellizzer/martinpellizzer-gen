    "intro": "Clusia brachycarpa, commonly known as the broadleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically oval to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Clusia brachycarpa is adapted to humid, shaded environments and thrives in well-drained soil."
