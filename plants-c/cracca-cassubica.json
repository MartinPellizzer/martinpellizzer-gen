    "intro": "Cracca cassubica, commonly known as the Cassubian cracca, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb native to Central and Eastern Europe, often found in moist, calcareous soils. The plant features slender, branched stems and finely divided, pinnate leaves that contribute to its ornamental value. Its small white to pale yellow flowers appear in umbrella-like clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cracca cassubica is valued in horticulture for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in shaded or semi-shaded conditions."
