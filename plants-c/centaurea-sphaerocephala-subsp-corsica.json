    "intro": "Centaurea sphaerocephala subsp. corsica, commonly known as Corsican globeflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica. It is characterized by its spherical, bright red or orange flower heads, which are tightly packed and resemble small globes. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and is adapted to sunny, arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a grayish or silver hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
