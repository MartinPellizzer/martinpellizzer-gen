    "intro": "Cyperus permacer, commonly known as the everlasting sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, which are followed by cylindrical, spike-like fruits. Cyperus permacer thrives in wet or marshy environments, making it a common sight in swamps and along waterways. Its ability to survive in waterlogged soils makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
