    "intro": "Cactus clavatus, commonly known as the club cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in spines and are adapted to store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its root system is shallow and widespread, allowing it to efficiently absorb moisture from the soil. Despite its hardy nature, it requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
