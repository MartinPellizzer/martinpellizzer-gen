    "intro": "Cardamine melanthera, commonly known as the black-veined watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetlands and stream banks in North America. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a distinct dark green color and prominent veins, which contribute to its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its preference for moist, shaded environments makes it a common sight in riparian zones. Botanically, it is characterized by its basal rosette growth habit and its role as a food source for various insects and aquatic organisms."
