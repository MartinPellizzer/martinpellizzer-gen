    "intro": "Crucifera raphanistrum, commonly known as wild radish, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped with toothed margins. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by spherical, hairy pods containing several seeds. It is native to Europe and Asia but has been introduced to other parts of the world. Wild radish is often considered a weed but can also serve as a host plant for various insect species."
