    "intro": "Colchicum catacuzenium, commonly known as the Armenian colchic, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Turkey. It produces striking, violet-blue flowers during the late spring to early summer, typically emerging from a tunicated corm. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils. It is part of the Colchicaceae family and is known for its toxic alkaloids, which have historically been used in medicine. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
