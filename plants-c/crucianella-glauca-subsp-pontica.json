    "intro": "Crucianella glauca subsp. pontica, commonly known as the Pontic sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Black Sea. It is a low-growing perennial herb with distinctive blue-gray leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, often in saline or brackish environments. Its morphology is adapted to withstand coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity in its habitat."
