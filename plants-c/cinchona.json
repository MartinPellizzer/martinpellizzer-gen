It is native to the Andean region of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its evergreen shrubs or small trees, with compound leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The bark of certain species contains the alkaloid quinine, which has been historically used to treat malaria. Due to its medicinal value, Cinchona has been cultivated in tropical regions around the world."
