It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Carex chlorosaccus prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
