    "intro": "Carex flavocuspis, commonly known as the yellow-tipped sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems are usually shorter than the leaves, and the flowers are often pale yellow to greenish in color. Carex flavocuspis plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
