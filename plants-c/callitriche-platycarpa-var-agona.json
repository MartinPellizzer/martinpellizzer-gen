    "intro": "Callitriche platycarpa var. agona, commonly known as the broad-fruited water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that often lie close to the water surface, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and usually have a waxy coating. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and arranged in clusters, producing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and contributing to water quality through oxygen production."
