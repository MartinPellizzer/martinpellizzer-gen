    "intro": "Ceratozamia sancheziae, commonly known as the Sanchezwana cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
