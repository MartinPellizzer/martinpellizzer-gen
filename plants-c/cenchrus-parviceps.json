    "intro": "Cenchrus parviceps, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant adapted to drought conditions. Cenchrus parviceps is often used in erosion control and as forage for livestock in suitable climates."
