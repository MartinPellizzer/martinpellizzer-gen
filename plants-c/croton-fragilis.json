    "intro": "Croton fragilis, commonly known as the brittle croton, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically green with reddish veins and can vary in shape from ovate to elliptic. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange to red berries containing seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant."
