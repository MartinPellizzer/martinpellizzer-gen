    "intro": "Clematis vitalba, commonly known as the old man's beard, is a climbing vine native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its long, hanging clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three heart-shaped leaflets and possesses a woody stem with a rough, furrowed texture. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions and partial to full sun. Clematis vitalba is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
