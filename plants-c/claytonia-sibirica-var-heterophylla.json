    "intro": "Claytonia sibirica var. heterophylla, commonly known as Siberian spring beauty, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves and stems are succulent, adapted to survive in cold, arid environments. It is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
