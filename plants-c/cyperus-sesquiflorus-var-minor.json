    "intro": "Cyperus sesquiflorus var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf flatsedge, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways. Its botanical structure makes it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
