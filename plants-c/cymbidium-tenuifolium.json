    "intro": "Cymbidium tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leafed orchid, is a species native to East Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in temperate climates. The plant produces long, narrow leaves and is known for its fragrant, lance-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders. Cymbidium tenuifolium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its aesthetic and aromatic qualities."
