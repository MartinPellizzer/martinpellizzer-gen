    "intro": "Combretum laeteviride, commonly known as the green flame tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that turn bright yellow before falling in the dry season. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and urban landscapes for its striking foliage and seasonal color changes."
