    "intro": "Colococca, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, showy flowers that float on the surface of water, often displaying vibrant colors such as pink, white, and yellow. The leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Colococca species are found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
