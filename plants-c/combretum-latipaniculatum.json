    "intro": "Combretum latipaniculatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and striking foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
