    "intro": "Crataegus pyracanthoides, commonly known as the Pyracanthus hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems, which are a distinctive botanical feature, and its clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries that are edible for birds and some mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. The species is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade."
