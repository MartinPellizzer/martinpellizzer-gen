    "intro": "Cordia grisebachii, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its showy, white to pale pink inflorescences that resemble balls of snow. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by birds and mammals, contributing to its role in local ecosystems. Cordia grisebachii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
