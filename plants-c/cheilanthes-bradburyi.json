    "intro": "Cheilanthes bradburyi, commonly known as the Bradbury's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern typically found in arid and semi-arid environments, particularly in rocky soils. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form with short, thick rhizomes and a dense mat of dark green, leathery fronds. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters, and it is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions. This plant is often found in regions such as California and Baja California, where it thrives in crevices and on rock surfaces."
