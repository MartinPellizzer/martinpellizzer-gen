    "intro": "Caragana gobica, commonly known as the Siberian peashrub, is a deciduous shrub native to Central Asia and parts of Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 11 pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow pea-like flowers in early summer, followed by pod fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to harsh environments, including arid and semi-arid regions, and is often used for soil stabilization and erosion control. Caragana gobica is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in poor soils."
