    "intro": "Cleyera ekmanii, commonly known as the Hawaiian cleyera, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae, which includes hollies, and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
