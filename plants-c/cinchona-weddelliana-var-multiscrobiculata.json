    "intro": "Cinchona weddelliana var. multiscrobiculata, commonly known as the Weddell's quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries containing numerous seeds. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is closely related to other cinchona species known for their medicinal properties. Due to its ornamental value and historical significance in the production of quinine, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
