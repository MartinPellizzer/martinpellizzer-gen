    "intro": "Carex interior subsp. charlestonensis, commonly known as Charleston sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality in aquatic environments. This subspecies is relatively low maintenance and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
