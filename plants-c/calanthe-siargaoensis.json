    "intro": "Calanthe siargaoensis, commonly known as the Siargao Calanthe, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the Philippines. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and showy, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
