    "intro": "Codiaeum interruptum, commonly known as the flame tree or croton, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful leaves that display a wide range of hues, including red, orange, yellow, and green. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its striking foliage rather than its flowers, which are small and inconspicuous. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Codiaeum interruptum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes."
