    "intro": "Convolvulus filifolius, commonly known as the filifolius bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit, heart-shaped leaves, and small, pale yellow to white flowers. Its fibrous roots and rapid spread make it both a resilient weed and a potential invasive species in certain regions. Due to its adaptability, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
