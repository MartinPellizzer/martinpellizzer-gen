    "intro": "Cyclosorus impressus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia. It has delicate, floating leaves that are divided into narrow, linear segments, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Cyclosorus impressus is valued in aquascaping for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
