    "intro": "Cereus meonacanthus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to South America. It is a tall, spiny cactus that can grow up to 3 meters in height, featuring cylindrical stems covered in sharp, forward-pointing spines. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, typically during the summer months. These flowers are characterized by their showy, star-shaped petals and a strong, sweet scent. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and performing photosynthesis during the day while blooming at night."
