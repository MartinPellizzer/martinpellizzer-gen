    "intro": "Carex monopleura, commonly known as narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, triangular stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Carex monopleura is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
