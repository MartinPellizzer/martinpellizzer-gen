It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and bark. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and requires a humid, warm climate. Its bark is used to produce a spice similar to cinnamon, though it is less common than Cinnamomum verum. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
