    "intro": "Callistemon hainesii, commonly known as the Haines bottlebrush, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive bottlebrush-like inflorescences, which are composed of dense clusters of bright red or pink flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a popular choice for gardens in warm climates. The Haines bottlebrush is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native pollinators."
