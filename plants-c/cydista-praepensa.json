    "intro": "Cydista praepensa, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific wetland habitats in Europe. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, thriving in environments with consistent moisture. The plant features slender, erect stems with whorls of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small and pale greenish-white, often clustered in loose inflorescences. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes."
