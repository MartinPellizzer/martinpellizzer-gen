It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody, coral-like branches that give it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Corallodendron fuscum is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or well-drained soils."
