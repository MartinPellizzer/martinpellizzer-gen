    "intro": "Camassia engelmannii, commonly known as Engelmann's camas, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and showy blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands and meadows. It produces bulbous underground storage organs, which help it survive in its native habitat. The flowers bloom in early spring, making it an important early-season nectar source for pollinators."
