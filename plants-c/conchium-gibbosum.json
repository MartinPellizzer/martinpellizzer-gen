    "intro": "Conchium gibbosum, commonly known as the cushion lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its leaf-like thallus that forms dense, cushion-shaped growths. It typically grows on soil, rock, or wood in temperate and boreal regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. The thallus is usually green to yellowish in color, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. It consists of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal partner, which together carry out photosynthesis and nutrient absorption. This lichen is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
