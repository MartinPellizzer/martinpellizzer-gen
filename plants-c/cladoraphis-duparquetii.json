    "intro": "Cladoraphis duparquetii, commonly known as the yellow stinkhorn, is a unique fungus that belongs to the Phallales order. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow, slimy cap that emits a strong, unpleasant odor to attract flies for spore dispersal. The fungus typically grows on decaying wood, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Its life cycle involves a basidiomycete structure, with the fruiting body developing from a stalked base. Despite its noxious smell, it plays an important ecological role in decomposition and nutrient cycling."
