It is characterized by its aromatic, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that develop in dense clusters. The plant is native to wetland areas in Europe, Asia, and North America, often found in marshy or swampy habitats. Cinna species are known for their distinctive, fragrant rhizomes, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. Its botanical features make it well adapted to waterlogged soils and humid environments."
