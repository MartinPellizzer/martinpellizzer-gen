    "intro": "Caryopteris incana f. superba, commonly known as the silverleaf bluestem, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features striking, silver-gray foliage that turns reddish in the fall, adding visual interest throughout the growing season. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators like butterflies and bees. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
