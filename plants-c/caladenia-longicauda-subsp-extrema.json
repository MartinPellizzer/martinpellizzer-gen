    "intro": "Caladenia longicauda subsp. extrema, commonly known as the long-tailed spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Western Australia. It features a slender, erect stem with a single, narrow lanceolate leaf. The flower spike produces several pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with distinctive, elongated petals and sepals. It blooms during late spring to early summer, and its habitat is typically dry, open areas with sandy or gravelly soils. The subspecies is distinguished by its longer tail-like spur and specific geographic distribution within the southwestern region of Australia."
