    "intro": "Culcasia ekongoloi, commonly known as the African giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Africa. It features large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its stems help support the heavy foliage. Culcasia ekongoloi plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
