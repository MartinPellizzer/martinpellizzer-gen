It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. Crinum longistylum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in warm, humid climates."
