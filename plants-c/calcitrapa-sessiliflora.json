    "intro": "Calcitrapa sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flowered calcitrapa, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is characterized by its low, spreading growth habit. The plant features small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Calcitrapa sessiliflora is adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often found in coastal or inland rocky habitats."
