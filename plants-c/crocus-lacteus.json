    "intro": "Crocus lacteus, commonly known as the milk crocus, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a distinctive pinkish tinge. The plant typically blooms in early spring, before the leaves fully emerge, and is characterized by its small, grass-like foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. The flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their delicate appearance and fleeting bloom period."
