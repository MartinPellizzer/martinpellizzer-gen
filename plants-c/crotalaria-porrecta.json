    "intro": "Crotalaria porrecta, commonly known as the straight cowpea or porrecta morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features palmately compound leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Crotalaria porrecta is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, where it thrives in full sun. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, and the plant is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
