    "intro": "Chamaecrista egleri, commonly known as the yellow burr legume, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant bears pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
