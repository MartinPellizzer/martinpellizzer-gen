    "intro": "Carex shiriyajirensis, commonly known as the Shiriyajirensis sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered spikelets that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. Carex shiriyajirensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wetland ecosystems."
