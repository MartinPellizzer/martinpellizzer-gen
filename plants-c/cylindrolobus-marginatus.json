    "intro": "Cylindrolobus marginatus, commonly known as the marginate cylinder lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family. It is a crustose lichen, typically forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is dark grey to black, with a granular texture and distinct marginal zones. It is often found in humid, shaded environments, particularly on calcareous substrates. This lichen is notable for its chemical composition, containing usnic acid and other secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role."
