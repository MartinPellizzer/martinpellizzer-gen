    "intro": "Colocasia antiquorum var. nymphaeifolia, commonly known as the water arum, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, often with a waxy, glossy surface. The plant produces striking purple spathe flowers that bloom in the summer, surrounded by a spadix that is often covered in a dense cluster of tiny, white flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated in ponds or water gardens. Its foliage and floral displays make it a popular choice for tropical landscapes and indoor cultivation."
