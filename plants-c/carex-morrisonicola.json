It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in shaded environments and is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding. Carex morrisonicola plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
