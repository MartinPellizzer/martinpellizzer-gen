It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open habitats, thriving in temperate climates. Its dense arrangement of small flowers gives it its common name, and it produces both ray and disk florets. Coelia densiflora is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
