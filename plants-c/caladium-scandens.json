    "intro": "Caladium scandens, commonly known as the climbing caladium, is a tropical vine native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, brightly colored leaves that come in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that are followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires partial to full sunlight. Caladium scandens is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowers."
