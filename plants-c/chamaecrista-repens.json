    "intro": "Chamaecrista repens, commonly known as creeping cassia, is a perennial leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by narrow, pod-like fruits. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. Chamaecrista repens is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides."
