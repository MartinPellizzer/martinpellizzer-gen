    "intro": "Cecropia scutata, commonly known as the broad-leafed cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, spiny calyces. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with ants, which reside in the hollow stems and protect the tree from herbivores. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common species in disturbed habitats. The plant also plays a role in local ecosystems by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
