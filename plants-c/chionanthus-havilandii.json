    "intro": "Chionanthus havilandii, commonly known as the white-fringed tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, white, fringed flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release tiny seeds. Chionanthus havilandii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade."
