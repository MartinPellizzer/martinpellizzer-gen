    "intro": "Cremanthodium palmatum, commonly known as the palmate cremanthodium, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is distinguished by its palmately lobed leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is often found in the Andes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
