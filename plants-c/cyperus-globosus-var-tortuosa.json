    "intro": "Cyperus globosus var. tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in water gardens and wetland restoration projects."
