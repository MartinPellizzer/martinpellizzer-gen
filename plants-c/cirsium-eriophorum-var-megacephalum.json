    "intro": "Cirsium eriophorum var. megacephalum, commonly known as the giant thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, spiny, purple to pink flower heads that are surrounded by dense, white to grayish-green bracts. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with rough, hairy surfaces and serrated edges, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
