    "intro": "Carex transalaica, commonly known as the Transalpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. This species typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its grass-like foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are usually green to bluish-green in color. Carex transalaica produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, contributing to its ecological role in wetland habitats."
