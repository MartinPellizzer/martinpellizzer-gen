    "intro": "Centradenia inaequilateralis var. major, commonly known as the large-leaved centradenia, is a tropical shrub native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically larger and more robust compared to other varieties of the species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and birds. Its woody stems are covered in a rough, bark-like texture, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in subtropical gardens."
