    "intro": "Calystegia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is a vigorous climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dry seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often becoming invasive. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it a notable species in botanical studies."
