    "intro": "Caralluma grandidens, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of India and parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, spine-tipped stems that form a branching structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are usually reduced to small spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Caralluma grandidens is also known for its ability to store water in its thick stems, making it well adapted to survive in drought conditions."
