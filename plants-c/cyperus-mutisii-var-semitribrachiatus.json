    "intro": "Cyperus mutisii var. semitribrachiatus, commonly known as the narrow-bracted flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like structures, which are often subtended by leaf-like bracts. This variety is distinguished by its reduced bract structure compared to other Cyperus species, making it a unique member of the genus."
