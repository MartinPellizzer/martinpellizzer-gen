    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris dentata, commonly known as the toothed chickweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is an annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. The species is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
