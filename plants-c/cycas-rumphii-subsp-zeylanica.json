    "intro": "Cycas rumphii subsp. zeylanica, commonly known as the Sri Lankan cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Sri Lanka. It is a dioecious plant, meaning that male and female reproductive structures are found on separate individuals. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female spores, which are essential for its reproduction. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, palm-like appearance. This species is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in well-drained soils in shaded environments."
