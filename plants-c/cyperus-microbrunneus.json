    "intro": "Cyperus microbrunneus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flat sedge, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to saturated soils. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often a reddish-brown color, giving it its common name. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Cyperus microbrunneus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
