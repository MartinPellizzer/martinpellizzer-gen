    "intro": "Ceratozamia mexicana f. fuscoviridis, commonly known as the dark green cycad, is a rare and endangered plant species native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinct midrib and serrated margins. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is critically endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
