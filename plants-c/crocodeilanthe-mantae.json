    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe mantae, commonly known as the Malay pitcher plant, is a unique carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Nepenthaceae family and is characterized by its large, hollow, pitcher-shaped leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant's structure is adapted for nutrient absorption, as it grows in nutrient-poor soil. Its nectar-producing rim attracts prey, while the inner surface secretes digestive enzymes. Despite its carnivorous nature, it plays a vital role in its ecosystem by controlling insect populations."
