It is characterized by its elegant, pyramidal shape and scale-like foliage that turns a striking blue-green color in the winter. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, releasing seeds in the spring. Its bark is reddish-brown and peels in thin, papery strips, adding to its ornamental appeal. This species is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value and adaptability to various soil types."
