    "intro": "Centaurea bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous knapweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces small, spiky flowers in shades of red, purple, and yellow. The plant has basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stem is usually hairy as well. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Centaurea bulbosa is often found in disturbed areas and is known for its ability to colonize open spaces rapidly."
