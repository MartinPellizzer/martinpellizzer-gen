    "intro": "Cassebeera ternifolia, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic tree native to tropical coastal regions. It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which allow it to absorb oxygen from the air in waterlogged soils. The plant thrives in brackish and saltwater environments, playing a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. Its leaves are alternate and elliptical, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Cassebeera ternifolia is also notable for its small, red, fleshy fruits that provide food for various wildlife species."
