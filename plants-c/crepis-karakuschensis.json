It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and yellowish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
