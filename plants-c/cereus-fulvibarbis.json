It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its flowers are known for their intense yellow coloration at the tips, giving it its common name. Cereus fulvibarbis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements."
