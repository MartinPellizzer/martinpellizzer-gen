    "intro": "Clematis cylindrica var. lineariloba, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clematis, is a climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It features slender, wiry stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller and more elongated than those of the typical clematis species. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for trellises or arbors. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular selection for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance climbing plant."
