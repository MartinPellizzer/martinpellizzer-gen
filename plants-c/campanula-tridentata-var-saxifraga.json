    "intro": "Campanula tridentata var. saxifraga, commonly known as the rock campanula, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
