    "intro": "Connarus attopoevensis, commonly known as the Brazilian ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Lecythidaceae and is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has large, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy, and it produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ecological importance and slow growth rate, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
