    "intro": "Cochliasanthus caracalla, commonly known as the Chinese lantern tree, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, orange-red seed pods that resemble small lanterns, which split open to release seeds. The tree has simple, alternate, ovate leaves with a rough texture and a slightly serrated margin. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring. The plant is valued for its ornamental seed pods and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant autumn display."
