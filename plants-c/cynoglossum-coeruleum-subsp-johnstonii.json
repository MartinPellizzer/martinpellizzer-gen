It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. The plant features lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces clusters of blue to violet flowers. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in the British Isles. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
