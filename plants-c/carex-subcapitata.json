    "intro": "Carex subcapitata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown in color. This species is often found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation. Carex subcapitata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
