    "intro": "Campomanesia martiana, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are often used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in coastal and lowland regions. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
