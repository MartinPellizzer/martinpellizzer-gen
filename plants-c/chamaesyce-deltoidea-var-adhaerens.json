    "intro": "Chamaesyce deltoidea var. adhaerens, commonly known as the stickyleaf sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending habit, with hairy, deltoid-shaped leaves that often adhere to surfaces. The leaves are covered in fine, sticky trichomes, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the axils of the leaves, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. This species is often found in sandy or gravelly soils in arid environments."
