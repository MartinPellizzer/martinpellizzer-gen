    "intro": "Clematis elliptica, commonly known as the Chinese clematis, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth texture and a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a climbing plant in gardens. Clematis elliptica is relatively low maintenance but requires well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
