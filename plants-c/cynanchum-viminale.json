    "intro": "Cynanchum viminale, commonly known as the creeping milkweed, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Cynanchum viminale is adapted to grow in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks."
