    "intro": "Chromolaena iridolepis, commonly known as the rainbow weed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often giving it a striking visual appearance. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Chromolaena iridolepis is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively, making it a common invasive species in many regions."
