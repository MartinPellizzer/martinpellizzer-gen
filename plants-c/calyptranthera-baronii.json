    "intro": "Calyptranthera baronii, commonly known as the Baron's calypso, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic nature. It is a small, herbaceous plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
