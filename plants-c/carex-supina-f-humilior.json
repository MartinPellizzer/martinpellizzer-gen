    "intro": "Carex supina f. humilior, commonly known as the low-growing sedges, is a variant of the common sedge, Carex supina. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit. The plant features cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. This form is notable for its shorter stature compared to the typical Carex supina, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces or naturalized areas."
