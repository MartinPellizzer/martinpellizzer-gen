    "intro": "Carex drepanorhyncha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest edges. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
