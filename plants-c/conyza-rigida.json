    "intro": "Conyza rigida, commonly known as rough hawksbeard, is an annual flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with serrated edges, and its yellow flowers appear in clusters at the top of the stems. Conyza rigida is known for its ability to produce a large number of seeds, which are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
