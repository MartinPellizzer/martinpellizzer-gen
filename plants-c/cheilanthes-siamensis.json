    "intro": "Cheilanthes siamensis, commonly known as the Siam wall-rug, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with dense, overlapping, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its fronds are usually pale green to bluish-green, and it produces small, sporangia-bearing clusters on the underside of the leaves. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient and hardy plant."
