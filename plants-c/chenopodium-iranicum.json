It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of pubescence. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits called utricles. Chenopodium iranicum is valued for its adaptability to harsh conditions and has been used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some regions."
