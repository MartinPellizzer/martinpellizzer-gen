    "intro": "Cuscuta upcraftii, commonly known as the upcreek dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves germinating on the surface of host plants. The plant's stem is covered in tiny, hair-like structures that help it attach to its host. It is native to the western United States and is often found growing on various shrubs and grasses. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
