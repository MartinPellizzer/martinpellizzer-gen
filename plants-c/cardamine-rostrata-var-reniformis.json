    "intro": "Cardamine rostrata var. reniformis, commonly known as the broad-leaved water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring. The leaves and stems are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss and provide structural support in aquatic environments."
