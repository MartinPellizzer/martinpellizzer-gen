    "intro": "Cerastium latifolium var. smithii, commonly known as Smith's hairy mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and dense clusters of small, white flowers. The leaves are typically hairy, ovate, and arranged in a basal rosette, while the stems are slender and often covered with fine pubescence. This plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native environment."
