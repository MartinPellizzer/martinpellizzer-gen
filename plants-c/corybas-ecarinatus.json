    "intro": "Corybas ecarinatus, commonly known as the hooded helmet orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, hood-like floral structure that encloses the reproductive organs, a feature typical of many orchids. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a deep purple or violet hue, often with intricate patterns on the labellum. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
