    "intro": "Cardamine macrophylla f. pauciflora, commonly known as the slender watercress, is a herbaceous perennial belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in racemes, which are often fewer in number compared to the typical species. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in water, while its stems are flexible and buoyant. This fern-like aquatic plant is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams."
