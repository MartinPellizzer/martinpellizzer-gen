It is native to Europe and western Asia and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has a taproot system and produces achenes as its fruit, which are dispersed by wind. The species is sometimes used in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
