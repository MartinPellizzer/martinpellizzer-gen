    "intro": "Convolvulus major, commonly known as the greater bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing stems that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are heart-shaped and opposite, with a rough texture. Convolvulus major is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in waste areas, where it can become invasive."
