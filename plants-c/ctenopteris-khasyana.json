    "intro": "Ctenopteris khasyana, commonly known as the Khasi water fern, is a species of marine fern found in the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged in tidal zones. The plant thrives in brackish water environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sediment and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its rhizomes are often anchored in the substrate, allowing it to spread along the shoreline. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps them withstand the harsh conditions of the intertidal zone."
