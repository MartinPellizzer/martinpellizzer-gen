    "intro": "Celastrus annamensis, commonly known as the Annam prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often prickly leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as food for certain wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
