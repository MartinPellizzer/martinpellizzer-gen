It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are usually broad and heart-shaped, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Cyanea truncata plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting various pollinators and contributing to coastal vegetation."
