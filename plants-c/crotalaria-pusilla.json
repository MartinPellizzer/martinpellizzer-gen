    "intro": "Crotalaria pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf rattlepod, is a small annual herb native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, making it a low-growing species. Its pods contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds, and it is often found in disturbed soils and grasslands. Crotalaria pusilla is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
