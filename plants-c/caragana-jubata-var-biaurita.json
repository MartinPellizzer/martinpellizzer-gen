    "intro": "Caragana jubata var. biaurita, commonly known as the yellow peashrub, is a shrub native to central Asia, including regions of China and the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, followed by pea-like pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and semi-desert environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a ornamental plant in arid landscapes."
