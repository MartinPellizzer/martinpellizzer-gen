    "intro": "Cyclophorus lauterbachii, commonly known as the Lauterbach's cyclophorus, is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a compact cluster, and its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sun-exposed areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native region."
