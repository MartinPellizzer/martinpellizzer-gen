It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive inflorescence structure. The plant typically grows in moist, mountainous habitats, often in cloud forests or high-altitude grasslands. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a cluster. Centropogon casapiensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
