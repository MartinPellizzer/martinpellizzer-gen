    "intro": "Cyclophorus assimilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cyclophorus, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, a typical feature of the carrot family. It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within its native range."
