    "intro": "Cactus pugionacanthus, commonly known as the Mexican devil's backbone, is a spineless cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered in soft, greenish-gray spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and rockeries."
