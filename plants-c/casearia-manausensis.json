    "intro": "Casearia manausensis, commonly known as the Manaus casearia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range."
