    "intro": "Cirsium horridum subsp. prasinolepis, commonly known as the greenleaf thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, leafy stems and large, showy purple to pink flower heads. The leaves are typically lance-shaped with rough, serrated edges and a hairy texture. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant produces seeds in a composite flower head, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
