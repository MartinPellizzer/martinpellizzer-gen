    "intro": "Cerastium pentandrum subsp. gracile, commonly known as slender mouse-ear, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, spoon-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are usually prostrate or ascending, and the leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs. It is often found in moist meadows and along the edges of forests, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
