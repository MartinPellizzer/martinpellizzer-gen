    "intro": "Caesalpinia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved burr legume, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forests or savannas. Caesalpinia parvifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
