    "intro": "Chamomilla recutita, commonly known as German chamomile, is an annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, and its aromatic, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Its flowers are harvested before full bloom to maximize essential oil content, which is rich in compounds like bisabolol and chamazulene. Chamomilla recutita is widely cultivated for its medicinal and aromatic properties."
