    "intro": "Corylus cornuta f. inermis, commonly known as the smooth hazelnut, is a variant of the hazelnut species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless nut shells, distinguishing it from the more commonly cultivated European hazelnut. The plant produces small, deciduous leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. The smooth hazelnut is valued for its ornamental appeal and its edible nuts, which are smaller and less commonly harvested than those of other hazelnut varieties."
