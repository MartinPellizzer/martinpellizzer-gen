    "intro": "Chamaepericlimenum, commonly known as the climbing chickweed, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features small, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, often with hairy surfaces. The plant produces tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, usually in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often prostrate or trailing, allowing it to spread along the ground or climb over other vegetation. Chamaepericlimenum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
