    "intro": "Cephalanthera longifolia var. gibbosa, commonly known as the wavy lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and dense clusters of pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and requires specific soil conditions to thrive. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
