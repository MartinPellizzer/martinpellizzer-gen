    "intro": "Ceanothus foliosus, commonly known as the coast ceanothus, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and southern Oregon. It features aromatic, evergreen foliage with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of sky-blue or white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal climates. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soils make it a popular choice in native plant gardens."
