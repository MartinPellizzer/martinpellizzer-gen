    "intro": "Castilleja serrata, commonly known as the Sierra milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a slender, branched stem and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Castilleja serrata forms symbiotic relationships with certain fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil."
