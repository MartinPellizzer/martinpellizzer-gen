    "intro": "Crassula zimmermannii, commonly known as the Woolly Crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is a compact shrub that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and indoor settings."
