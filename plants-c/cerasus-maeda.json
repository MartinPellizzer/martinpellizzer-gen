    "intro": "Cerasus maeda, commonly known as the Maeda cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart red berries. Its leaves are elliptical, with a smooth texture and a slightly serrated edge. Cerasus maeda is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks."
