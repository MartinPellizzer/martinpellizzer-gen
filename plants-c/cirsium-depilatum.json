    "intro": "Cirsium depilatum, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green leaves and purple to pink flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which give it a woolly appearance. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
