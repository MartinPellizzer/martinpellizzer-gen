    "intro": "Calendula suffruticosa, commonly known as the shrub marigold, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and vibrant, daisy-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, and the plant is known for its aromatic, slightly bitter scent. Calendula suffruticosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
