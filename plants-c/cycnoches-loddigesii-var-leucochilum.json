    "intro": "Cycnoches loddigesii var. leucochilum, commonly known as the white-lipped cycnoches, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern, including a white lip that sets it apart from other cycnoches varieties. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in cloud forests or along riverbanks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
