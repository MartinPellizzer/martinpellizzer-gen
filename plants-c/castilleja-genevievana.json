    "intro": "Castilleja genevievana, commonly known as the Genevieve's paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, commonly referred to as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its striking red or orange flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
