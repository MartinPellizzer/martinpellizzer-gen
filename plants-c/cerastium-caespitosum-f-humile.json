    "intro": "Cerastium caespitosum f. humile, commonly known as the dwarf mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine white pubescence, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover."
