    "intro": "Calliandra tortuensis, commonly known as the twisted calliandra, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging branches and compound leaves that are often divided into small, feather-like segments. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which bloom throughout the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen, it also has potential as a forage plant and in ecological restoration projects."
