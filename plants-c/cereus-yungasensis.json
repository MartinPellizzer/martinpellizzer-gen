    "intro": "Cereus yungasensis, commonly known as the Yungas Cereus, is a cactus species native to the humid cloud forests of Bolivia and Peru. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a common trait among many cacti in the Cereus genus. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system adapted to absorb moisture from the moist, nutrient-rich soil. This species is well-suited to the cool, misty conditions of its high-altitude habitat."
