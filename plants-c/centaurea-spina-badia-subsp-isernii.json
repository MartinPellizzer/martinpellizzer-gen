    "intro": "Centaurea spina-badia subsp. isernii, commonly known as the Isern's thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, erect stems and striking purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
