    "intro": "Cyathea mesocarpa, commonly known as the medium-fruited tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in strobili, a feature typical of many ferns. Cyathea mesocarpa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of tropical rainforest ecosystems."
