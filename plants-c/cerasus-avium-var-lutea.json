    "intro": "Cerasus avium var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow cherry, is a variant of the sweet cherry species native to Europe. It is characterized by its yellowish-orange fruits, which contrast with the typical red or dark red coloration of standard cherries. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a glossy green upper surface. The flowers are white and appear in early spring, preceding the fruiting season."
