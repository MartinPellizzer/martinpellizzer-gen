    "intro": "Coleotrype vermigera, commonly known as the red-stained bracket fungus, is a wood-rotting basidiomycete that primarily decomposes dead hardwoods. It is characterized by its thick, bracket-shaped fruiting bodies that often have a reddish or orange-brown coloration. The undersurface of the cap is covered with small, crowded pores rather than gills. This fungus is typically found on decaying trees in forested areas, especially in temperate climates. It plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling by breaking down lignin and cellulose in dead wood."
