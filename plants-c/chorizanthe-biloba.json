    "intro": "Chorizanthe biloba, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Chorizanthe biloba is known for its ability to thrive in harsh conditions, making it an important component of desert ecosystems."
