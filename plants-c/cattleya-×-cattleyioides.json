    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 cattleyioides, commonly known as the hybrid cattleya, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink, purple, and orange. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Cattleya \u00d7 cattleyioides is prized for its fragrant blooms and is a popular choice for both ornamental gardening and hybridization."
