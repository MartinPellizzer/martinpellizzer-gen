The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
