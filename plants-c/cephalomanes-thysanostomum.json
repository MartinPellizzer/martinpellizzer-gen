    "intro": "Cephalomanes thysanostomum, commonly known as the hairy-headed barnacle, is a marine bryozoan that exhibits a distinctive colonial structure. It forms dense, encrusting colonies on submerged surfaces such as rocks and shells in shallow coastal waters. The zooids are small and possess a unique combination of a short, conical funicle and a complex, branched lophophore. Its reproductive system includes both sexual and asexual reproduction, with the production of both ova and larvae. The plant's morphology is adapted for filter feeding, with specialized structures for capturing planktonic organisms from the surrounding water."
