It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange-pink inflorescences that appear in clusters, adding vibrant color to the landscape. The plant has bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. It produces elongated, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Caesalpinia standleyi thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as savannas and forest edges."
