    "intro": "Ceropegia hystrix, commonly known as the zigzagging ceropegia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems that help it climb and spread across rocky surfaces. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often pale green or white, adapted for specific pollinators. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Ceropegia hystrix is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
