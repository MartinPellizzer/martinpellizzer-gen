    "intro": "Cerastium mollissimum, commonly known as downy mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early summer, which are typically arranged in umbels. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens and naturalized landscapes."
