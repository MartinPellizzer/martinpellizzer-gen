    "intro": "Centaurea \u00d7 frayana, commonly known as the hybrid cornflower, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Centaurea cyanus (blue cornflower) and Centaurea solstitialis (yellow starthistle). The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves and showy composite flowers that range from blue to purple. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for garden cultivation and ecological restoration projects."
