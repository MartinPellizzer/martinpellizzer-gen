    "intro": "Ceropegia umbellata, commonly known as the starfish fig or string of hearts, is a climbing succulent native to southern Africa. It features trailing stems with fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which are pollinated by specific moths. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Its unique appearance and ability to trail make it a popular choice for hanging baskets and shelves."
