    "intro": "Cereus incrustans, commonly known as the rock cactus or incrustation cactus, is a species of cactus native to the dry regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a thick, crust-like appearance. The plant produces white, tubular flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. Cereus incrustans is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
