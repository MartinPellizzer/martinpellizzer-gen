    "intro": "Centropogon aquilinus, commonly known as the bluebells of the Caribbean, is a flowering plant native to the Greater Antilles. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Centropogon aquilinus is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitats."
