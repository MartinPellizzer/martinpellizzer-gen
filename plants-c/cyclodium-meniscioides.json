It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, succulent growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically yellow or white, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are fleshy and adapted to store water, making it well-suited for drought conditions. Cyclodium meniscioides is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping."
