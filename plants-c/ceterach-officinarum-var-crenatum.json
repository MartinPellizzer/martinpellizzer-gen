    "intro": "Ceterach officinarum var. crenatum, commonly known as the coastal ceterach, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a powdery white coating, which helps reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found growing in sheltered coastal areas. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered an important component of coastal ecosystems in New Zealand."
