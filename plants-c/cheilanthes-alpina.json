    "intro": "Cheilanthes alpina, commonly known as the alpine lip fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that often curl at the tips. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Cheilanthes alpina is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging climates."
