    "intro": "Clematis recta var. uncinata, commonly known as the hooked clematis, is a climbing vine native to parts of Asia. It features slender, woody stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun. The variety is distinguished by its hooked thorns, which are more pronounced than in other clematis species."
