    "intro": "Cotoneaster elegans, commonly known as the silver cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that turn reddish-brown in autumn. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness. Cotoneaster elegans typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in well-drained soils."
