It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and dense, leathery leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces a resinous sap that is harvested as myrrh, a fragrant substance used in traditional medicine and religious ceremonies. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in rocky soils. The tree is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used for centuries in various cultural and medicinal practices."
