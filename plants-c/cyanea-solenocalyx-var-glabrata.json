    "intro": "Cyanea solenocalyx var. glabrata, commonly known as the glabrous Cyanea, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that are typically white or pink in color. The plant has smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, which give it its varietal name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
