    "intro": "Cyperus humilis, commonly known as the dwarf sedgeland, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically forms dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. It thrives in wet or moist soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, it is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
