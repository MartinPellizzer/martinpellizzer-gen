    "intro": "Cynorkis angustipetala var. moramangensis, commonly known as the Moramanga orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the humid lowland forests of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the canopy layer of the forest. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with darker pigments. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
