It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 4 meters in height, characterized by its palmate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland and savanna habitats. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
