    "intro": "Cicutaria bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbous watercress, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in the Americas. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces bulb-like structures at the base of its stems, which can be used for propagation. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Cicutaria bulbifera is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to that of watercress."
