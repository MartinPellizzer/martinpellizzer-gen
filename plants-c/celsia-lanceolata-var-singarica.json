    "intro": "Celsia lanceolata var. singarica, commonly known as the Singarica celsia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
