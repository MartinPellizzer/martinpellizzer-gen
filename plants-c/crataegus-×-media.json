    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 media, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to elliptical leaves, and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Botanically, it is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Crataegus monogyna and Crataegus laevigata, exhibiting a mix of traits from both parent species."
