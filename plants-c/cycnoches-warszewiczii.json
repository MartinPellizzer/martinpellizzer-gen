    "intro": "Cycnoches warszewiczii, commonly known as the Warszewicz's cycnoches, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with intricate patterns and a unique coloration that ranges from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, with a smooth texture and a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cycnoches warszewiczii is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its natural habitat."
