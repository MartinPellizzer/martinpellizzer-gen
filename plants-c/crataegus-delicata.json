    "intro": "Crataegus delicata, commonly known as the silky crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 feet and features slender, often thornless branches. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, red or yellow berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges and a glossy upper surface. Crataegus delicata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its showy blooms and autumn fruit."
