    "intro": "Cistus heterophyllus, commonly known as the sticky holly or rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that exude a sticky resin when crushed. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its hairy stems and evergreen foliage make it well adapted to rocky, arid environments. The resinous properties of Cistus heterophyllus have historically been used in traditional medicine and perfumery."
