    "intro": "Chionanthus longipetalus, commonly known as the long-petaled snowbell, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall, adding to its seasonal interest. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. The long-petaled snowbell is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
