    "intro": "Calophanes capitatus, commonly known as the golden star lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a yellowish to orange-brown thallus with distinct, star-shaped lobes that give it its common name. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and substrate. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forests. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for air quality and ecosystem health."
