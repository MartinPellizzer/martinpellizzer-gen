It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for soil stabilization in harsh environments. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, enhancing its drought tolerance. Calligonum jeminaicum plays an important ecological role in preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for local wildlife."
