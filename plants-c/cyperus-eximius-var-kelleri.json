    "intro": "Cyperus eximius var. kelleri, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves and a striking, umbrella-like inflorescence. The plant thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable wetland indicator and a potential invasive species. Botanically, it belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family."
