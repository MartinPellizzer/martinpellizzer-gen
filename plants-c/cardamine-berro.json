    "intro": "Cardamine berro, commonly known as the lesser watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to moist, temperate regions. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like buttercups and larkspur. The plant typically grows in stream banks, wet meadows, and shaded woodlands, thriving in cool, damp environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring. The plant is often found in shaded, nutrient-rich soils and is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
