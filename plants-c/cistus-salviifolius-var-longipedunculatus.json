    "intro": "Cistus salviifolius var. longipedunculatus, commonly known as the long-stemmed rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for dry, coastal environments. Its aromatic foliage and showy flowers make it a valuable addition to xeriscapic gardens. The variety is distinguished by its longer peduncles, which support its floral display."
