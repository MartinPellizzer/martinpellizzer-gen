    "intro": "Couthovia novobritannica, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of New Britannia. It features broad, waxy leaves that reflect sunlight, aiding in water conservation in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and violet, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its fruit is a toxic berry that contains alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
