    "intro": "Curcuma parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered turmeric, is a member of the Zingiberaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers, which are often overlooked compared to its more showy relatives. Its leaves are broad and sword-shaped, and the rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Curcuma parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties."
