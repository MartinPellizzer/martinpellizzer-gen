    "intro": "Callista jenkinsii, commonly known as the Jenkins' callista, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are usually pale yellow or white, and the plant produces small, round fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated. Callista jenkinsii is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and exposure to sea breezes."
