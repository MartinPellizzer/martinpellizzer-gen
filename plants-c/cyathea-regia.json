    "intro": "Cyathea regia, commonly known as the royal tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a trunk that is often covered in a fibrous, spongy layer. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Cyathea regia plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
