    "intro": "Coryphopteris dura, commonly known as the tough fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a serrated edge. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in moist, well-drained soil. Coryphopteris dura is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
