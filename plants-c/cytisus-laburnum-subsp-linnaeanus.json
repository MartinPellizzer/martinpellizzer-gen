It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of bright yellow pea-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple small leaflets, and the plant produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and hedging.
