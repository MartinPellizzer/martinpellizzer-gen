    "intro": "Cleome steveniana, commonly known as spider flower, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped, serrated leaves, and it produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Cleome steveniana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blooms and relatively low maintenance requirements."
