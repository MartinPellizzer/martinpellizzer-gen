    "intro": "Coleosanthus pinifolius, commonly known as the needleleaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and its distinctive, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a dense, feathery crown. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with the male and female cones typically growing on separate plants. Its foliage is evergreen, and it exhibits a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived species. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
