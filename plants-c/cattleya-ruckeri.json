    "intro": "Cattleya ruckeri, commonly known as the Rucker's Cattleya, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange with intricate patterns. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences, and its blooms are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cattleya ruckeri is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in a horizontal manner with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive in cultivation."
