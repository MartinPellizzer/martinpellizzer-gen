It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes other members such as buckwheat and smartweed. Cousinia congesta is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
