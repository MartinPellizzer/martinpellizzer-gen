    "intro": "Ctenitis nephrodioides, commonly known as the kidney-leaf fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that resemble the shape of a kidney. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. Its fronds are typically dark green and can grow up to several meters in length. Ctenitis nephrodioides thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
