    "intro": "Cayaponia citrullifolia var. breviloba, commonly known as the dwarf bottle tree, is a unique species native to parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, a feature adapted to its arid environment. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. This variety is more compact than the typical Cayaponia citrullifolia, making it suitable for smaller gardens or container planting."
