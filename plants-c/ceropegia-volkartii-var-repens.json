It features fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive, intricate structure. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
