    "intro": "Croton migrans, commonly known as the wandering croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can be elliptic, ovate, or even triangular in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, spiny capsules containing numerous seeds. Its adaptability to different soil types and light conditions makes it a resilient species in its native habitat. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
