    "intro": "Cephalotaxus sinensis subsp. hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan yew, is a rare evergreen conifer native to southern China. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and distinctive, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries, which are an important food source for certain bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
