    "intro": "Cranichis pulvinifera, commonly known as the cushion orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with small, rounded leaves that form a cushion-like structure. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear clusters of delicate, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its unique appearance and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
