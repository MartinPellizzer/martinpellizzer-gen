It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland areas. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring. The hairy texture of its foliage is a distinguishing feature that aids in its identification."
