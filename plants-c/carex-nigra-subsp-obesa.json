    "intro": "Carex nigra subsp. obesa, commonly known as black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and produces spikes of small, brownish flowers in the summer. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are narrow and strap-like, with a smooth texture and a distinctive dark coloration."
