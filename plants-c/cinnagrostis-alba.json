    "intro": "Cinnagrostis alba, commonly known as white goatweed, is a flowering plant native to southern and eastern Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in wetlands. Its white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Cinnagrostis alba is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
