    "intro": "Castanea crenata var. longispina, commonly known as the Japanese chestnut or longispine chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its spiny buds and oval, pointed leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins, followed by edible, spiny nuts enclosed in a thick, scaly husk. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been cultivated for its nuts, which are less bitter than those of other chestnut species. This variety is also noted for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in temperate climates."
