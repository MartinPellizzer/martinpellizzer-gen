    "intro": "Campanula schistosa var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or violet. The leaves are lanceolate and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
