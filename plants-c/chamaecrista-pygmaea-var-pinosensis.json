    "intro": "Chamaecrista pygmaea var. pinosensis, commonly known as the coastal burr legume, is a small, shrub-like plant native to coastal regions of California. It features trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along the coast. It plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and provides habitat for various insects. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
