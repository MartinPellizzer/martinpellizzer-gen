    "intro": "Catasetum sophiae, commonly known as the noble orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces unique, specialized structures called \"catasetums,\" which are used in pollination by specific bee species. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Catasetum sophiae is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinator biodiversity."
