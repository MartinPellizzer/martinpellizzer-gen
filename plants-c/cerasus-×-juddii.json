    "intro": "Cerasus \u00d7 juddii, commonly known as the Japanese cherry, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Prunus serrulata and Prunus lusitanica. It is characterized by its ornamental value, particularly during the spring when it produces clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers. The plant is native to Japan and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and parks. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it adaptable to various climates. The fruit, though edible, is less commonly consumed compared to its ornamental significance."
