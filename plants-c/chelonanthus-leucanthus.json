    "intro": "Chelonanthus leucanthus, commonly known as the white-flowered chelonanthus, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically dark blue or black when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
