    "intro": "Celosia trigyna, commonly known as the flame flower or coxcomb, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, feather-like bracts that form a crown-like appearance, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is known for its short, upright growth habit. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers at the base of the bracts, which are primarily pollinated by insects. Celosia trigyna is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant colors and long-lasting blooms."
