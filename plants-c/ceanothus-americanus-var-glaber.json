    "intro": "Ceanothus americanus var. glaber, commonly known as the smooth ceanothus, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and often grayish-green in appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and erosion control in arid regions."
