    "intro": "Carex inflata var. anticostensis, commonly known as the Anticosti sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern regions of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering heads, which appear in late summer, consist of small, clustered spikelets that produce wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in wetland habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
