    "intro": "Canarium ramosii var. parvum, commonly known as the small-leaf candlenut, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing a single seed. Its botanical features make it distinct from other canarium species, particularly in leaf size and fruit morphology. It is often found in lowland rainforests and thrives in humid, warm climates."
