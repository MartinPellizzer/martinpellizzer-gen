    "intro": "Chamaecyparis boursieri lutescens, commonly known as the golden cypress, is a species of evergreen conifer native to western Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts with its bluish-green stems. The plant has a compact, conical shape and produces small, scale-like leaves arranged in crossed pairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
