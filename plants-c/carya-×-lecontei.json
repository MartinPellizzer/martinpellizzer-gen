    "intro": "Carya \u00d7 lecontei, commonly known as the Nuttall hickory, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the shellbark hickory (Carya ovata) and the bitternut hickory (Carya cordiformis). It is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The tree produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which mature in the fall. Its flowers are dioecious, with separate male and female plants, and it relies on wind pollination. The species is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
