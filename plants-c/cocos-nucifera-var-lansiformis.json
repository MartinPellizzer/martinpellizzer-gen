    "intro": "Cocos nucifera var. lansiformis, commonly known as the broad-leaf coconut. This variant of the coconut palm is characterized by its wide, fan-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. It is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces coconuts that are similar to the common coconut but may have slightly different growth patterns. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as for coconut production."
