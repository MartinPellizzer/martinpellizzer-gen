    "intro": "Cleisostoma roseum, commonly known as the rose-flowered cleistostoma, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or rose-colored, with a unique structure that resembles a closed bud. The plant produces small, greenish-white sepals and petals, which are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cleisostoma roseum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
