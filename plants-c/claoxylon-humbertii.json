    "intro": "Claoxylon humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's claoxylon, is a rare and endangered tree species native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Claoxylinaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is critically threatened with extinction, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
