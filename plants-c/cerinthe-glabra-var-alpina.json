    "intro": "Cerinthe glabra var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine cerinthe, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in high-altitude ecosystems."
