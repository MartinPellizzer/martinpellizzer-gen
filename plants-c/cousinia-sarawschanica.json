    "intro": "Cousinia sarawschanica, commonly known as the Kashmir carnation, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, pink to purple flower heads. The plant produces numerous small, tubular flowers arranged in a dense cluster, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in its arid habitat. Cousinia sarawschanica is often cultivated for its ornamental value in rock gardens and alpine settings."
