    "intro": "Clidemia attenuata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false mallow, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has hairy, ovate leaves with a velvety texture, and its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white in color. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Clidemia attenuata is often found in disturbed habitats and can be invasive in some regions."
