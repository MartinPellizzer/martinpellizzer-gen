It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky areas. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds.
