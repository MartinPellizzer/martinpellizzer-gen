    "intro": "Cyathella formosana, commonly known as the Formosa Cyathella, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Taiwan. It belongs to the family Cyathaceae and is characterized by its unique, cup-shaped inflorescence known as a cyathium. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered within the cyathium, which serves as a structure to attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
