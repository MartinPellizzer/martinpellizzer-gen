    "intro": "Cheilanthes palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's rockcap, is a species of fern found primarily in arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant has thick, leathery fronds that are adapted to retain moisture in dry environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it typically grows on rocky outcrops or in crevices. Cheilanthes palmeri is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
