It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets arranged in dense clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or wetlands. It has small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats."
