    "intro": "Cactus texanus, commonly known as the Texas cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Texas and New Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a rounded body covered in small, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert environments. Due to its hardiness and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
