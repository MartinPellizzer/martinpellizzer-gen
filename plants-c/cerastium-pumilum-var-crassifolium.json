    "intro": "Cerastium pumilum var. crassifolium, commonly known as the thick-leaved mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are broader and thicker than those of the typical Cerastium pumilum, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover in gardens and natural habitats."
