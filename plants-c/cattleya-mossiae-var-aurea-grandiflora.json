    "intro": "Cattleya mossiae var. aurea-grandiflora, commonly known as the golden grandiflora Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid prized for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms. It features large, showy flowers with a striking yellow coloration and a white or pink throat, often with intricate markings. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on trees rather than in soil, and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. It produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in tropical climates. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
