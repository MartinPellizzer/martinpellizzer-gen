    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia subvar. tenuissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The leaves are round and often hairy, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This subvariety is adapted to grow in moist, well-drained soils, often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and naturalized landscapes."
