It is characterized by its striking, often variegated leaves and its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant prefers cool, shaded environments and well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its flowers are usually pale pink or white with a distinctive yellowish throat, and it produces small, dark brown seeds.
