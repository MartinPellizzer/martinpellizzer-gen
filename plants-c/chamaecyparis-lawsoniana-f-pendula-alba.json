    "intro": "Chamaecyparis lawsoniana f. pendula-alba, commonly known as the white weeping cedar, is a unique cultivar of the Lawson cypress. It is characterized by its cascading, weeping growth habit with long, drooping branches that create a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are typically a soft green, though the 'alba' form may exhibit a lighter, almost white hue. This cultivar is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is relatively slow-growing and requires well-drained soil and partial to full sun for optimal growth."
