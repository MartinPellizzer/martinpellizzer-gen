    "intro": "Caribea, commonly known as the Caribbean cherry, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, bright red fruits that are rich in vitamin C. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its flowers are fragrant and white, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The fruit, while edible, is typically used in jams, juices, and traditional medicine due to its high antioxidant content."
