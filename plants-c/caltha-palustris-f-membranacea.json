    "intro": "Caltha palustris f. membranacea, commonly known as the membranaceous marsh marigold, is a variant of the marsh marigold native to wetland habitats in northern regions. It is characterized by its delicate, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically broader and more rounded compared to the typical form, with a waxy, membranous texture. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along stream edges. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant for wetland gardens and conservation efforts."
