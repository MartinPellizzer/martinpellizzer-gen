    "intro": "Cyclamen repandum var. rhodense, commonly known as the pink cyclamen, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety foliage and clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental in gardens and indoor settings. Its tuberous roots allow it to survive harsh winter conditions, and it thrives in partial shade with well-drained soil. Cyclamen repandum var. rhodense is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ability to bloom during the colder months."
