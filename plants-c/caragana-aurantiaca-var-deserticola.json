    "intro": "Caragana aurantiaca var. deserticola, commonly known as the desert pea or yellow peashrub, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its yellow pea-like flowers and compound leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and steppe environments. Due to its hardiness, it is used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes."
