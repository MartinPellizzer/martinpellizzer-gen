    "intro": "Carex vesicaria var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf bur-reed, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces cylindrical spikes of small, greenish-brown flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
