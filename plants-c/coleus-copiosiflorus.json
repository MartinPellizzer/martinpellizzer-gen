    "intro": "Coleus copiosiflorus, commonly known as the profuse-flowered coleus, is a tropical perennial native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy bracts that range in color from red to purple, often mistaken for flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture and a variety of shades, from deep green to variegated patterns. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This ornamental plant is popular in gardens and as a houseplant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
