    "intro": "Calamagrostis hirta, commonly known as the hairy reed, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often along riverbanks and in wet meadows. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or pink hues. Calamagrostis hirta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
