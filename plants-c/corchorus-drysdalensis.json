    "intro": "Corchorus drysdalensis, commonly known as the Namib Desert spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the brief rainy season. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it has a deep root system to access underground moisture. This species is an important part of the desert ecosystem, providing habitat and food for local wildlife."
