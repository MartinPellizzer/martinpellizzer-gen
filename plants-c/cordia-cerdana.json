    "intro": "Cordia cerdana, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by fleshy, red berries that contain several seeds. Its roots form a dense network that stabilizes coastal soils and prevents erosion. Cordia cerdana is an important species in mangrove ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
