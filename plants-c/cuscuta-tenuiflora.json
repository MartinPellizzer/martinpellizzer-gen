    "intro": "Cuscuta tenuiflora, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves attaching to host plants through haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant is often found on various agricultural crops and weeds, making it a significant agricultural pest. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its widespread distribution. Cuscuta tenuiflora is an example of a holoparasite, meaning it derives all its nutrients from its host."
