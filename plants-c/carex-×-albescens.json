It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with a silvery-white underside on the leaves, giving it its common name. This plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are usually wind-pollinated.
