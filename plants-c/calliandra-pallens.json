    "intro": "Calliandra pallens, commonly known as the white calliandra, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, feathery inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, delicate leaflets, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. Calliandra pallens is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
