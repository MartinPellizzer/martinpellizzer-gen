    "intro": "Carpinus faginea, commonly known as the hornbeam or European hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its dense, smooth, gray bark and oval, glossy leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by edible, chestnut-like fruits that are important for wildlife. Carpinus faginea is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
