It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. Its flowering stems bear small, greenish-brown flowers that are wind-pollinated.
