    "intro": "Caralluma caudata var. fusca, commonly known as the black-tailed nightshade, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, branching stems and small, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is a notable species in its native habitat."
