    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum melanoglossum, commonly known as the black-tongued orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black petals and sepals, which give it its distinctive common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are small but numerous, often arranged in dense clusters that add to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
