    "intro": "Cheilanthes subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and rocky environments in North America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant has small, lanceolate leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is often found growing on exposed rock faces or in crevices. Due to its resilience and unique morphology, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
