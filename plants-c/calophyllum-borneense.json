    "intro": "Calophyllum borneense, commonly known as Bornean calophyllum, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Calophyllaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces yellowish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, orange-red fruits containing several seeds. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in local medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential economic value in sustainable forestry."
