    "intro": "Catasetum ornithorrhynchum, commonly known as the bird-beak orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spike that resembles a bird's beak, hence its common name. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a distinctive coloration, often in shades of yellow and orange. Its flowers are specialized for pollination by bees, featuring a nectar-secreting structure called a galea. Catasetum ornithorrhynchum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates for optimal growth."
