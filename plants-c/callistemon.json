    "intro": "Callistemon, commonly known as the bottlebrush plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. These shrubs are native to Australia and are characterized by their distinctive, brush-like inflorescences that resemble bottle brushes. The flowers are typically red, pink, or white, and they bloom in summer, attracting birds and insects. Callistemon species are evergreen, with lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic. They are popular in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
