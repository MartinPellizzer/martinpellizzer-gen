    "intro": "Clusia myrsinites, commonly known as the waxleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are usually a deep green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by orange or red berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying qualities. Clusia myrsinites is also valued for its use in traditional medicine in some regions."
