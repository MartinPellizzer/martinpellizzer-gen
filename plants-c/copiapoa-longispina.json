    "intro": "Copiapoa longispina, commonly known as the long-spined cactus, is a species native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems and is adapted to survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It has a slow growth rate and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Copiapoa longispina is also noted for its ability to store water in its thick stems, which helps it endure long periods of drought."
