    "intro": "Crataegus pyramidata, commonly known as the Pyramidal Hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dense clusters of white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Crataegus pyramidata is often cultivated for its winter interest and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
