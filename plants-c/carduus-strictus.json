    "intro": "Carduus strictus, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Its leaves are covered in sharp, stiff hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in treating inflammation and digestive issues."
