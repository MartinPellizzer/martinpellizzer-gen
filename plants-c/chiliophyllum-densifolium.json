    "intro": "Chiliophyllum densifolium, commonly known as the dense-leaved chili plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, aromatic leaves. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with a compact, bushy habit and a strong, spicy odor. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in umbels, which are followed by small, round fruits that contain seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, it thrives in cool, moist environments."
