    "intro": "Campanula incanescens subsp. kermanica, commonly known as the Kerman bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine, silky hairs that give the plant a distinctive, silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
