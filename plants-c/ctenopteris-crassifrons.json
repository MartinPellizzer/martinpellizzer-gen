    "intro": "Ctenopteris crassifrons, commonly known as the broad-leafed sea palm, is a species of fern native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, tree-like structure with a thick, woody trunk and large, leathery fronds. The fronds are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, fan-like arrangement. It thrives in humid, saline environments and is often found growing near the shorelines. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate salt spray and tidal conditions."
