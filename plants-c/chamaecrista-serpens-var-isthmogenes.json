    "intro": "Chamaecrista serpens var. isthmogenes, commonly known as the Isthmian burr legume, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of South America. It is characterized by its slender, climbing habit and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in clusters, followed by elongated, spiny pods that contain seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
