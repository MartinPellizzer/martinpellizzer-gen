    "intro": "Combretum virgatum, commonly known as the red sandalwood or African redwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as savannas and woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
