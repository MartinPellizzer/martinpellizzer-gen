    "intro": "Cereus pepinianus, commonly known as the night bloomer or desert nightshade, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and the ability to produce large, fragrant flowers at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, opening only during the evening and closing by dawn. Cereus pepinianus plays a role in desert ecosystems by providing nectar to nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths."
