    "intro": "Cenchrus macrocarpus, commonly known as the large-fruited lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden florets, and its seeds are encased in a rough, bristly husk. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
