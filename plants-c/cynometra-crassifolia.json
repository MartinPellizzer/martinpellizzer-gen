    "intro": "Cynometra crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, thick, and leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls of three to five. The tree produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, and the tree is valued for its hard, durable wood. Cynometra crassifolia is often found in moist lowland forests and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
