    "intro": "Cymophyllus fraserianus, commonly known as the Fraser's cymophyll, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cymophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces capsules as its fruit, which contain the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid climate to flourish. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas."
