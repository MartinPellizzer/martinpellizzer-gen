    "intro": "Crataegus mollis var. sera, commonly known as the silky crataegus, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely hairy leaves, which give it a soft, silvery appearance. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open scrublands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
