    "intro": "Cyclosorus arbuscula, commonly known as the tree fern, is a unique plant belonging to the Cyatheaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rhyzome. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. Cyclosorus arbuscula is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments. Its growth is slow, and it can live for many decades, making it a long-lived and ecologically significant species."
