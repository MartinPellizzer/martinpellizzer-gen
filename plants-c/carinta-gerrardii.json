It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant pink to purple flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which is a common feature among milkweeds. Carinta gerrardii typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and roadsides. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators, including monarch butterflies, which rely on its foliage for laying eggs."
