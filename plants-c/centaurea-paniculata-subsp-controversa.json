    "intro": "Centaurea paniculata subsp. controversa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved globeflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking, globe-shaped flower heads composed of numerous small, blue to purple ray florets. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and often aromatic. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, commonly found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more compact inflorescences compared to other members of the species."
