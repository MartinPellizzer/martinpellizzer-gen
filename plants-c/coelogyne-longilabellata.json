    "intro": "Coelogyne longilabellata, commonly known as the long-lipped orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, elongated petals and a distinctive, narrow labellum that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks in humid forest environments. Its flowers are usually fragrant and come in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often blooming during the rainy season. Coelogyne longilabellata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
