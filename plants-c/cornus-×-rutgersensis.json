    "intro": "Cornus \u00d7 rutgersensis, commonly known as the Rutgers hybrid dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is a hybrid between Cornus sericea (green cornel) and Cornus alba (red twig dogwood), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The species is notable for its striking red stems, which are particularly visible in winter, and its white or pink bract-like flowers that bloom in spring. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and has a compact, rounded form. This plant is hardy in USDA zones 4 through 8 and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
