It is a perennial herb characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, often with a yellow center. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas across Europe. Its rapid growth and extensive root system make it an invasive species in many regions."
