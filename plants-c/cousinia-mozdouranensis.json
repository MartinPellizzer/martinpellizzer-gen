    "intro": "Cousinia mozdouranensis, commonly known as the Persian cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry environment. Cousinia mozdouranensis is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
