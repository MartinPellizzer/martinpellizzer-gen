    "intro": "Calla dracontium, commonly known as the giant arum, is a striking tropical plant native to the wetlands of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to three meters in length, and its distinctive spatulate inflorescence that resembles a calla lily. The plant produces a showy, spadix surrounded by a brightly colored spathe, which serves to attract pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistently high humidity and warm temperatures. Calla dracontium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
