    "intro": "Coryphantha recurvispina, commonly known as the twisted-spine coryphantha, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green and covered with spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by cylindrical, ribbed fruits. Its adaptations include succulent stems that store water and spines that provide protection from herbivores. Coryphantha recurvispina is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to arid environments."
