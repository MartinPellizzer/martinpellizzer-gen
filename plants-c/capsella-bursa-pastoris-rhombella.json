    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris rhombella, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, alternate leaves. It produces clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, heart-shaped seed pods. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and is often found in disturbed soils, lawns, and along roadsides. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution in temperate regions."
