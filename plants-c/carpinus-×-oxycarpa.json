    "intro": "Carpinus \u00d7 oxycarpa, commonly known as the hybrid hornbeam, is a deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Carpinus betulus and Carpinus orientalis. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, winged fruits that resemble small keys, a feature shared with other hornbeam species. The leaves are typically oval with a serrated margin and turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its hardy nature and seasonal interest."
