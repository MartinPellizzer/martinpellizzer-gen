    "intro": "Corethrodendron multijugum, commonly known as the multijugum corethrodendron, is a rare and ornamental plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, fertile soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
