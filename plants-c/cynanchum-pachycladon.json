    "intro": "Cynanchum pachycladon, commonly known as the hairy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, milky sap that is toxic to some animals. The plant features opposite leaves that are often hairy, and it produces showy, yellowish flowers with a unique corona structure. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its toxicity, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
