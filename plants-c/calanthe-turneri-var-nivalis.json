    "intro": "Calanthe turneri var. nivalis, commonly known as the snow calanthe, is a perennial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous forests. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated in gardens with specific humidity and light conditions."
