It is characterized by its bright pink to red flowers, which are typically arranged in a circular pattern around a central disc. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, bract-like leaves at the base of each flower. Centaurea rosea is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun. It is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
