It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and distinctive, shield-shaped pseudobulbs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
