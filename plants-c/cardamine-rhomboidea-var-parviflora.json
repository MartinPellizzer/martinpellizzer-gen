    "intro": "Cardamine rhomboidea var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered water shield, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its basal leaves that are divided into narrow lobes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five sepals and numerous stamens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively in moist, often acidic soils. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
