    "intro": "Chamaemelum hygrophilum, commonly known as swamp sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
