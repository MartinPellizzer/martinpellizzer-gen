    "intro": "Cruckshanksia, commonly known as the golden spire plant, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of South America, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. However, it requires full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
