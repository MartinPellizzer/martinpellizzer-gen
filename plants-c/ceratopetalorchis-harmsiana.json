    "intro": "Ceratopetalorchis harmsiana, commonly known as the Harms' orchid, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its unique, hairy leaves and striking, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive in partial shade. Its flowers are borne on slender stems and are often fragrant, attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
