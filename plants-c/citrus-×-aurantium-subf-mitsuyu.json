    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 aurantium subf. mitsuyu, commonly known as the Japanese mandarin or mitsuyu, is a hybrid citrus species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its small, round, and fragrant fruits with thin, smooth skin that ranges in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, featuring glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers. Its fruit is prized for its sweet, juicy pulp and is often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The subsp. mitsuyu is notable for its cold hardiness compared to other citrus varieties, making it suitable for cultivation in cooler climates."
