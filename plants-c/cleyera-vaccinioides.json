It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen leaves that are glossy and leathery. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes."
