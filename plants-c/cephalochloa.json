    "intro": "Cephalochloa, commonly known as the \"head grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and small, narrow leaves. The plants typically have a basal rosette of leaves with a dense cluster of flowering heads at the center. Cephalochloa species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. They play a role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for various small invertebrates."
