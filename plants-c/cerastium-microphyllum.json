    "intro": "Cerastium microphyllum, commonly known as the tiny-leaved mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its compact growth habit and dense foliage make it an effective ground cover in horticultural settings. Cerastium microphyllum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
