    "intro": "Cerastium imbricatum var. laxum, commonly known as the lax creeping mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded woodland areas. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover in moist environments."
