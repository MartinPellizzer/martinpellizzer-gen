    "intro": "Cyclopteris fragilis, commonly known as the fragile water fern, is a delicate aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. The plant has finely divided, floating fronds that help it absorb sunlight for photosynthesis. Its rhizomes are thin and wiry, allowing it to spread across the substrate. Due to its fragile structure, it is often found in sheltered, still waters where it can anchor itself securely."
