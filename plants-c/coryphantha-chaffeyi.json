    "intro": "Coryphantha chaffeyi, commonly known as the Chaffey's coryphantha, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cactaceae. It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant features ribbed stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color, with spiny areoles that bear clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically red or orange when mature. Coryphantha chaffeyi is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water."
