    "intro": "Centaurea niveotomentosa, commonly known as the white-tomentose knapweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and fluffy, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has finely hairy foliage, which gives it a soft, woolly appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Centaurea niveotomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
