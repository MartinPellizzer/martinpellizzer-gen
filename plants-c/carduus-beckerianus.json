    "intro": "Carduus beckerianus, commonly known as the Becker's thistle, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and a distinctive purple to pink flower head that blooms in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has been studied for its potential in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soils and support local biodiversity."
