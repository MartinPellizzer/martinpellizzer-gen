    "intro": "Carex canescens var. persoonii, commonly known as the silver-haired sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered at the ends of its stems. This variety is distinguished by its silvery-white hairs on the stems and leaves, giving it its common name."
