    "intro": "Cardamine multijuga, commonly known as the lesser watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Cardamine multijuga is valued for its delicate flavor and is sometimes used in salads or as a garnish in culinary applications."
