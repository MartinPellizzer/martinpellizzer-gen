    "intro": "Cordia iberica, commonly known as the Spanish cordia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. Cordia iberica is often found in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and hardy species adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
