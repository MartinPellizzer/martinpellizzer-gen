It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, white flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and the plant is often found in open, sunny areas. The white-rayed variety is distinguished by its pale, almost white petals, setting it apart from other forms of Calycadenia."
