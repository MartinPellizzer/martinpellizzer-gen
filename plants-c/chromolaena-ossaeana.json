    "intro": "Chromolaena ossaeana, commonly known as crofton weed, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinct yellowish-green color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and invasive potential in disturbed habitats. Chromolaena ossaeana is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas due to its competitive nature."
