    "intro": "Ctenopteris lehmanniana, commonly known as the lehmann's cliff fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can grow up to several meters in height. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance, and they are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates."
