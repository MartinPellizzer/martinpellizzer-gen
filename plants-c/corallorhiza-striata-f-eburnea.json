    "intro": "Corallorhiza striata f. eburnea, commonly known as the white coralroot, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph. It relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive striated pattern on the petals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forests and woodlands. Due to its reliance on specific fungi and its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
