    "intro": "Cotema woodfredensis, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray leaves and delicate, fragrant blooms that appear in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology includes a sympodial growth pattern with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cotema woodfredensis is considered a vulnerable species."
