    "intro": "Carex aquatilis subsp. anguillata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 mm wide. The plant produces small, greenish to brownish flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in a dense, cylindrical inflorescence. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. This subspecies is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
