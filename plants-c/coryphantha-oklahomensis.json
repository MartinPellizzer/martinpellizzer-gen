    "intro": "Coryphantha oklahomensis, commonly known as the Oklahoma prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States, particularly Oklahoma. It is a low-growing, spineless plant with a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring, which are followed by edible, spherical fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to sandy soils. This species plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
