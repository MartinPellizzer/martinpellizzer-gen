    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia subf. brachyantha, commonly known as the broad-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of rounded, broad leaves and produces bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The flowers are clustered in racemes and bloom during the summer months. This subspecies is characterized by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Campanula rotundifolia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks."
