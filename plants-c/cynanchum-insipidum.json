    "intro": "Cynanchum insipidum, commonly known as the bitter milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to regions of Asia, including China, Russia, and Mongolia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicles containing elongated seeds. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a potentially harmful plant to handle without proper protection."
