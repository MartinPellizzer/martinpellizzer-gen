It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, hairy fruits. It thrives in shaded, wet environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its botanical features make it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
