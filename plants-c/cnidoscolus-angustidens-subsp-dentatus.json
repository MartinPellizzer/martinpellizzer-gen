    "intro": "Cnidoscolus angustidens subsp. dentatus, commonly known as the spiny leaf or arrowhead plant, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and a distinctive spiny texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, round, green fruits. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
