    "intro": "Carex digitalis var. glauca, commonly known as blue-green sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that have a distinctive blue-green hue due to the presence of a waxy coating. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for water gardens and natural landscapes."
