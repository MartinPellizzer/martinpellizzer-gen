    "intro": "Calonemorchis brevisura, commonly known as the short-sword orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white in color, with a unique, spurred structure. Calonemorchis brevisura thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation programs."
