    "intro": "Cyperus fieldingii, commonly known as the fielding's flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-sided spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems. Its flowering period usually occurs in the late summer to early autumn, and it is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils. Cyperus fieldingii is often found in the southeastern United States and is considered an indicator species for wetland habitats."
