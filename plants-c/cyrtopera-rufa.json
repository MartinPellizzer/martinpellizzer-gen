    "intro": "Cyrtopera rufa, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves with prominent red veins and its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a unique lip that is often a different color, aiding in pollination by attracting specific insects. Cyrtopera rufa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
