    "intro": "Carex muricata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and have a distinctive sharp, spiky appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are arranged in dense clusters along the stem. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
