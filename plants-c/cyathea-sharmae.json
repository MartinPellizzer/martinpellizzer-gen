    "intro": "Cyathea sharmae, commonly known as the Sharma's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, spirally arranged fronds. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern, with the fronds emerging from the top of the trunk and gradually unfurling as they mature. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments. Cyathea sharmae plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various organisms."
