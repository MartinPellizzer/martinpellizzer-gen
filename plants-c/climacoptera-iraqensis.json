    "intro": "Climacoptera iraqensis, commonly known as the Iraqi climbing cactus, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of Iraq. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its spiny, branching structure adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in the region."
