    "intro": "Cyperus cyperoides var. nossibeensis, commonly known as the Nossibe flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are often clustered at the base, with small, triangular leaves that are densely packed. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in loose clusters, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This species plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
