    "intro": "Costularia brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved costularia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. Its flowering period usually occurs in the spring, and it is often found in coastal and semi-arid environments. Costularia brevifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact growth habit."
