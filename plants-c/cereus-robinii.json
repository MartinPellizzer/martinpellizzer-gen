    "intro": "Cereus robinii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and spiny, ribbed structure, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a single night, and are followed by the development of red, fleshy fruits. Cereus robinii is well adapted to desert conditions, with a deep root system and the ability to store water in its stems."
