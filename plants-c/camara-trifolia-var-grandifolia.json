    "intro": "Camara trifolia var. grandifolia, commonly known as the largeflower nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three heart-shaped leaflets, and it produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is characterized by its erect, branching stems and is often found in woodland edges and open fields. Its berries, which are toxic to humans and animals, are typically orange-red and appear in late autumn. This variant is distinguished by its larger flowers compared to the typical Camara trifolia."
