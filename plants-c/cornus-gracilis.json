    "intro": "Cornus gracilis, commonly known as slender dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and turn vibrant shades of red in the fall. Cornus gracilis is often found in moist, woodsy areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
