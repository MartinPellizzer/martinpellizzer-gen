    "intro": "Cenchrus preslii, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, silky hairs that cover its foliage. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
