    "intro": "Cuscuta scandens subsp. cesatiana, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure that allows it to\u7f20\u7ed5 and attach to various host plants. The plant is characterized by its thread-like stems and tiny, scale-like leaves that are not photosynthetic. It is often found in agricultural fields and gardens, where it can become a nuisance to crops. Its life cycle involves producing seeds that can remain dormant in the soil for extended periods."
