    "intro": "Chrozophora peltata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by oblong, woody fruits. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many regions."
