    "intro": "Cyrtandra coccinea, commonly known as the scarlet heliconia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, including Hawaii, Tahiti, and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, brightly colored inflorescences that resemble a spiral or torch shape. The plant features elongated, waxy bracts that enclose clusters of small, tubular flowers, which are typically red or orange in color. Cyrtandra coccinea is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for tropical gardens and botanical collections."
