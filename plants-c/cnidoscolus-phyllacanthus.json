    "intro": "Cnidoscolus phyllacanthus, commonly known as the Brazilian arrowroot or giant arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that features large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant is characterized by its robust underground rhizomes, which are used as a starchy food source. Its leaves often have a slight prickly sensation due to the presence of small, sharp outgrowths. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in the understory of tropical rainforests."
