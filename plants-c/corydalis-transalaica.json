    "intro": "Corydalis transalaica, commonly known as the Transalpine Corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe and Western Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing pink to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its root system consists of tubers that store nutrients. Corydalis transalaica is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool, moist environments."
