    "intro": "Capparis stylosa, commonly known as the slender caper, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round, green berries that are edible but often used as a spice in culinary applications. Capparis stylosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in coastal areas and rocky landscapes. Its historical use dates back to ancient times, where it was valued both for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
