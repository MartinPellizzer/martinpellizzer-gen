The plant is a trailing vine that produces large, sweet, and juicy fruits with a high water content. Its flowers are typically yellow with five petals and are pollinated by insects, leading to fruit development. The fruit's skin is covered in a fine, white down that gives it a distinctive appearance. This variety is prized for its flavor and is often cultivated in warm climates for its culinary and ornamental value."
