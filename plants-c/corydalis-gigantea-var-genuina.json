    "intro": "Corydalis gigantea var. genuina, commonly known as the giant corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in cooler climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
