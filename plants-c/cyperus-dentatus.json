    "intro": "Cyperus dentatus, commonly known as the toothed flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Cyperus dentatus has small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, and it produces small, three-angled fruits. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is often found in regions with high moisture levels."
