    "intro": "Cyperus pseudobrunneus var. continentalis, commonly known as the continental flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, ditches, and pond margins. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often green or reddish in color. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense stands. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
