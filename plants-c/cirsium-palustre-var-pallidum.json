It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, often forming dense colonies. The plant features tall, spiny stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are purple to pink, arranged in a spherical cluster, and bloom from late summer to early autumn. The species is adapted to waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
