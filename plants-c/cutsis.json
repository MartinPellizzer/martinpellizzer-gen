    "intro": "Cutsis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear to shimmer in the sunlight, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, delicate white flowers that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. Its root system is highly specialized, allowing it to absorb nutrients from decaying organic matter in the forest floor. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, cutsis is considered a critically endangered species."
