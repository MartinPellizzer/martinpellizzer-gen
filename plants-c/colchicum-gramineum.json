    "intro": "Colchicum gramineum, commonly known as the meadow colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces striking, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has distinctive, grass-like leaves that are basal and linear in shape. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few days before they begin to wither."
