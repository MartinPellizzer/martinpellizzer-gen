    "intro": "Crataegus phlebodia, commonly known as the red chokecherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, featuring thorny branches and pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in spring, which are followed by red or black berries in the fall. Its berries are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
