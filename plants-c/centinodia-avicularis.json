    "intro": "Centinodia avicularis, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the deserts of North America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a rounded or globular shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Centinodia avicularis is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant."
