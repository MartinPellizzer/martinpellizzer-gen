    "intro": "Coincya monensis subsp. orophila, commonly known as the mountain water clover, is a rare and specialized aquatic plant found in high-altitude streams and springs. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged in flowing water. The plant thrives in cool, clear, and oxygen-rich environments, typically in mountainous regions. Its small, white flowers bloom in late spring, adding a subtle beauty to its aquatic habitat. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and environmental health."
