    "intro": "Cleistocactus parviflorus var. herzogianus, commonly known as the Herzog's small-flowered cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It features a short, globose stem that often remains below ground, with a few short, cylindrical above-ground stems. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the evening, a characteristic feature of its nocturnal flowering habit. It is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a sought-after species among cactus enthusiasts and botanists."
