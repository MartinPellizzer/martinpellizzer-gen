    "intro": "Combretum procursum, commonly known as the red bush willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, winged fruits. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and forest edges, and is often found in dry or semi-arid regions. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
