    "intro": "Camellia luteocalpandria, commonly known as the yellow-flowered camellia, is a rare and ornamental species native to China. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and distinctive calyx structure, which sets it apart from other camellia varieties. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a splash of color to gardens during the colder months. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
