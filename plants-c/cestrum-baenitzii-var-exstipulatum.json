    "intro": "Cestrum baenitzii var. exstipulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has simple, narrow leaves that are often mistaken for those of other nightshade species. It produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids. This variant is distinguished by the absence of stipules, which are leaf-like structures found in many other Cestrum species."
