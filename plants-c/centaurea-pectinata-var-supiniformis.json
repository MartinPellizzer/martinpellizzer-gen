    "intro": "Centaurea pectinata var. supiniformis, commonly known as the creeping centaury, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and gravelly areas. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in difficult conditions."
