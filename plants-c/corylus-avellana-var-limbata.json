    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. limbata, commonly known as the European hazel or variable hazel, is a shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, serrate leaves that are typically narrower and more elongated than those of the common hazel. The plant produces small, yellowish male catkins and female flowers in the same inflorescence, followed by edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine and cuisine."
