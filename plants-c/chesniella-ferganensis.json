    "intro": "Chesniella ferganensis, commonly known as the Fergana chesniella, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, white flowers are arranged in umbels, a common feature among members of its family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chesniella ferganensis is considered a vulnerable species."
