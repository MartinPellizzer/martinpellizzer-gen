    "intro": "Campylotheca mauiensis, commonly known as Maui's candlewood, is a unique shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, candle-like appearance, with long, narrow leaves that resemble candle wicks. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle visual interest. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in shaded, coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
