    "intro": "Caprificus oblongata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved boxwood, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate pruning."
