    "intro": "Crataegus visendiformis, commonly known as the redleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive red leaves that turn vibrant shades of red in the fall, making it a striking ornamental plant. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for birds but generally not recommended for human consumption. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with finely serrated margins, and the bark is smooth and reddish-brown when young. Crataegus visendiformis thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its seasonal color and ecological value."
