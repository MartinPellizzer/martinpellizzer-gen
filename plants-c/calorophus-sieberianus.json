It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its striking red and orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.
