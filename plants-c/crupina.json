    "intro": "Crupina, commonly known as sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky leaves and showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. Crupina species are typically found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and sandy soils, thriving in saline environments. The plant has a robust root system that helps it survive in harsh, coastal conditions. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
