    "intro": "Corallorhiza ehrenbergii, commonly known as the pink beardtongue, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for nutrients. The plant has a slender, branching stem with showy, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which provide the necessary organic compounds. The species is often found in moist, shaded woodlands, where it thrives in the understory vegetation."
