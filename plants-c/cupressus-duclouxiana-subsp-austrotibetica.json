    "intro": "[WRONG START] Cupressus duclouxiana subsp. austrotibetana, commonly known as the Tibetan Chinese fir, is a rare and endemic coniferous species native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and western Sichuan in China. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and dark green, needle-like foliage. The plant typically grows in cool, moist mountainous environments, often at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its cones are small and woody, containing winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
