    "intro": "Carex gemella, commonly known as the small-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. Native to wetlands and moist soils in North America, it thrives in environments with consistent moisture. The plant produces small, triangular seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
