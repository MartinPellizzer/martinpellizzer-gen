    "intro": "Chrysosplenium chamaedryoides, commonly known as creeping chrysosplenium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia. It features small, kidney-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common ground cover in its native habitat."
