    "intro": "Cyrtomium maximum, commonly known as the giant holly fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features compound, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens. The plant has a dense, fibrous root system that helps it thrive in moist, well-drained soil. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Cyrtomium maximum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to create a lush, green ground cover in humid environments."
