    "intro": "Calliprora lugens, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock cress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom from spring to early summer. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in alpine or arctic regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
