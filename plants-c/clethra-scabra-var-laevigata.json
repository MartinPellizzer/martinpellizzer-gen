    "intro": "Clethra scabra var. laevigata, commonly known as the smooth clethra, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically smooth and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces fragrant, white, clustered flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy floral display."
