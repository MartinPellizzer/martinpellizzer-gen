It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and striking red or orange bottlebrush-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal regions. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. The subspecies seminudus is distinguished by its more reduced leaf structure compared to other subspecies of Calothamnus."
