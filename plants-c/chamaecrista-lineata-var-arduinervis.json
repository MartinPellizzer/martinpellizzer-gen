It is characterized by its slender, climbing habit and trifoliate leaves with finely serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, spiny pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
