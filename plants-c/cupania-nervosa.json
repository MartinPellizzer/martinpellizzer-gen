    "intro": "Cupania nervosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Brazilian cherry, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, hard seeds. Cupania nervosa is often found in disturbed areas and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
