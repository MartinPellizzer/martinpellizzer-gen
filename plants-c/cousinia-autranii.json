    "intro": "Cousinia autranii, commonly known as the Armenian hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear yellow composite flowers with ray florets. It thrives in dry, rocky, and arid environments, often found in alpine and steppe habitats. Cousinia autranii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy and drought-tolerant nature."
