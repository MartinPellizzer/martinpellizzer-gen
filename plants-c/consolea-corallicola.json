    "intro": "Consolea corallicola, commonly known as the coral coral or coral cactus, is a species of cactus native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by bright red fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with plenty of sunlight. Consolea corallicola is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
