    "intro": "Cotoneaster conspicuus var. argenteus, commonly known as the silver cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive silvery-white undersides on the leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are typically eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its attractive foliage and winter interest make it a valuable addition to gardens and landscapes."
