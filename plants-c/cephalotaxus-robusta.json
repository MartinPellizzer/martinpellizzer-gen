    "intro": "Cephalotaxus robusta, commonly known as the Chinese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to China. It features a conical shape with dense, dark green foliage that remains throughout the year. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against environmental stress. Cephalotaxus robusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a hedge."
