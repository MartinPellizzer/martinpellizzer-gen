    "intro": "Cheilanthes argentea var. sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur frilled fern, is a rare and unique species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, frilled fronds that display a pale yellow to sulfur-yellow coloration, especially when dried. The plant thrives in arid and rocky environments, often growing on limestone or in crevices. It has a short, creeping rhizome and produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
