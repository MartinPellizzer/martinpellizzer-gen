    "intro": "Crataegus alpina, commonly known as the alpine hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky soils and alpine environments, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins, and it is often found in open, sunny habitats. Crataegus alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential cardiovascular benefits."
