    "intro": "Carlemannia tetragona var. tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin four-angled grass, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its square, four-angled stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
