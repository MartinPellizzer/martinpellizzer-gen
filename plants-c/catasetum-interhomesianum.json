    "intro": "Catasetum interhomesianum, commonly known as the Orchid of the Andes, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that can range from yellow to orange and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are unique in that they have a specialized structure called a pollinia, which is used in its pollination strategy. Catasetum interhomesianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
