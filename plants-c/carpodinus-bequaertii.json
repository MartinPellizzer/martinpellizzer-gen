    "intro": "Carpodinus bequaertii, commonly known as the Bequaert's carpet grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and swampy areas. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form a dense carpet-like growth, with small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it produces small, round fruits. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
