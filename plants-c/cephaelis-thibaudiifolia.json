    "intro": "Cephaelis thibaudiifolia, commonly known as the blue-flowered cephaelis, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or woodland settings. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
