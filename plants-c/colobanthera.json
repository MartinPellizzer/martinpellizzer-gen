    "intro": "Colobanthera, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species that are native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa. These plants are characterized by their compact, bushy growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and the plants are often found growing in rocky or sandy soils. Colobanthera species are popular in rock gardens due to their hardiness and ornamental value."
