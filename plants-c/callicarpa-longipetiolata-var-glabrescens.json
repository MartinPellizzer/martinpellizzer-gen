    "intro": "Callicarpa longipetiolata var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-leaf beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically smooth and glossy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by showy, violet-purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally not palatable to humans. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
