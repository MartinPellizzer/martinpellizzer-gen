    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 orphanorum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like structure, known as a labellum, which is typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a pseudobulb and produces a single, showy flower per stem, which blooms in late spring or early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade and is often found in forested areas. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered in its native range."
