    "intro": "Cymopterus fendleri, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, where it thrives with minimal water. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss, while its stems are often sprawling or ascending. Cymopterus fendleri produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
