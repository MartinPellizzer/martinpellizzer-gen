    "intro": "Callisteris aggregata, commonly known as the desert hackberry, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. It is well adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Its ability to thrive in harsh climates makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
