    "intro": "Catasetum turbinatum, commonly known as the Turban Catasetum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers that resemble a turban, hence its common name. The plant produces a unique structure called a \"catasetum,\" which is a specialized pollen sac that is transferred during pollination. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. The flowers bloom in clusters and are known for their intricate, spurred petals and vibrant hues."
