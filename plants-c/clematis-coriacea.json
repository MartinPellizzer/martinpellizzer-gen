    "intro": "Clematis coriacea, commonly known as the rough Clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features woody stems with a rough, textured surface and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets that are serrated and slightly hairy. Clematis coriacea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types, provided it has adequate support for its climbing habit."
