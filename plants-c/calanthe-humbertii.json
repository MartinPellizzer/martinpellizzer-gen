    "intro": "Calanthe humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's calanthe, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically arranged in a raceme. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in two rows around the pseudobulbs. Calanthe humbertii thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
