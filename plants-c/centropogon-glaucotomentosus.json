    "intro": "Centropogon glaucotomentosus, commonly known as the silky centropogon, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, grayish-blue leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments and is often found in coastal areas. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. The silky centropogon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
