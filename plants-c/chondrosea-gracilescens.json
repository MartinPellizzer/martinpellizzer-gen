It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, blue or purple flowers. The plant has a short, sturdy stem with narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its saline environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline. Chondrosea gracilescens plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small marine organisms."
