It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought tolerance. Its foliage is usually gray-green, with narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Cousinia semnanensis produces small yellow flowers arranged in a single head, often surrounded by pale green or brown bracts."
