    "intro": "Cochlospermum angolense, commonly known as the African glorybower, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, featuring compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats."
