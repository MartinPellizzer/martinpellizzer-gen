    "intro": "Centaurea collina, commonly known as the Alpine cornflower, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers with yellow centers, which bloom in summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. Centaurea collina is also known for its ability to tolerate cold temperatures and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
