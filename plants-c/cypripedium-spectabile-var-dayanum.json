    "intro": "Cypripedium spectabile var. dayanum, commonly known as the Dayanum\u6753\u5170, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive greenish-yellow lip and a deep purple or reddish upper lip. The plant typically grows in cool, humid environments with partial shade, often in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
