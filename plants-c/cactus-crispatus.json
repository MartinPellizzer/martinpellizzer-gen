    "intro": "Cactus crispatus, commonly known as the brittle cactus, is a species native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green, rough texture. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss through transpiration. Cactus crispatus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
