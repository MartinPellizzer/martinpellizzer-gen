    "intro": "Callicarpa selleana, commonly known as the Chinese beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of vibrant purple to violet berries that appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is known for its ornamental value due to its showy fruit. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a smooth texture. The berries are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally not recommended for human consumption due to their tart flavor and potential bitterness."
