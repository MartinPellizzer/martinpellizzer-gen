    "intro": "Cerastium beeringianum subsp. terrae-novae, commonly known as the Labrador mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
