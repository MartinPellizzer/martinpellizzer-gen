    "intro": "Crataegus ensifera, commonly known as the leafy hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits called pomes, which are typically consumed by birds and small mammals. Crataegus ensifera is often found in open woodlands, along streambanks, and in disturbed areas. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting wildlife."
