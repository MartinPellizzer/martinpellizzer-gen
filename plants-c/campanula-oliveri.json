    "intro": "Campanula oliveri, commonly known as the Oliver's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a basal rosette. Its flowers are tubular at the base and flared at the top, with five lobes that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Campanula oliveri prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
