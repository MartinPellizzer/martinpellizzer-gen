    "intro": "Cranichis pilosissima, commonly known as the silky orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude grasslands of South America. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pale greenish-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or alpine meadows. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
