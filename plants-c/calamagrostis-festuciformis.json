    "intro": "Calamagrostis festuciformis, commonly known as the slender reed grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, slender spikes of small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and culms that are usually unbranched. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
