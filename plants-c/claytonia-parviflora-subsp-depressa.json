    "intro": "Claytonia parviflora subsp. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf spring beauty, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically features rosettes of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical structure is well adapted to avoid desiccation in its often cool and damp habitat."
