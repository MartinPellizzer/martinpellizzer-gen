    "intro": "Croton glandulosus var. hirtus, commonly known as the hairy croton, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, rough, hairy stems and leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange or red berries that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. Its growth habit is typically upright, with a branching structure that allows it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The hairy croton is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
