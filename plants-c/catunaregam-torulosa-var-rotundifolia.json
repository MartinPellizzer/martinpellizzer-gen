    "intro": "Catunaregam torulosa var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leafed catunaregam, is a member of the Acanthaceae family. It is characterized by its rounded, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
