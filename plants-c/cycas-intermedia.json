    "intro": "Cycas intermedia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycas, is a species of cycad native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green, narrow leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with the female cones being more prominent and containing the seeds. Cycas intermedia is a slow-growing plant that thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its ancient lineage and unique morphology, it is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
