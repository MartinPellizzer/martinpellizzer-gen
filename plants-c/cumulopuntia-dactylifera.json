    "intro": "Cumulopuntia dactylifera, commonly known as the giant cardon cactus, is a towering columnar cactus native to the Canary Islands. It features a thick, ribbed stem that can grow up to 20 meters in height, adapted to store water in its fleshy tissues. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its spines are modified leaves, providing protection against herbivores and reducing water loss through transpiration. The plant thrives in arid environments with well-drained soil, showcasing its resilience to extreme desert conditions."
