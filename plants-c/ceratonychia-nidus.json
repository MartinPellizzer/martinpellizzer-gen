    "intro": "Ceratonychia nidus, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped fronds that form a nest-like structure, providing a habitat for small organisms. The plant has a short, thick rhizome that anchors it to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically leathery and can grow quite large, sometimes reaching several feet in length. The bird's nest fern is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
