    "intro": "Ctenopteris deltodon, commonly known as the diamond fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into small, diamond-shaped segments, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Ctenopteris deltodon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
