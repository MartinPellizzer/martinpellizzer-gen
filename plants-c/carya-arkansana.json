    "intro": "Carya arkansana, commonly known as the black hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the walnut family (Juglandaceae) and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring, followed by edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks. Its wood is hard and durable, historically used for tool handles and furniture. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
