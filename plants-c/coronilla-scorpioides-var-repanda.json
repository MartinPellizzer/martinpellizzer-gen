    "intro": "Coronilla scorpioides var. repanda, commonly known as the broad-leaved coronilla, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features trifoliate leaves with broad, ovate leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its fibrous root system helps it establish quickly in disturbed or rocky soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
