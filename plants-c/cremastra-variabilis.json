    "intro": "Cremastra variabilis, commonly known as the variable bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Cremastra variabilis is known for its variability in flower color and leaf shape, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
