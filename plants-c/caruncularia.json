    "intro": "Caruncularia, commonly known as the \"scentless mayweed,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It consists of several species, most of which are annual herbs with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically small and yellow, arranged in composite flower heads, and they bloom from late spring to early autumn. Caruncularia species are native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. They are characterized by their lack of a strong scent, which distinguishes them from similar plants in the same family."
