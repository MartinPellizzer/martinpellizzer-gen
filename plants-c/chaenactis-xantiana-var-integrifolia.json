    "intro": "Chaenactis xantiana var. integrifolia, commonly known as the Sierra madre dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, woolly leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are typically entire, meaning they have no teeth or lobes, which is a key feature of the varietal name *integrifolia*. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
