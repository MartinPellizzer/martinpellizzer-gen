    "intro": "Crataegus scabrida var. asperifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its rough, sandpapery bark and thorny branches, which provide structural support for its dense, rounded canopy. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins and a distinctive, slightly hairy texture. It produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red to orange berries in the fall. This plant is often found in moist woodlands and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
