    "intro": "Cerastium malyi f. muravjevii, commonly known as the Siberian mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
