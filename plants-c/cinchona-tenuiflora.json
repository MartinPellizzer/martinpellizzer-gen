    "intro": "Cinchona tenuiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and compound leaves. The plant is most notable for its bark, which contains the alkaloid quinine, historically used in the treatment of malaria. It thrives in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, typically between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its medicinal importance, it is also cultivated in tropical regions for commercial quinine production."
