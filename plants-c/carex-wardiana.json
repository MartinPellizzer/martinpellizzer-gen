    "intro": "Carex wardiana, commonly known as the Ward's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant has fibrous roots and produces small, three-angled stems that are typically green or reddish in color. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
