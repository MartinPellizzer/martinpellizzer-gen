    "intro": "Cardamine bipinnata var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the hairy water crowfoot, is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Ranunculaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a dense, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a single terminal umbel, which bloom in early spring. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along streams, ponds, and wet meadows. This variety is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name."
