    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha f. ellipticifolia, commonly known as the elliptic-leaved hawthorn, is a botanical variant of the common hawthorn. It is characterized by its elliptical-shaped leaves, which are typically broader and more elongated than those of the typical species. This form is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by red berries in autumn. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
