    "intro": "Calandrinia tepperiana, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and vibrant pink or purple flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in dry environments, with small, fleshy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the afternoon, a trait that helps conserve moisture. Calandrinia tepperiana is often found in sandy soils and is a common sight in desert landscapes."
