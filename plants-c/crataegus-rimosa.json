    "intro": "Crataegus rimosa, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and small white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus rimosa is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
