    "intro": "Crataegus incilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 8 meters and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its bark is often covered in small, raised lenticels, and it is known for its hardiness in temperate climates. Crataegus incilis is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
