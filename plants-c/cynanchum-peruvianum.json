    "intro": "Cynanchum peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian milkweed, is a climbing vine native to South America. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that can be toxic, containing cardiac glycosides. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Its unique morphology and chemical composition make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous to livestock."
