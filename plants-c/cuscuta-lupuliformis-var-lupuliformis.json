    "intro": "Cuscuta lupuliformis var. lupuliformis, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread to new areas. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant growth and diversity."
