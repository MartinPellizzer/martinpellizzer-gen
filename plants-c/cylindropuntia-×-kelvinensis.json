    "intro": "Cylindropuntia \u00d7 kelvinensis, commonly known as the Kelvin's prickly pear, is a hybrid cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red or orange fruits. Its spines are relatively short and often covered in a white, powdery coating. This species is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
