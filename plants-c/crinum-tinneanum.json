    "intro": "Crinum tinneanum, commonly known as the African lily or the white crinum, is a bulbous herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features tall, straight stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces large, showy white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in umbels, often with a strong, spicy fragrance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. Crinum tinneanum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
