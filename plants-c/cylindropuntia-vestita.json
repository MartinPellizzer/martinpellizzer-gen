    "intro": "Cylindropuntia vestita, commonly known as the cholla cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, jointed stems that are covered in small, spine-like structures called glochids. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically tubular and clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along desert trails. Cylindropuntia vestita is a resilient plant adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability."
