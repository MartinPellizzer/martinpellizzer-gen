    "intro": "Cryptanthus osiris, commonly known as the firecracker plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Acanthaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is known for its vibrant, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, reaching heights of up to 30 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. Its flowers bloom in clusters, creating a striking visual effect, and it thrives in well-drained soil with bright, indirect light. Cryptanthus osiris is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
