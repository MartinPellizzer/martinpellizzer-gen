    "intro": "Cirsium lacerum, commonly known as the rough thistle, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are covered in stiff, bristly hairs, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
