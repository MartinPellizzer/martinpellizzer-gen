    "intro": "Carex riparia f. humilis, commonly known as the low marsh sedge, is a variant of the marsh sedge native to wetland environments in North America. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and its ability to thrive in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats. Carex riparia f. humilis plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
