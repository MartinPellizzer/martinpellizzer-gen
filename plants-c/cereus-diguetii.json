It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and is often cultivated for its striking, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant has sharp, cylindrical spines and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink and can reach several inches in diameter. Cereus diguetii is a popular choice for desert gardens due to its low maintenance and dramatic nighttime display."
