    "intro": "Ceterach, commonly known as rock parsley, is a hardy perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like carrots and dill. The plant is characterized by its slender, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and cliff faces. Ceterach is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its ornamental appeal in coastal gardens."
