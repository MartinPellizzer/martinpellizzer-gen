    "intro": "Cannabis sativa var. kafiristanica, commonly known as the Kafiristan cannabis, is a rare and ancient variety native to the mountainous regions of the Hindu Kush. This plant is characterized by its tall, slender stature and its ability to thrive in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. It typically produces long, narrow leaves and has a lower THC content compared to other cannabis varieties. The plant is valued for its historical and cultural significance in the region of Kafiristan. Due to its restricted habitat and limited cultivation, it is considered a botanically unique and endangered species."
