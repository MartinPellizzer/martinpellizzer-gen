These plants are characterized by their slender stems, narrow leaves, and small, spike-like inflorescences that often bear blue or purple flowers. Chardinia species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. They are drought-tolerant and have a clumping growth habit, making them suitable for ornamental landscaping. The genus includes several species, such as *Chardinia ciliata*, which is native to North America."
