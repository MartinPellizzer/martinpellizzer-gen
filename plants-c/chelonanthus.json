It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to Asia, particularly China and Southeast Asia. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, often yellow or white flowers. They produce berries that are typically red or orange when mature, containing small seeds. Chelonanthus species are often found in dry, rocky habitats and are adapted to arid conditions."
