    "intro": "Cryptocarya argentea, commonly known as silverwood or silverleaf cryptocarya, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The leaves are typically ovate or elliptical, with a leathery texture and prominent midribs. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. This plant is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
