    "intro": "Ctenophyllum adanum, commonly known as the Adanum fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Ctenophyllum adanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
