    "intro": "Carex hankaensis, commonly known as the Hanka sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. This species typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many sedges."
