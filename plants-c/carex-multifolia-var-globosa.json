    "intro": "Carex multifolia var. globosa, commonly known as the globe sedge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, globular clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, which are typically clustered in spikelets. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is a popular choice for wetland gardens and restoration projects."
