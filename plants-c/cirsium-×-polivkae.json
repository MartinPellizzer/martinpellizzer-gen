It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads that resemble those of other thistle species. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its growth habit is typically upright, with multiple branches forming a bushy structure. The plant is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
