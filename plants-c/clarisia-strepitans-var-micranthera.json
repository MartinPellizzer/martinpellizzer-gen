    "intro": "Clarisia strepitans var. micranthera, commonly known as the dwarf clarisia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces delicate, fragrant, white flowers with a slight pinkish tinge, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in container gardening or as a landscape plant in tropical climates."
