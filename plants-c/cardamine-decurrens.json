    "intro": "Cardamine decurrens, commonly known as running water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant features a basal rosette of pinnately divided, lance-shaped leaves that help it thrive in wet conditions. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and are borne on slender, hairy stalks. The species is notable for its ability to spread via runners, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and support diverse ecosystems."
