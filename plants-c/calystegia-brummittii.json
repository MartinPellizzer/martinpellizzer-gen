It is a trailing vine that produces trumpet-shaped flowers, typically blooming in late summer and early fall. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and is characterized by its rapid growth habit. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
