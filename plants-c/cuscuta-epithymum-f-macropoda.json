    "intro": "Cuscuta epithymum f. macropoda, commonly known as the giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. The plant's stems are slender and twining, allowing it to attach to a variety of host plants. It is often found in disturbed soils and can infest crops, making it a significant agricultural weed. Its life cycle involves germinating seeds, establishing parasitic connections with host roots, and producing seeds that can remain viable in the soil for years."
