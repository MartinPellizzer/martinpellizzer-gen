    "intro": "Citrus scandens, commonly known as the climbing lemon, is a woody vine native to Southeast Asia. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are followed by round, green fruits resembling lemons. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The fruit, while edible, is typically used for its aromatic properties rather than for culinary purposes."
