    "intro": "Claoxylon caerulescens, commonly known as the blue-wood tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, bluish-gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale blue, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
