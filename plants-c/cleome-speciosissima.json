    "intro": "Cleome speciosissima, commonly known as the \"Spider Flower,\" is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, spire-like clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features heart-shaped, waxy leaves. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Cleome speciosissima is a popular choice for gardens due to its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
