    "intro": "Centrostachys fasciculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. Centrostachys fasciculata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
