    "intro": "[WRONG START] Colderia canescens var. pulchella, commonly known as the white-flowered coldenia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered white or pale pink flowers. The leaves are typically elliptical, with a hairy surface that gives the plant its \"canescens\" name, meaning \"grayish\" or \"fuzzy.\" It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some indigenous communities."
