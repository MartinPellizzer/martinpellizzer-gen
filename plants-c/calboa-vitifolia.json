    "intro": "Calboa vitifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a silvery, powdery coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often blooming in clusters. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique foliage."
