It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in coastal areas or near water bodies. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native range."
