    "intro": "Cyperus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf papyrus, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Africa. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, making it a low-growing species. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its natural environment. Cyperus pygmaeus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
