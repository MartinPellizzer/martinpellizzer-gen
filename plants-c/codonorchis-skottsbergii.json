    "intro": "Codonorchis skottsbergii, commonly known as the Skottsberg's beardtongue, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late spring. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its orchid family traits include specialized roots and a unique reproductive system involving mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in many areas."
