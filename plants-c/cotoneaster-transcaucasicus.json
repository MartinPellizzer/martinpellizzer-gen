    "intro": "Cotoneaster transcaucasicus, commonly known as the Transcaucasian cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the Caucasus region. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by red-orange berries that are attractive to birds. Its woody stems are covered in small thorns, which provide some defense against herbivores. Cotoneaster transcaucasicus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
