    "intro": "Crocus neapolitanus, commonly known as the Neapolitan crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a distinctive purple or violet tint at the base. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, growing from the base of the plant. The Neapolitan crocus thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
