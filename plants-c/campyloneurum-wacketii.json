    "intro": "Campyloneurum wacketii, commonly known as the Wackett's shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive, compact rosette of shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. This species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
