    "intro": "Codonoboea vulcanica, commonly known as the Volcanic Codonopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep red. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, silky hair, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Codonoboea vulcanica is considered a species of conservation concern."
