    "intro": "Carex stellulata var. omiana, commonly known as the star sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to aquatic environments."
