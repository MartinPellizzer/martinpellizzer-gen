It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swamps and floodplains, where it thrives in saturated soil conditions. Its flowering spikes are usually small and inconspicuous, producing tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. Cyperus amblyleptos plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
