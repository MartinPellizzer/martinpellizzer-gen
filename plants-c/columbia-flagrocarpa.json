    "intro": "Columbia flagrocarpa, commonly known as the Pacific silver fir, is a tall evergreen conifer native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its silver-blue needles and a conical shape that can reach heights of up to 100 meters. The tree produces cones that hang from branches, containing seeds surrounded by a papery wing. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing some resistance to forest fires. This species plays an important role in the ecosystems of mountainous regions, offering habitat and food for various wildlife species."
