    "intro": "Cornus circinata, commonly known as the hooked dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, whorled arrangement of leaves, which give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers in late spring, followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. Cornus circinata thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
