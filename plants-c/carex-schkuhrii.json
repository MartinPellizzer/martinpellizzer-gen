    "intro": "Carex schkuhrii, commonly known as the Schkuhrii sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra or wet meadow habitats. The plant produces dense clusters of grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in its harsh environment. Carex schkuhrii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in cold climate ecosystems."
