    "intro": "Cinnamomum celebicum, commonly known as Sunda cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces dark brown, aromatic bark that is used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Its essential oils contain compounds like cinnamaldehyde, which contribute to its distinctive fragrance. Due to its limited natural range and habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species."
