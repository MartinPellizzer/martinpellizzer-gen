    "intro": "Carex phalaroides var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, spike-like flowers that are typically green to brown in color. The plant thrives in full to partial sun and requires consistent moisture, making it a common sight in marshy areas and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species. The elongated sedge is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to wet environments."
