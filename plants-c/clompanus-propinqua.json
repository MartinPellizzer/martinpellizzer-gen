    "intro": "Clompanus propinqua, commonly known as the rare mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy texture, and its most distinguishing characteristic is its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are lanceolate, with a rough, serrated margin, and the plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, Clompanus propinqua is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
