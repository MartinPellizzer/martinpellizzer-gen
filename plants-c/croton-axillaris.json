    "intro": "Croton axillaris, commonly known as the silver croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or silver hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Croton axillaris is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant foliage and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
