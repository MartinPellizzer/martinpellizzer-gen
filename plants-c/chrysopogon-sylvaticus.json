    "intro": "Chrysopogon sylvaticus, commonly known as the mountain grass or wild oatgrass, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia and the Americas. It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-green hue. Chrysopogon sylvaticus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
