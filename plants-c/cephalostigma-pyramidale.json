    "intro": "Cephalostigma pyramidale, commonly known as the pyramidale bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots. The species is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems."
