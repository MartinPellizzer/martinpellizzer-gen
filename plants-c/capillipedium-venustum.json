    "intro": "Capillipedium venustum, commonly known as the golden thread orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves and striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific conditions to flourish, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Capillipedium venustum is considered endangered in its natural range."
