    "intro": "Chondrorhyncha anatona, commonly known as the Atlantic sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the North Atlantic. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny bracts that enclose its small, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in saline environments, such as salt marshes and dunes, and has adapted to tolerate high levels of salt and wind. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, helping to store water in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils."
