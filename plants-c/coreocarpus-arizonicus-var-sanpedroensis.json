    "intro": "Coreocarpus arizonicus var. sanpedroensis, commonly known as San Pedro prickly pear, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces edible fruit, which is typically pear-shaped and covered in small spines. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in arid environments. The plant's structure and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in desert and semi-arid climates."
