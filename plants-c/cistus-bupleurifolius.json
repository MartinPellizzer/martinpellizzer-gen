    "intro": "Cistus bupleurifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cistus bupleurifolius is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
