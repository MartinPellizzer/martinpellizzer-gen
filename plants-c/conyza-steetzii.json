    "intro": "Conyza steetzii, commonly known as the Steetz's weed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is an annual herb that grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Conyza steetzii is often considered a weed but has ecological significance in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
