It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
