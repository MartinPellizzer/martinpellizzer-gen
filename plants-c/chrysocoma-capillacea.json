    "intro": "Chrysocoma capillacea, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil and withstand drought. Chrysocoma capillacea is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fuelwood."
