    "intro": "Cerastium trigynum f. tetragynum, commonly known as the four-ovary chickweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has opposite, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are prostrate, spreading along the ground. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its four ovary chambers, which set it apart from the typical three-ovary form of Cerastium trigynum."
