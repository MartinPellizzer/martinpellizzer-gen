It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a dense layer of dead fronds that give it a metallic sheen. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Cyathea aeneifolia is valued for its ornamental appearance and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
