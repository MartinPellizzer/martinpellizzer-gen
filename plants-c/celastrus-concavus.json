    "intro": "Celastrus concavus, commonly known as the concave staff-vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries containing seeds. Its botanical features include a distinctive concave shape on the inner surface of its stem, which gives it its common name. It is often found in humid, lowland forests and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
