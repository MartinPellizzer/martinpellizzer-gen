    "intro": "Carex roalsoniana, commonly known as Roalson's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, consist of small, greenish-brown flowers that are wind-pollinated. Roalson's sedge plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing soil."
