    "intro": "Cycnogeton dubium, commonly known as the water thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often found along the edges of lakes, ponds, and rivers. The plant has striking blue to purple flower heads that resemble thistles, with a central disc surrounded by bracts. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cycnogeton dubium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic biodiversity."
