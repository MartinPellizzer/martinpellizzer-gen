It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves and dense, grass-like growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other moist habitats. Black sedge is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
