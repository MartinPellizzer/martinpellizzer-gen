It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruits are three-winged samaras that aid in wind dispersal. Botanically, it belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both wet and dry conditions."
