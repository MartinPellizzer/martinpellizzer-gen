    "intro": "Cerinthe aspera subsp. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine Cerinthe, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects, and the plant is known for its resilience in harsh mountain environments. Cerinthe aspera subsp. alpina is often found in alpine meadows and is a characteristic species of the European alpine flora."
