    "intro": "Cinchona micrantha var. huanucensis, commonly known as the Huanuco cinchona, is a species native to the Andean regions of Peru. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and large, elliptical leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is closely related to other cinchona species, some of which are sources of quinine. This variety is of interest for its potential medicinal properties and ecological role in its native habitat."
