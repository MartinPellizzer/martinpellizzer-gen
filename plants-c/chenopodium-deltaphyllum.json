    "intro": "Chenopodium deltaphyllum, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its deltoid-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, prickly hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Chenopodium deltaphyllum is adapted to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
