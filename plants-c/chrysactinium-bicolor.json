    "intro": "Chrysactinium bicolor, commonly known as the flame violet, is a striking herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish-brown at the base and bright green at the tips. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its unique coloration and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to native plant collections."
