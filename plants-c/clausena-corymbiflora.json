    "intro": "Clausena corymbiflora, commonly known as the white carambola, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in corymbs, which are clusters of flowers with a single central flower. Its fruit, similar to a carambola, is typically yellow or orange when ripe and has a sour taste. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruit."
