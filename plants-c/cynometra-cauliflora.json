    "intro": "Cynometra cauliflora, commonly known as the tropical ash or wild tamarind, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its cauliflorous flowering pattern, where flowers and fruits develop directly on the trunk and branches. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, globose fruits containing edible seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine and as a source of timber."
