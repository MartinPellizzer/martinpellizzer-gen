    "intro": "Chaetogastra strigosa, commonly known as the rough-hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
