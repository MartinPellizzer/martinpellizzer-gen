It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The leaves are typically compound, with multiple leaflets arranged in pairs, and the plant produces long, cylindrical pods containing flat, winged seeds. Cassia nana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It also has traditional uses in herbal medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
