    "intro": "Costus cernuus, commonly known as the drooping costus, is a tropical perennial herb native to Central and South America. It features slender, erect stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common ornamental in warm climates. The plant is often cultivated for its attractive foliage and subtle floral display."
