    "intro": "Carex goodenowii f. leucolepis, commonly known as the white-leaved sedge, is a botanical variant of the Carex genus characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces small, spadix-like inflorescences that are surrounded by bracts, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a dense, compact growth habit. This ornamental plant is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in native plant gardens and wetland restoration projects."
