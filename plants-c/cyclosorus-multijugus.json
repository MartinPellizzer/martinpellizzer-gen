The plant has a distinctive structure with a central axis and lateral lobes, giving it a cup-like appearance. It is characterized by its simple, non-vascular anatomy and lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. Cyclosorus multijugus is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of environmental conditions."
