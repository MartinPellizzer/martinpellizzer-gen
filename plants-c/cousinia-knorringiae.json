    "intro": "Cousinia knorringiae, commonly known as the Karakoram fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it adapts to cold and arid conditions. Its narrow, grass-like leaves and small yellow to pink flowers help it conserve water and withstand harsh climates. Cousinia knorringiae plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
