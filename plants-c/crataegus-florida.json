    "intro": "Crataegus florida, commonly known as the flowering dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy white or pink bracts that surround small, yellowish flowers in the spring. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Its leaves are oval-shaped with pointed tips and turn vibrant red or orange in the autumn. Crataegus florida is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits in woodland habitats."
