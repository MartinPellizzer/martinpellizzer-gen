    "intro": "Chrysopogon borneensis, commonly known as Bornean needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the tropical regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy areas, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicle inflorescences, which are usually greenish or reddish in color. Due to its habitat preferences, it plays an important role in the ecological dynamics of its native ecosystems."
