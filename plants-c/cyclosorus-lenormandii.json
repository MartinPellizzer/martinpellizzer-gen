    "intro": "Cyclosorus lenormandii, commonly known as the Lenormand's water clover, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, fan-shaped segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, contributing to water filtration and habitat creation for microorganisms. Cyclosorus lenormandii is valued in aquatic gardening for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits."
