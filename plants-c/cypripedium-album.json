    "intro": "Cypripedium album, commonly known as the white lady's tresses, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and a dense, white or pale pink inflorescence that resembles a cascade of tiny flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in shaded forest understories. Its flowers are highly prized for their beauty and are also used in traditional medicine in some cultures. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
