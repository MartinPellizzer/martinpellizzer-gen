    "intro": "Cymbachne guineensis subvar. helophila, commonly known as the swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in dense clusters, with slender, cylindrical stems that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters near the base. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for anchoring in water-saturated soils, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. This subvariety is valued for its ability to thrive in poorly drained soils and its potential use in phytoremediation."
