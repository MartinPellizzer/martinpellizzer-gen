    "intro": "Cephalanthera rubra f. comosa, commonly known as the hairy red helleborine, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and its striking red and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, relying instead on a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. It thrives in shaded, moist woodland environments, often growing in rich, loamy soils. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in many regions."
