    "intro": "Campyloneurum leoniae, commonly known as the Leonia fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in tropical rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered in small, round clusters on the underside of its fronds. Campyloneurum leoniae is valued not only for its ornamental appearance but also for its ecological role in maintaining forest biodiversity."
