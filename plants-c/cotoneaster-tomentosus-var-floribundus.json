    "intro": "Cotoneaster tomentosus var. floribundus, commonly known as the woolly cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features dense, upright growth with grayish-white, pubescent (hairy) bark that becomes smoother with age. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that persist into winter. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a velvety texture and a bluish-green hue. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its winter interest and adaptability to various soil types."
