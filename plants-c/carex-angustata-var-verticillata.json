    "intro": "Carex angustata var. verticillata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a tight, cylindrical cluster at the base. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
