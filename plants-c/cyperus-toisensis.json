    "intro": "Cyperus toisensis, commonly known as the Toise's flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its slender, grass-like stems are usually green or reddish, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Cyperus toisensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
