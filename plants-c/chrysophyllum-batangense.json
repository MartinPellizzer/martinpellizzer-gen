It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, elliptical leaves with a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that develop into edible, yellow-orange fruits with a sweet and fragrant pulp. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and fruit yield, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and home landscapes."
