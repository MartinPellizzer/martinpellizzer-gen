    "intro": "Cinnamomum cassia subsp. pseudomelastoma, commonly known as Vietnamese cinnamon, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown bark, which is often used in traditional medicine and as a spice. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by egg-shaped, reddish berries. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a pleasant aroma when crushed. This subspecies is closely related to the cinnamon tree but is distinguished by its unique leaf shape and growth habit."
