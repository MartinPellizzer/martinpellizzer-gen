    "intro": "Calceolaria tripartita subsp. retroflexa, commonly known as the red-tongued slipper, is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, spurred petals that resemble a slipper, with the inner lip often displaying a deep red or orange hue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky habitats. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its ornamental value and unique morphology, it is cultivated in some botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of rare plants."
