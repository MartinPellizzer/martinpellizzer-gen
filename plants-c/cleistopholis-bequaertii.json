It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are usually hidden within the leaf axils, a feature typical of cleistogamous species. Its fruit is a small, smooth, spherical drupe that turns red when mature. Cleistopholis bequaertii is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, thriving in arid to semi-arid environments."
