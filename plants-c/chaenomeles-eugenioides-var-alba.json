    "intro": "Chaenomeles eugenioides var. alba, commonly known as the white flowering quince, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces showy, red or orange berries in late summer, which are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Its thick, corky bark and rugged appearance make it a hardy, long-lived plant suitable for ornamental gardening. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for hedge planting and landscape design."
