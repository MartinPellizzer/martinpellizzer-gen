    "intro": "Cirsium pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 700 to 2,000 meters. Its flowering heads are surrounded by a series of bracts, which are modified leaves that protect the central flower cluster. Cirsium pyrenaicum is often found in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and woodland edges."
