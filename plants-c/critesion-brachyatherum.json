    "intro": "Critesion brachyatherum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that grow up to 30 cm in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscaping."
