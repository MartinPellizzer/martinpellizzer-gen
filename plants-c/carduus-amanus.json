    "intro": "Carduus amanus, commonly known as the Amman thistle, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as wastelands and roadsides. It has a robust root system that allows it to survive in arid conditions, and its flowers attract various pollinators. Due to its hardy nature, it can sometimes become an invasive species in non-native regions."
