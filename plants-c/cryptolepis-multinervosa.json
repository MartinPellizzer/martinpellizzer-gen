    "intro": "Cryptolepis multinervosa, commonly known as the African snakeroot, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its branching, aromatic leaves with prominent veins, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and savanna habitats. Cryptolepis multinervosa has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimalarial properties."
