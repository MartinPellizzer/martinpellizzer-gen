    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 zaslawskiana, commonly known as the Zaslawskiana orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that combines the characteristics of Cattleya and Laelia. It is native to the highlands of South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. This plant is known for its large, fragrant, and showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, white, and red. The leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and arranged in a fan-like pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
