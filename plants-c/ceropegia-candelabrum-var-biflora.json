It is characterized by its branching, vine-like structure and the presence of small, tubular flowers that are often pink or purple in color. The plant produces clusters of flowers at the tips of its stems, which are adapted to attract specific pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural purposes."
