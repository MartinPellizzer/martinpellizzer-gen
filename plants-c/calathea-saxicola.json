    "intro": "Calathea saxicola, commonly known as the rock calathea, is a striking tropical plant native to Brazil. It features intricate, mottled leaves with a unique pattern of dark green and silver hues. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability to controlled environments. Its foliage is particularly notable for its ability to change color in response to light exposure, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty."
