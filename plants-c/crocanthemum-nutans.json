    "intro": "Crocanthemum nutans, commonly known as the nodding crocanthemum, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Crocanthemum nutans thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or along riverbanks. Its unique nodding habit, where the flower heads bend downward, is a distinguishing botanical trait."
