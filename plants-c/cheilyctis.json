    "intro": "Cheilyctis, commonly known as the false heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to South America, particularly in the Andes region. The plants are shrubs with small, often evergreen leaves and produce clusters of bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink. They are adapted to grow in acidic, well-drained soils and are often found in mountainous areas. Cheilyctis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens."
