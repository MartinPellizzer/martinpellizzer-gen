    "intro": "Cousinia pinarocephala, commonly known as the Kashmir wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces showy, bright yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cousinia pinarocephala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
