    "intro": "Cunila fasciculata, commonly known as sweet cicely, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, oval fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded halves when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Cunila fasciculata is valued for its pleasant scent and historical use in herbal medicine."
