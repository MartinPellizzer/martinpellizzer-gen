    "intro": "Cirsium acaulescens, commonly known as the naked stem thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that lack the typical basal leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cirsium acaulescens is often found in rocky or grassy habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
