    "intro": "Crocus cambessedesii var. magontanus, commonly known as the Magontan crocus, is a striking bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive, spurred petal. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
