It is characterized by its prostrate or trailing growth habit and produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The leaves are heart-shaped and often covered with a sticky, glandular coating, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means."
