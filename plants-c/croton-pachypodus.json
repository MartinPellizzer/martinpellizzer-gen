    "intro": "Croton pachypodus, commonly known as the woolly croton, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in dense, woolly hairs, giving it a unique and textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by ornamental, orange to red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
