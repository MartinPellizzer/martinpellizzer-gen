    "intro": "Cladium ekmanii, commonly known as the Florida marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Florida and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and broad, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it well adapted to swampy and marshy environments. Its flowering spikes are usually small and inconspicuous, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Cladium ekmanii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
