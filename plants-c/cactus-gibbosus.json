    "intro": "Cactus gibbosus, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in desert environments. The plant produces small, violet flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration. Cactus gibbosus is also known for its edible fruit, which is sometimes used in traditional cuisine."
