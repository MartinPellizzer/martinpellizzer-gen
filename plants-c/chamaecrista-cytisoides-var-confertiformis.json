    "intro": "Chamaecrista cytisoides var. confertiformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf burr legume, is a perennial shrub native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, pinnate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in dry, open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
