It is characterized by its striking clusters of white, flame-like flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly serrated edge. Its small, elliptical fruits are covered in a sticky resin, which can attract various insects. Clerodendrum simplex is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a shade plant in tropical landscapes."
