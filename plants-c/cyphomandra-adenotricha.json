    "intro": "Cyphomandra adenotricha, commonly known as the rough nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, and it produces small, yellow flowers that develop into berries. Its fruits are edible when ripe but contain solanine, a toxic alkaloid, so they should be consumed with caution. The plant is often grown as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance."
