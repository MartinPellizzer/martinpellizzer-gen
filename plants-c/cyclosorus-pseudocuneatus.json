    "intro": "Cyclosorus pseudocuneatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a small aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is native to freshwater environments in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features long, thin leaves that are often divided into narrow segments, giving it a clover-like appearance. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds and marshes. Its simple structure and ability to absorb nutrients make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
