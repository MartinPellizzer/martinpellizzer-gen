    "intro": "Coleus arenicola, commonly known as the sand coleus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, where it forms dense mats. Due to its resilience and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in dry gardens and rockeries."
