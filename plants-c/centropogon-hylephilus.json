    "intro": "Centropogon hylephilus, commonly known as the mountain morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and often climb or trail along the ground. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
