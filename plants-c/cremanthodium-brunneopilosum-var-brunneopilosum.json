    "intro": "Cremanthodium brunneopilosum var. brunneopilosum, commonly known as the brown-hairy cremanthodium, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant features small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense capitula, often surrounded by pale green bracts. Its leaves are typically hairy and covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This species is adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in alpine meadows."
