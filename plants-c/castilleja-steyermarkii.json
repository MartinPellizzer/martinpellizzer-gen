    "intro": "Castilleja steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, red-orange inflorescences that resemble a paintbrush. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on host plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, often in association with grasses and shrubs. Castilleja steyermarkii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
