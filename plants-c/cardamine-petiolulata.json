    "intro": "Cardamine petiolulata, commonly known as the slender watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like buttercups and lilies. The plant has delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating in water, aiding in its aquatic adaptation. Its flowers are small and white, typically appearing in clusters, and it produces tiny, capsule-like fruits. Cardamine petiolulata is often found in streamside habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
