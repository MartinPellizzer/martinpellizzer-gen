    "intro": "Cleistanthus perakensis, commonly known as the Borneo ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to termites. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape with a smooth margin. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody fruits containing kidney-shaped seeds. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
