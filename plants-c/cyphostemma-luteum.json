It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in savanna and woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in arid gardens."
