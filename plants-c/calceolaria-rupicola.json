    "intro": "Calceolaria rupicola, commonly known as the rock calceolaria, is a perennial herb native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive calyx-like structures that resemble small pouches, which are used to trap rainwater for its flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually violet or purple and bloom in the spring or early summer. Calceolaria rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
