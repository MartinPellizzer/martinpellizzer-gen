    "intro": "Cestrum kohauti, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and glossy, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds and bats due to their shape and color. Cestrum kohauti is also known for its showy, red or orange berries that follow the flowers."
