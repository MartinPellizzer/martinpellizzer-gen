    "intro": "Centaurea bovina, commonly known as the cattle thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its leaves are often covered in a white, powdery coating called bloom, which helps reduce water loss. Centaurea bovina is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in herbal remedies."
