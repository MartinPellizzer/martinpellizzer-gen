    "intro": "Cactus prolifer, commonly known as the jumping cholla, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, branching stems that can grow up to 15 feet in length. The plant stores water in its fleshy stems, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its small, green flowers bloom in the spring, often in shades of yellow or white. The plant's unique structure enables it to propagate through vegetative growth, as its segments can take root and grow into new plants when they detach."
