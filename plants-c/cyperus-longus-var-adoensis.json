    "intro": "Cyperus longus var. adoensis, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The species is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
