    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis glauca var. kuyuensis, commonly known as the Kuyu ironwood, is a rare and hardy tree species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark-brown to blackish bark and evergreen, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing single seeds. It is valued for its exceptionally durable wood, which is resistant to decay and insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its natural range."
