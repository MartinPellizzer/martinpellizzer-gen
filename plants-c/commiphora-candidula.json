    "intro": "Commiphora candidula, commonly known as white myrrh, is a small evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes other resin-producing plants. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and small, leathery leaves. It produces a pale yellow resin that is harvested from the bark, which has been used traditionally for medicinal and aromatic purposes. The plant's ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions makes it an important component of its ecosystem."
