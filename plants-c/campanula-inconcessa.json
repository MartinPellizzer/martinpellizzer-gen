    "intro": "Campanula inconcessa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
