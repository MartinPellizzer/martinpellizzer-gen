    "intro": "Chrysobalanus, commonly known as the wax apple or yellow mangosteen, is a tropical genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It includes several species, with Chrysobalanus icaco being the most well-known, native to the Americas. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, small white or pink flowers, and edible, citrus-like fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. The fruit's outer skin, or pericarp, is typically covered in a waxy coating, which gives it its common name. Chrysobalanus species are often found in coastal areas and are valued for their ornamental and medicinal properties."
