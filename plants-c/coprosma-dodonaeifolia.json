    "intro": "Coprosma dodonaeifolia, commonly known as the silver coprosma, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, dark green leaves with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for native birds. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. The species is also valued for its role in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
