    "intro": "Chevreulia acuminata, commonly known as the African candelabra tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive branching pattern, with multiple stems emerging from the base, forming a candelabra-like shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense panicles, followed by woody pods containing flat, bean-like seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
