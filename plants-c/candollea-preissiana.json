    "intro": "Candollea preissiana, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, waxy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens in dry climates."
