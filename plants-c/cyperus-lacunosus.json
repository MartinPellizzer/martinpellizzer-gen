    "intro": "Cyperus lacunosus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like stems and distinctive, umbrella-shaped inflorescences that consist of numerous small, triangular spikelets. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight waxy coating, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Cyperus lacunosus is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to various water conditions."
