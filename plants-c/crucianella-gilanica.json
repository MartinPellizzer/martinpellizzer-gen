It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, simple leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often near water bodies. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
