    "intro": "Corispermum lepidocarpum var. kokonoricum, commonly known as the Kokonori sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of northern Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in dry, hard capsules, a feature typical of the Chenopodiaceae family. The Kokonori sandmat is adapted to harsh environments, with mechanisms to conserve water and withstand high temperatures."
