    "intro": "Carpolepis laurifolia, commonly known as the laurel-leaved carpolepis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that resemble those of laurel plants. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruits are small, woody capsules that contain several seeds. Carpolepis laurifolia is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
