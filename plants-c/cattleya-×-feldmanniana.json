It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in environments with seasonal droughts. Its leaves are usually dark green and strap-like, and it blooms during the warmer months. This orchid is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
