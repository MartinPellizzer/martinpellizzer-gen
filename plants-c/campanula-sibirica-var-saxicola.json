    "intro": "Campanula sibirica var. saxicola, commonly known as the saxicola bellflower, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy layer, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
