    "intro": "Cardamine yezoensis var. torrentis, commonly known as the Yezo water crowfoot, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating in shallow, fast-flowing streams. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly stream beds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
