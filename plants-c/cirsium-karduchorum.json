    "intro": "Cirsium karduchorum, commonly known as the Karduchian thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and showy purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. It has a robust root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
