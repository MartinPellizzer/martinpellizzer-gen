    "intro": "Cynometra letestui, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves with a velvety texture. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by woody, drupaceous fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local timber trade. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
