    "intro": "Ceratocephala leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-leaved ceratocephala, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spherical heads. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, with a smooth texture that gives it its common name. Ceratocephala leiocarpa is often found in fynbos vegetation, contributing to the biodiversity of its native environment."
