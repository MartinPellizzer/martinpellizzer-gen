It is characterized by its thick, smooth bark and clusters of fragrant, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, orange-red berries in the fall, which are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year."
