    "intro": "Cupaniopsis diploglottoides, commonly known as the silky gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northeastern Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, egg-shaped capsules that contain the seeds. It is typically found in rainforest or coastal scrub habitats, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
