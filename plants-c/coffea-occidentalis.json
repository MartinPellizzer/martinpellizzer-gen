    "intro": "Coffea occidentalis, commonly known as the West African coffee tree, is a species native to western Africa. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries containing two seeds, which are the coffee beans used for brewing. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its limited natural range and low genetic diversity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
