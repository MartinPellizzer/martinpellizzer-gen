    "intro": "Cyclopogon papilio, commonly known as the blue cyclopogon, is a striking bromeliad native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its vibrant blue flowers that bloom in a spiral pattern, creating a visually stunning display. The plant has a rosette-shaped leaf structure that helps it collect rainwater, which it uses for hydration and nourishment. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which aid in water retention. Cyclopogon papilio is often found in shaded, humid environments, thriving in the understory of tropical forests."
