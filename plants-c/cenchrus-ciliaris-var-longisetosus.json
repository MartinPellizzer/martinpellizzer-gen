    "intro": "Cenchrus ciliaris var. longisetosus, commonly known as Buffalo grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in low-nutrient, drought-prone soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown spikelets, and its leaves are typically narrow and hairy. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is often used in landscaping and forage production. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for erosion control and sustainable landscaping."
