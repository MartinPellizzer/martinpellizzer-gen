    "intro": "Carex elongata var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous or high-altitude environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces cylindrical spikelets that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate low nutrient conditions. This variety is often found in open habitats such as meadows, scree slopes, and rocky outcrops."
