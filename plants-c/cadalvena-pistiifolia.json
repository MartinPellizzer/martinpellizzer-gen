    "intro": "Cadalvena pistiifolia, commonly known as the desert candleplant, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the rainy season, which are followed by cylindrical, candle-like fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration. Cadalvena pistiifolia is well adapted to hot, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
