    "intro": "Calendula pumila, commonly known as the dwarf sunflower, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small sunflowers. The plant typically reaches a height of only a few inches, with hairy, narrow leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Calendula pumila is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities."
