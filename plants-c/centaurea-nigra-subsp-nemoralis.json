    "intro": "Centaurea nigra subsp. nemoralis, commonly known as black centaury, is a perennial herb native to Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear narrow, lance-shaped leaves with rough, hairy surfaces. The plant produces dark purple to black flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, preferring partial shade to full sun. Its fibrous root system and ability to tolerate various soil types make it a resilient and adaptable species."
