    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis longinux var. kanehirae, commonly known as the Kanehira's ironwood, is a rare and hardy evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Japan. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its dense, durable wood. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, edible nuts that are encased in a thick, leathery shell. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in shaded, forested environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
