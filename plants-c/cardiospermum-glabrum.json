    "intro": "Cardiospermum glabrum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or horsebean vine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that develop into distinctive, inflated fruit pods. These pods contain several kidney-shaped seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas."
