    "intro": "Calyptrostegia brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved shieldflower, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, shield-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which provide protection against herbivory and water loss. Native to South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
