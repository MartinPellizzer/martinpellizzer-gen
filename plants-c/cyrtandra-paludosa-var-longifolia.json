    "intro": "Cyrtandra paludosa var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved marsh cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers clustered in terminal inflorescences, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. It thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in freshwater habitats such as marshes and seasonally flooded forests. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
