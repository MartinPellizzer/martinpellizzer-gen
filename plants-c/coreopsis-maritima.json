    "intro": "Coreopsis maritima, commonly known as sea coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States and Canada. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the shoreline. The plant features slender stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Sea coreopsis is well adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a hardy plant in coastal environments."
