    "intro": "Calamagrostis pyramidalis, commonly known as the narrowleaf tussock grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces feathery, panicle-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other riparian habitats. Due to its attractive appearance and ability to stabilize soil, it is a popular choice for ecological landscaping."
