    "intro": "Cyrtochilum fernandezii, commonly known as the Fernandez's cyclochilum, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, often fragrant flowers that come in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without parasitizing them. Cyrtochilum fernandezii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is a subject of interest in botanical research due to its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations."
