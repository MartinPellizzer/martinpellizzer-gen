    "intro": "Coryanthes maculata var. vitrina, commonly known as the glassy spotted coryanthe, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Costa Rica and Panama. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a unique, elongated lip that resembles a hummingbird's beak. The plant produces vividly colored, often red or orange, blooms that are highly attractive to pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in the humid, shaded environments where it thrives. The species is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and its ability to bloom reliably under proper care."
