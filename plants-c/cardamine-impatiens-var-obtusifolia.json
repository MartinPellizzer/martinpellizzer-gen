    "intro": "Cardamine impatiens var. obtusifolia, commonly known as broad-leaved watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically rounded or heart-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender, hairy stalks. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland floors, often forming dense mats. Its leaves and stems are edible, with a peppery flavor similar to that of watercress."
