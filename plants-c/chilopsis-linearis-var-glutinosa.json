    "intro": "Chilopsis linearis var. glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky trumpet creeper, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its long, tubular, red to orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has slender, woody stems and opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by hummingbirds, which are attracted to its nectar. The variety 'glutinosa' is distinguished by its sticky, glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which give it its common name."
