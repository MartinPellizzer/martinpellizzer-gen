    "intro": "Cyperus schweinitzii, commonly known as swamp spikerush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in the Americas. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. Cyperus schweinitzii plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic and wetland biodiversity."
