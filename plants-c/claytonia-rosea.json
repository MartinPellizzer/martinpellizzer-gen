    "intro": "Claytonia rosea, commonly known as the pink rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep rose. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine regions. Its leaves are basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white wax. Claytonia rosea is a short-lived perennial that blooms in early spring, adding a subtle yet striking touch to its natural habitat."
