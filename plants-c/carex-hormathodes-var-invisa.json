    "intro": "Carex hormathodes var. invisa, commonly known as the velvet sedge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, with a dense, mat-forming structure that helps stabilize soil. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often hidden beneath the foliage, contributing to its ornamental value in wetland gardens."
