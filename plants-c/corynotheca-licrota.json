    "intro": "Corynotheca licrota, commonly known as the narrow-leafed corynotheca, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its small, alternate leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Corynotheca licrota is native to southern Africa and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in ecological and taxonomic research."
