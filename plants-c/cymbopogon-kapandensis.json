    "intro": "Cymbopogon kapandensis, commonly known as Kapandensis grass, is a perennial grass species native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and forest edges. It is notable for its aromatic properties, which are attributed to the presence of essential oils in its foliage. Due to its unique ecological role and potential medicinal value, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
