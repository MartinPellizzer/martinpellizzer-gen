    "intro": "Cynoctonum biflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
