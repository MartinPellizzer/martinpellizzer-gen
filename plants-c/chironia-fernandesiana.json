    "intro": "Chironia fernandesiana, commonly known as the S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the island of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 in the Gulf of Guinea. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane forests at higher elevations. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its restricted habitat and conservation status, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of protecting its natural environment."
