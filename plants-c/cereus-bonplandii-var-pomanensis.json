    "intro": "Cereus bonplandii var. pomanensis, commonly known as the Pomanensis Cereus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant is often cultivated for its striking appearance and resilience in low-maintenance gardens."
