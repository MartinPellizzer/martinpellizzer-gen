    "intro": "Couthovia urophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf couthovia, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery, velvety foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom during the cooler months. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Due to its adaptations, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
