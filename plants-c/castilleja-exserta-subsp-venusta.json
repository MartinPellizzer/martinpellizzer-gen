    "intro": "Castilleja exserta subsp. venusta, commonly known as the showy Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, tubular flowers that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host plants for nutrients, often growing on grasses and shrubs. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria that attach to the roots of its host. Castilleja exserta subsp. venusta is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe."
