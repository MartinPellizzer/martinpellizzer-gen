    "intro": "Cuscuta epithymum f. apoda, commonly known as the hairless dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is often found parasitizing grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves germinating on the surface of the host and then establishing a connection through specialized root-like structures called haustoria. Due to its lack of leaves and photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions as a parasitic species."
