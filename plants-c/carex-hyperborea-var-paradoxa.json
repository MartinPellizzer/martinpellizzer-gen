    "intro": "Carex hyperborea var. paradoxa, commonly known as the Arctic sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in cold, moist environments such as tundra and wet meadows, often growing in dense clusters. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive mats, which help stabilize fragile Arctic soils. The species is adapted to low light conditions and can tolerate permafrost, making it a key component of Arctic vegetation."
