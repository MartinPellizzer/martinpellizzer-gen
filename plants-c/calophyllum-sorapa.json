It belongs to the family Calophyllaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, orange-red fruits containing elliptical seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
