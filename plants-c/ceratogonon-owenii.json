    "intro": "Ceratogonon owenii, commonly known as the Owen's horned fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that often have a waxy coating and a serrated edge. Native to the temperate regions of South America, particularly Chile and Argentina, it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant's rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread along the forest floor. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in shaded gardens."
