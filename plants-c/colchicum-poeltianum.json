    "intro": "Colchicum poeltianum, commonly known as the Balkan autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the family Colchicaceae and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs. Its corm-like underground stem stores nutrients, allowing it to survive harsh winters. Colchicum poeltianum is valued for its ornamental beauty and has mild medicinal properties, though it is toxic if ingested."
