    "intro": "Carex glaucocarpa, commonly known as the blue-veined sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces distinctive blue-green bracts that give it its common name. Carex glaucocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland habitats."
