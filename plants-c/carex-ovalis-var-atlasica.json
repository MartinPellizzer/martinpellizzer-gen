    "intro": "Carex ovalis var. atlasica, commonly known as the Atlas sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and water features."
