    "intro": "Cyperus dipsacoides, commonly known as the spike rush, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in wetland habitats. Cyperus dipsacoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
