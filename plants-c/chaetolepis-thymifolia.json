It is characterized by its aromatic, finely divided leaves that resemble those of thyme, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
