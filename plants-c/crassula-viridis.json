    "intro": "Crassula viridis, commonly known as the Jade Plant or Green Crassula, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Crassula viridis is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
