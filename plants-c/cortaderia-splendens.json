    "intro": "Cortaderia splendens, commonly known as the fountain grass, is a striking ornamental grass native to South America. It features tall, arching clumps of slender, silver-green leaves that create a dramatic visual effect in gardens. The plant produces plume-like inflorescences that add a feathery texture, especially in the autumn and winter seasons. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and coastal gardens. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract birds and insects make it a versatile and ecologically beneficial plant."
