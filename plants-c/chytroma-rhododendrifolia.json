    "intro": "Chytroma rhododendrifolia, commonly known as the red-leaved rhododendron, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that exhibits a vibrant red hue, particularly during the cooler months. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical features include opposite, elliptical leaves and a woody stem structure typical of the Rhododendron family. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth."
