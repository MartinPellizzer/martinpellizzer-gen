    "intro": "Cytinus ruber, commonly known as the crimson sand mat, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system forms a dense mat that can cover large areas of disturbed soil. Cytinus ruber is often found in rocky or sandy environments, where it thrives in full sun."
