    "intro": "Coespeletia laxiflora, commonly known as the Andean sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Coespeletia laxiflora plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
