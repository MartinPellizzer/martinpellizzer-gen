It belongs to the Clusiaceae family, also known as the guttiferae family, and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in humid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in shaded, moist conditions and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests."
