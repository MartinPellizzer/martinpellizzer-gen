    "intro": "Cymbidium pedicellatum, commonly known as the slender cymbidium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of fragrant, lance-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Cymbidium pedicellatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
