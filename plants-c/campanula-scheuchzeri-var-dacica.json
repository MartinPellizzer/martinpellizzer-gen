    "intro": "Campanula scheuchzeri var. dacica, commonly known as the Dacian bellflower, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as mountain meadows and forest edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
