It belongs to the Elaeocarpaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins. The small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by spherical, yellowish fruits that mature in late summer. This species is often used in landscaping due to its adaptability and ornamental value. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
