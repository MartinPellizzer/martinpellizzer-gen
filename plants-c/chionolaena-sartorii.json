    "intro": "Chionolaena sartorii, commonly known as the silverleaf groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and attractive foliage."
