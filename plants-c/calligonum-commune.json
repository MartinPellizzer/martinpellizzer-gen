    "intro": "Calligonum commune, commonly known as the common calligonum, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish flowers in summer, which are clustered in terminal panicles. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant. Calligonum commune plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
