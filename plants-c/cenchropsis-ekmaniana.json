    "intro": "Cenchropsis ekmaniana, commonly known as the Ekman's cenchropsis, is a flowering plant native to the island of Socotra. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a succulent stem and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it conserve water in its arid environment. It is a rare and endemic species, found only in specific regions of Socotra, and is of interest to botanists due to its distinct morphology and ecological adaptations."
