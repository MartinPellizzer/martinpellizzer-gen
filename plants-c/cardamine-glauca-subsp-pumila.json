    "intro": "Cardamine glauca subsp. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf watercress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are typically covered in a waxy, bluish-green coating, which helps reduce water loss in its wet habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in early spring. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic properties. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter stature and more compact growth compared to other members of the Cardamine genus."
