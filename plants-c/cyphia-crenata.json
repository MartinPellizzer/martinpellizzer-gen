    "intro": "Cyphia crenata, commonly known as the waxy leaf cyphia, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats. Cyphia crenata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
