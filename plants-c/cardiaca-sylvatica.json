    "intro": "Cardiaca sylvatica, commonly known as the forest heart plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodland areas, where it thrives in the understory of deciduous forests. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters during the late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
