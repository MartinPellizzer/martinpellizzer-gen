    "intro": "Corispermum elongatum var. stellatopilosum, commonly known as the star-tufted bladdergrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, bladder-like fruits that contain seeds. The leaves are typically reduced to small scales, and the plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. It is adapted to survive in dry environments, with mechanisms to store water and reduce water loss. This variety is often found in sandy soils and is part of the Amaranthaceae family."
