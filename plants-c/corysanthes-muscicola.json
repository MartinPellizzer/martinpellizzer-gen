    "intro": "Corysanthes muscicola, commonly known as the moss orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, moss-like appearance and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on its host for support rather than soil. Its leaves are typically green and succulent, adapted to retain moisture. Corysanthes muscicola is prized in horticulture for its unique aesthetic and relatively low maintenance requirements."
