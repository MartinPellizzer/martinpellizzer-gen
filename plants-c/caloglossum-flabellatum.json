    "intro": "Caloglossum flabellatum, commonly known as the fan-winged sea anemone, is a unique marine invertebrate that belongs to the order Actinioidea. It is characterized by its translucent, fan-like structure composed of delicate, feathery tentacles that surround a central mouth. The organism lacks a true skeleton and instead relies on a flexible mesogloea for structural support. It is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates. This species plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various small marine organisms."
