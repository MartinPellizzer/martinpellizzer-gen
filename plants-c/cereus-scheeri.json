    "intro": "Cereus scheeri, commonly known as the Schaefer's cactus, is a species native to the dry regions of South America. It is a tall, columnar cactus with a smooth, pale green stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its stems are covered in sparse, white spines that provide protection from herbivores. Cereus scheeri is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
