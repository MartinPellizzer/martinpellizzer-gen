It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and marshes. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Carex uliginosa is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
