    "intro": "Clematis dioica var. tipica, commonly known as the common clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features compound leaves that are typically three to five lobes, with a serrated margin. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are twining and can grow up to 10 meters long, making it a popular choice for trellises and walls. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind."
