    "intro": "Cyclophorus longifolius, commonly known as the longleaf cyclophorus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid tropical forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
