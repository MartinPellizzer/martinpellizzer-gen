    "intro": "Coronopus squamatus, commonly known as the woolly coronopus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, grayish-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in a cluster at the ends of its stems. Its scientific name reflects its crown-like appearance and scaly texture. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in dry environments."
