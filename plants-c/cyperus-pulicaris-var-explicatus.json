    "intro": "Cyperus pulicaris var. explicatus, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a grass-like perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense stands in shallow water or damp soil. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to greenish flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively. This variant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
