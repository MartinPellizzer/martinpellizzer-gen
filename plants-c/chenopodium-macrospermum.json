    "intro": "Chenopodium macrospermum, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its rough, spiny leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Its seeds are small and oval-shaped, with a hard outer shell that aids in dispersal. Chenopodium macrospermum is also known for its edible leaves, which have a slightly tart flavor and are used in some traditional cuisines."
