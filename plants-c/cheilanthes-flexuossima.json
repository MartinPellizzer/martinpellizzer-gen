    "intro": "Cheilanthes flexuossima, commonly known as the flexuous rock fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizomes and its ability to thrive in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
