    "intro": "Cleistocactus tominensis, commonly known as the \"Tomin's close-cushion cactus,\" is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Argentina. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the evening, a unique trait among cacti. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for dry environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
