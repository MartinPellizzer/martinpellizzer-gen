    "intro": "Claoxylon barteri, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and East Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-gray bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
