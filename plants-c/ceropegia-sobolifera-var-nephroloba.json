It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the edges. The plant produces delicate, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale purple, with a unique, waxy texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care in indoor gardening."
