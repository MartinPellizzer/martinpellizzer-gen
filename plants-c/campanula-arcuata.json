    "intro": "Campanula arcuata, commonly known as the bow-shaped bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that often curve gracefully, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Campanula arcuata is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and long-lasting flowers."
