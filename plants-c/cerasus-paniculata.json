    "intro": "Cerasus paniculata, commonly known as the Japanese flowering cherry or yoshino cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its showy panicles of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn, adding to its seasonal appeal. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Cerasus paniculata is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and parks."
