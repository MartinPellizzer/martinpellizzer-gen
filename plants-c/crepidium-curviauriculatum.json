    "intro": "Crepidium curviauriculatum, commonly known as the golden ear orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow petals and sepals, which give it its common name. The plant has a slender, upright stem that typically bears a single, showy flower. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
