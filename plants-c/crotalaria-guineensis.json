    "intro": "Crotalaria guineensis, commonly known as African capsicum, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow or orange flowers. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny pod, which aids in seed dispersal. Crotalaria guineensis is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
