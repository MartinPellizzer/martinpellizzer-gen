    "intro": "Cousinia alepideae, commonly known as the Aleppo cousinia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapting well to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Cousinia alepideae is often found in mountainous areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience."
