    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 nobilis var. limonellus, commonly known as the lemon tree, is a hybrid citrus plant originating from the cross between the citron and the mandarin. It is characterized by its small, yellow, oval-shaped fruits that are typically high in vitamin C and citric acid. The plant has evergreen leaves that are glossy and dark green, with a slightly serrated margin. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The fruit is widely used in culinary, medicinal, and commercial applications due to its aromatic properties and nutritional value."
