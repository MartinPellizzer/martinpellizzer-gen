    "intro": "Cynara tuberosa, commonly known as the globe thistle, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spherical, blue or purple flower heads that resemble small globes, surrounded by spiky bracts. The plant has a rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cynara tuberosa is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soil with full sun."
