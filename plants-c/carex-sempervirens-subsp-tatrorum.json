    "intro": "Carex sempervirens subsp. tatrorum, commonly known as the Tatron Mountain sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
