    "intro": "Carex pediformis var. genuina, commonly known as the slender marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, brownish flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
