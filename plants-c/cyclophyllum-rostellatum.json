    "intro": "Cyclophyllum rostellatum, commonly known as the horned cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like appearance with a stout, unbranched stem and a crown of feathery, compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, adapted to withstand arid conditions. Cyclophyllum rostellatum is native to parts of Africa and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
