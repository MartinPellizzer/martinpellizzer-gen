    "intro": "Cattleya wittigiana f. candida, commonly known as the white-flowered Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid prized for its striking white petals and vibrant yellow lip. Native to the tropical regions of South America, this plant thrives in warm, humid environments with high light exposure. It features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in seasonal conditions. The flowers typically bloom in summer, producing a fragrant, showy display that attracts pollinators. Its compact size and ornamental value make it a popular choice for both indoor cultivation and botanical gardens."
