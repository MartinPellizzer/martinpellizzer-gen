    "intro": "Coelophragmus auriculatus, commonly known as the auriculate cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the deserts of Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow or orange flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit with ribbed stems that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Coelophragmus auriculatus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience to drought."
