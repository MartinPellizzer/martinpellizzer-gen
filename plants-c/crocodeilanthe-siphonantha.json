    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe siphonantha, commonly known as the giant staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, tree-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, giving it a striking, almost prehistoric appearance. The plant's fronds are typically divided into a central trunk-like structure and a crown of broad, shield-shaped leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Due to its size and visual impact, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
