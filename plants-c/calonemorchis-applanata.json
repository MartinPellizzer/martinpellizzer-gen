    "intro": "Calonemorchis applanata, commonly known as the flatleaf calonemorchis, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its flat, broad leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in early spring. This plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical structure is adapted for epiphytic growth, allowing it to attach to tree bark without requiring soil. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Calonemorchis applanata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
