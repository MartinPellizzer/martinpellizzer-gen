    "intro": "Cephalocereus colombianus, commonly known as the Colombian torch cactus, is a species of cactus native to Colombia. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically short-lived but emit a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The cactus is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry forest or scrubland environments."
