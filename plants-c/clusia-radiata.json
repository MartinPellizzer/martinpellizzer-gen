    "intro": "Clusia radiata, commonly known as the broadleaf glory bush, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped and have a smooth, leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by bright red or orange berries. Clusia radiata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its ability to thrive in a variety of light conditions and its tolerance to urban environments. It is also known for its ability to absorb pollutants, making it useful in environmental remediation efforts."
