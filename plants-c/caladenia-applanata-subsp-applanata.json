    "intro": "Caladenia applanata subsp. applanata, commonly known as the flat-leaf spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, strikingly colored flower with a distinctive, narrow labellum. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. It blooms during the autumn season, producing flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
