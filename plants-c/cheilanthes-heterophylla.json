    "intro": "Cheilanthes heterophylla, commonly known as the variable fern or the rock brake, is a perennial evergreen fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments due to its drought-resistant adaptations. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Cheilanthes heterophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
