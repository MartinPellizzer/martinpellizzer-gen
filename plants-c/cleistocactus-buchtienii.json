    "intro": "Cleistocactus buchtienii, commonly known as the Buchtienii cactus, is a species native to northern Argentina. It is a small, columnar cactus with ribbed stems that can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, though they are often hidden within the plant's spiny structure. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
