    "intro": "Cerasus crenata, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or dwarf cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are serrated along the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red or black berries. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowering display. Cerasus crenata is also valued in traditional medicine and as a food source for wildlife."
