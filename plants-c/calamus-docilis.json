    "intro": "Calamus docilis, commonly known as the gentle reed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. Calamus docilis produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, a feature common in many palm species. Its rhizomes are sometimes harvested for their aromatic properties and used in local medicinal practices."
