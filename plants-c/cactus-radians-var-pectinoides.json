    "intro": "Cactus radians var. pectinoides, commonly known as the Pectinoides cactus, is a unique species characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, a key adaptation for arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, spiny stems that can branch out, forming a dense, shrub-like structure. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the areoles, and bloom during the warmer months. The cactus has a slow growth rate and is often found in rocky soils with minimal rainfall. It is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
