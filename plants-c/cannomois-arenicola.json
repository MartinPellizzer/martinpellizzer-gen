    "intro": "Cannomois arenicola, commonly known as the sand canary, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often appearing in clusters. The plant thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, typically in areas with high saline content. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Cannomois arenicola plays a vital role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
