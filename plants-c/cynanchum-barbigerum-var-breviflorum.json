    "intro": "Cynanchum barbigerum var. breviflorum, commonly known as the short-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and hairy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are milky when broken, a common trait among members of the milkweed family. This variety is distinguished by its shorter floral clusters compared to other varieties of Cynanchum barbigerum."
