    "intro": "Cassia caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina cassia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often feather-like and arranged in pairs along the stem. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its pods, which develop after flowering, are long and slender, containing several seeds. Cassia caroliniana is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodlands and along streambanks."
