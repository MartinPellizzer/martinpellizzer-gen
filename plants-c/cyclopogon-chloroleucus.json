    "intro": "Cyclopogon chloroleucus, commonly known as the white-flowered cyclopogon, is a perennial herb native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that collect water, a common adaptation in tropical environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in a terminal inflorescence. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine trichomes. Cyclopogon chloroleucus is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories."
