    "intro": "Carex meridionalis, commonly known as the southern sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and pond edges. Carex meridionalis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
