    "intro": "Calligonum flavidum, commonly known as the yellow calligonum, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and gray-green foliage, which help it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant. It is often found in saline soils and is used for land stabilization in degraded areas. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
