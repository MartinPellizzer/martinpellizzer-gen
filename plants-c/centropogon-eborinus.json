It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
