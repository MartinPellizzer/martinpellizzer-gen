    "intro": "Carex arenaria var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender sand sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in width, contributing to its delicate appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets that are usually arranged in clusters along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or rocky areas. Its botanical structure makes it well-adapted to harsh, coastal conditions."
