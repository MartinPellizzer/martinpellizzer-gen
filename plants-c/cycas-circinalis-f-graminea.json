    "intro": "Cycas circinalis f. graminea, commonly known as the grass cycad, is a unique variant of the cycad family characterized by its grass-like foliage. This plant features narrow, strap-shaped leaves that give it a distinct appearance compared to typical cycads. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant has a short, stout trunk and produces cones instead of flowers. Due to its slow growth and rarity, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological significance."
