    "intro": "Cyananthus hookeri var. densus, commonly known as the dense cyananthus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its foliage consists of broad, ovate leaves with a rough texture, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
