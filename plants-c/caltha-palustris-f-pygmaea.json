    "intro": "Caltha palustris f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf marsh marigold, is a compact variant of the marsh marigold native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. Due to its delicate appearance, it is often cultivated in gardens with similar environmental conditions."
