    "intro": "Campanula pedunculata, commonly known as the bluebell bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces slender, branching stems that support its showy blossoms. Campanula pedunculata thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and rockeries. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
