It features narrow, gray-green leaves that are often hairy, and it produces showy, bell-shaped blooms that attract pollinators. Native to the mountainous regions of Europe, this cultivar is well-suited for rock gardens and dry, well-drained soils. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 cm, with a spreading habit that forms a dense ground cover. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
