    "intro": "Clusia loretensis, commonly known as the Loretto glorybower, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica and the Greater Antilles. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae, also known as the guttiferae, and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers that are typically arranged in dense inflorescences, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its often-dry native habitat. Clusia loretensis is also noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a resilient and adaptable species."
