    "intro": "Caesalpinia reticulata, commonly known as the nettle tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces bright orange or red flowers arranged in dense, feathery clusters, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its seeds are encased in hairy pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Caesalpinia reticulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
