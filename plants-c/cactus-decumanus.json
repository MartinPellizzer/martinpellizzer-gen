    "intro": "Cactus decumanus, commonly known as the decumbent cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its sprawling, low-growing habit, with stems that often lie flat on the ground. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, spiny stems. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted for water storage, enabling it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The cactus also has small, spiny areoles that can bear both flowers and later, small, round fruits."
