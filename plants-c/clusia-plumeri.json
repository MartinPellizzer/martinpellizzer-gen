    "intro": "Clusia plumeri, commonly known as the waxleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are usually dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Clusia plumeri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its tolerance for various soil types. It is also valued for its air-purifying properties and ability to absorb pollutants."
