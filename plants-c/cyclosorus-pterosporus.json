It is characterized by its floating leaves that are divided into lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Cyclosorus pterosporus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through filtration."
