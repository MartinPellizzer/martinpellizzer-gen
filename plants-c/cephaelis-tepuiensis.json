    "intro": "Cephaelis tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui cephaelis, is a flowering plant native to the tepuis of South America, particularly in Venezuela and Colombia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its striking, often showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of the tepuis. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, while its flowers are often pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cephaelis tepuiensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
