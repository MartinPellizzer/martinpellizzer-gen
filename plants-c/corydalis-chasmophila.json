    "intro": "Corydalis chasmophila, commonly known as the crevice corydalis, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and clusters of delicate, spurred flowers that bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in crevices or along cliffs, where it forms dense mats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is a rare and endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
