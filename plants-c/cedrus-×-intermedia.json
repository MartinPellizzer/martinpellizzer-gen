    "intro": "Cedrus \u00d7 intermedia, commonly known as the Atlas cedar, is a hybrid coniferous tree resulting from the cross between Cedrus atlantica and Cedrus brevifolia. It is native to the Atlas Mountains of North Africa and is characterized by its pyramidal shape and dense foliage. The tree produces scale-like leaves that are blue-green in color and are arranged in opposite pairs along the branches. It also bears small, spherical cones that release winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
