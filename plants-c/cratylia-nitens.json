It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, spiny pod, which aids in seed dispersal. Cratylia nitens is often found in dry, disturbed habitats and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
