It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive red or purple lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are long and strap-like, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Cymbidium marginatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is cultivated for both horticultural and medicinal purposes."
