It features dense, silver-gray foliage and produces clusters of small, showy white flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its aromatic leaves and flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This variety is distinguished by its pale white blooms, which contrast with the grey-green foliage."
