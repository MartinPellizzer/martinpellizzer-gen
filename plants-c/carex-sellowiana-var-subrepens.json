    "intro": "Carex sellowiana var. subrepens, commonly known as the creeping sedges, is a perennial grass-like plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often pale green to brown, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife. Its botanical features make it an important component of riparian and wetland ecosystems."
