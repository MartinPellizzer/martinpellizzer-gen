    "intro": "Crocus vernus, commonly known as the spring crocus, is a bulbous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge after the flowers. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Crocus vernus is often cultivated in gardens for its early spring blooms and its ability to naturalize over time."
