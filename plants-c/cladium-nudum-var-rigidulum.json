    "intro": "Cladium nudum var. rigidulum, commonly known as the rigid flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on slender, branching inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in shallow water or moist soil. Cladium nudum var. rigidulum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
