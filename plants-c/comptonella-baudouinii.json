It is a shrub belonging to the family Rubiaceae, characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are typically consumed by local fauna. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
