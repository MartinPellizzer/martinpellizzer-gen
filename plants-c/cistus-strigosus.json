It is characterized by its gray-green, woody stems and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has leathery, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to rocky and coastal environments.
