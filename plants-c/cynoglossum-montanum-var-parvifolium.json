    "intro": "Cynoglossum montanum var. parvifolium, commonly known as the mountain mouse-ear, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a basal rosette of hairy, rounded leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical species, hence its varietal name \"parvifolium.\" The plant produces blue or violet flowers in late summer, which are clustered in loose racemes. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
