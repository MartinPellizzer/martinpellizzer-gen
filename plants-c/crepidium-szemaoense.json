    "intro": "Crepidium szemaoense, commonly known as the Sichuan orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent white veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its morphology includes a slender rhizome and a single, erect stem with few leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
