    "intro": "Cephalotus, commonly known as the butterwort, is a genus of flowering plants native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its unique rosette-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky, waxy substance to trap small insects. The plant's name derives from the Greek words \"kephalos\" meaning head and \"tus\" meaning a plant, referring to the rounded shape of its leaves. Cephalotus species are carnivorous, using their specialized leaves to supplement their nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils. They produce small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring."
