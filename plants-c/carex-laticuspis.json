    "intro": "Carex laticuspis, commonly known as broad-spined sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in three rows. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, which is typical of sedges. Carex laticuspis is often found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
