    "intro": "Curculigo rhizophylla, commonly known as the root-leaf curculigo, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. The plant features a short rhizome with fleshy, strap-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that aids in pollination by insects. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
