It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
