    "intro": "Ceropegia viridis var. truncata, commonly known as the African violet or string of pearls, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features trailing stems with tubular, fleshy leaves that are often pale green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which are adapted for pollination by specific insects. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its compact growth habit, it is often used as a decorative plant in hanging baskets or as a trailing plant in containers."
