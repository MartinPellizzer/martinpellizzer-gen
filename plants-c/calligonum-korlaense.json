    "intro": "Calligonum korlaense, commonly known as the Korla spurge, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring or early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Calligonum korlaense plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
