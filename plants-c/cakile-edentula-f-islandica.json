    "intro": "Cakile edentula f. islandica, commonly known as the Island Sea\u706b\u7bad, is a rare and specialized plant species native to coastal regions. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
