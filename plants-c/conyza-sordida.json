    "intro": "Conyza sordida, commonly known as hoary conyza, is a flowering plant native to Africa, particularly South Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters, and it produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Conyza sordida is often considered a weed but has some medicinal uses in traditional herbal practices."
