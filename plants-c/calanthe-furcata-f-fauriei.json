    "intro": "Calanthe furcata f. fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's calanthe, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, and it is valued for its ornamental beauty in horticultural collections. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range."
