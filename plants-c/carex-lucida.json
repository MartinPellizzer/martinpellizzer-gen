    "intro": "Carex lucida, commonly known as shining sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a waxy coating, which contributes to its common name. Carex lucida is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and ability to stabilize soil."
