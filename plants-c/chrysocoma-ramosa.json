    "intro": "Chrysocoma ramosa, commonly known as the white-flowered chrysocoma, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its fibrous roots make it somewhat drought-tolerant, though it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
