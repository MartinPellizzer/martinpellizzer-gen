    "intro": "Cryptogramma melanolepis, commonly known as the black-leaved cryptogramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant is native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Cryptogramma melanolepis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices."
