    "intro": "Cypripedium callosum var. sublaeve, commonly known as the western prairie calypso, is a rare and distinctive orchid native to the central United States. It features a single, showy, pinkish-purple flower with a prominent, pouch-like lip that is often adorned with intricate markings. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, and it is characterized by its low-growing, herbaceous habit. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
