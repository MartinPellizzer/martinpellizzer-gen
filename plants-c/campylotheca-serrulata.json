    "intro": "Campylotheca serrulata, commonly known as the serrated campylotheca, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with small, elliptical leaves that have serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
