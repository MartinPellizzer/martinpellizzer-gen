    "intro": "Cnicus calcareus, commonly known as the limestone groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Cnicus calcareus is a herbaceous perennial that plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
