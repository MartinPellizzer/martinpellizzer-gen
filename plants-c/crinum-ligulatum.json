    "intro": "Crinum ligulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lily or narrow-leaved crinum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the Amaryllis family (Amaryllidaceae) and is characterized by its strap-shaped, narrow leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. Crinum ligulatum is also valued for its ability to naturalize and spread in suitable climates."
