    "intro": "Chaerophyllum roseum var. rubellum, commonly known as the red stemmed hogweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its attractive appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can spread aggressively."
