    "intro": "Crotalaria sphaerocarpa var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and spherical seed pods. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with slender, branching stems and trifoliate leaves. Its flowers are often clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The seeds are enclosed in inflated, globose pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
