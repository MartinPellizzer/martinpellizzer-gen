    "intro": "Citrus hystrix var. boholensis, commonly known as the Bohol citron, is a unique variant of the citron species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, and often twisted fruit exterior, which sets it apart from other citrus varieties. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers. Its fruit is generally smaller than the standard citron and has a thick, textured rind. This plant is valued not only for its ornamental features but also for its potential use in traditional medicine and local cuisine."
