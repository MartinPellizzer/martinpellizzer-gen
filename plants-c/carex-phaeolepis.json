    "intro": "Carex phaeolepis, commonly known as the dark-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are dark green and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in wet environments. Carex phaeolepis produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated."
