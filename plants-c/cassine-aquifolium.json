    "intro": "Cassine aquifolium, commonly known as the bay leaf tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Cassine aquifolium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are sometimes used as a substitute for bay leaves in cooking."
