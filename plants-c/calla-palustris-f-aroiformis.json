    "intro": "Calla palustris f. aroiformis, commonly known as the marsh calla or swamp arum, is a striking aquatic plant characterized by its large, white, spatulate leaves and a distinctive, hooded spathe. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in shallow, still waters. The plant is known for its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels and is often found in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers, though not showy, play a role in attracting pollinators such as beetles and flies. This variety is a popular ornamental plant in water gardens and wetland restoration projects."
