    "intro": "Cuscuta coryli, commonly known as the hazelnut dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers and relies on wind for pollination. The plant has a vine-like structure with yellow or orange stems that wrap around its host. It primarily parasitizes members of the Betulaceae family, including hazelnut trees. Its life cycle involves germinating on the surface of the host and then establishing a connection through specialized root-like structures called haustoria."
