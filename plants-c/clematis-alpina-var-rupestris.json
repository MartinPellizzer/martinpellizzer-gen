    "intro": "Clematis alpina var. rupestris, commonly known as the alpine clematis, is a deciduous climbing plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, wiry stems that can climb and twine around supports, often reaching lengths of several meters. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves, which are usually hairy and adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils."
