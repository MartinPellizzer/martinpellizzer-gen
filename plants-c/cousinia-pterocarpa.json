    "intro": "Cousinia pterocarpa, commonly known as the winged flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Cousinia pterocarpa is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in steppes and semi-deserts. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils."
