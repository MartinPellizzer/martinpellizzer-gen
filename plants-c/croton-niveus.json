    "intro": "Croton niveus, commonly known as the white croton, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often adorned with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
