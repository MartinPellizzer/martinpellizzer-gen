    "intro": "Cereus catingicola, commonly known as the Brazilian night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, funnel-shaped flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its thick, waxy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant is well-suited for cultivation in warm climates with minimal water requirements."
