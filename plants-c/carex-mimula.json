    "intro": "Carex mimula, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikes and are often overlooked. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and shaded woodland areas. Carex mimula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
