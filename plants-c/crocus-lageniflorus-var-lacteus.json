    "intro": "Crocus lageniflorus var. lacteus, commonly known as the milk crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive milky or cream-colored hue. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. The bulbs are adapted to well-drained soils and prefer full sun to partial shade."
