    "intro": "Conyza longifolia, commonly known as slenderleaf horseweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as fields and roadsides. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, white to yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine hairs, and it produces small, achene fruits with pappus for wind dispersal. Conyza longifolia is often considered a weed but has some historical use in traditional medicine."
