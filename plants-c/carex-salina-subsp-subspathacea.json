    "intro": "Carex salina subsp. subspathacea, commonly known as salt marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal wetlands. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and cylindrical flower spikes that emerge from the base of the plant. This subspecies is adapted to saline and brackish environments, often found in marshes and tidal flats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in coastal areas. The plant plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of saltwater habitats."
