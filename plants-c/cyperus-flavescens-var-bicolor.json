    "intro": "Cyperus flavescens var. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored flatsedge, is a perennial wetland plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and pale or white on the underside, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a common wetland species and a potential invasive in non-native habitats."
