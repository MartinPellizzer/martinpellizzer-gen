    "intro": "Cephalaria bojnordensis, commonly known as the Bojnord bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of northern Iran. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh, arid conditions of its habitat. Cephalaria bojnordensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
