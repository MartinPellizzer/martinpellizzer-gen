    "intro": "Carex retorta, commonly known as the twisted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often twisted or curled, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Carex retorta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
