    "intro": "Clematis apiifolia var. obtusidentata, commonly known as the blunt-toothed clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with serrated margins, often resembling those of the carrot plant, hence its species name *apiifolia*. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of white to pale blue. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Its vigorous growth habit requires support, such as trellises or fences, for optimal display."
