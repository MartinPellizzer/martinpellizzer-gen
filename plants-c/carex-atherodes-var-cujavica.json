    "intro": "Carex atherodes var. cujavica, commonly known as the velvet sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms compact clumps, with narrow, dark green leaves that have a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
