    "intro": "Clematis thalictroides, commonly known as the yellow clematis, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically yellow or white, with five petals and a distinctive, spurred structure. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its showy flowers and graceful growth habit."
