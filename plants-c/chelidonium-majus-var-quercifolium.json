    "intro": "Chelidonium majus var. quercifolium, commonly known as the oak-leaved greater celandine, is a variant of the greater celandine plant. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that resemble oak leaves, hence its common name. It produces bright yellow flowers in the spring, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. This variant is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is known for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic alkaloids."
