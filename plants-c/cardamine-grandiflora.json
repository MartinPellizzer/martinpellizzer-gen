    "intro": "Cardamine grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating on the surface of water. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to anchor in aquatic or semi-aquatic soils. Cardamine grandiflora is often found in streams, ponds, and wet meadows, where it contributes to aquatic biodiversity."
