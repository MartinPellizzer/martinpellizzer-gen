    "intro": "Clusia ternstroemioides, commonly known as the white-eyed clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Clusiaceae family, also known as the guttiferae family, and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are often overlooked but are important for pollination. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Clusia ternstroemioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
