    "intro": "Cousinia crassipes, commonly known as the thick-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and dense, basal rosettes of gray-green, thick leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in composite flower heads, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, semi-desert environments. Cousinia crassipes is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
