    "intro": "Ctenitis kinabaluensis var. kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the montane regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained, acidic soils, often growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest understories. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation and conservation. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change."
