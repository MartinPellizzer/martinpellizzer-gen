    "intro": "Chelonistele sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur tailed orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and green foliage, with striking yellow and orange flowers that resemble a tail. Native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a unique growth habit, with a short rhizome and erect, leafy stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
