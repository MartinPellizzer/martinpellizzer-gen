    "intro": "Callaeolepium, commonly known as the New Zealand fern, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in the understory of dense forests. Callaeolepium has a unique reproductive system, relying on spores rather than seeds for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
