    "intro": "Commersonia reducta, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Viscaraceae family. It typically grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in south-eastern Australia. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white, fleshy berries that contain seeds. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for native birds and insects. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plant over time."
