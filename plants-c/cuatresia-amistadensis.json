    "intro": "Cuatresia amistadensis, commonly known as the Amistad beauty, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to thrive. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often covered in a fine, silky texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cuatresia amistadensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
