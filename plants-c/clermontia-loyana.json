    "intro": "Clermontia loyana, commonly known as the Kauai spider-orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It is a herbaceous plant with slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, spider-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Clermontia loyana thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and grows at high elevations. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
