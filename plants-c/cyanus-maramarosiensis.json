    "intro": "Cyanus maramarosiensis, commonly known as the Maramaros Bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking cobalt-blue petals that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
