    "intro": "Calamagrostis decora, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking purple to pinkish flower heads that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and grassy slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that adds visual interest throughout the growing season. Calamagrostis decora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
