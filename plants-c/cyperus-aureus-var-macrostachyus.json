    "intro": "Cyperus aureus var. macrostachyus, commonly known as the broad-stalked flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like stems and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic conditions. Its leaves are linear and often covered with fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variant is notable for its adaptability to waterlogged soils and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
