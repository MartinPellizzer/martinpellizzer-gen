    "intro": "Convolvulus corsicus, commonly known as the Corsican bindweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a trailing perennial with heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped pink or purple flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and runners make it an invasive species in some regions."
