    "intro": "Carex mokkwaensis, commonly known as the Mokkwa sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or along stream banks. It produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Carex mokkwaensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
