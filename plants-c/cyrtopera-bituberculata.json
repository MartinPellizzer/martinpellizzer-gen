    "intro": "Cyrtopera bituberculata, commonly known as the two-ridge fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, tuberculate structures along the midrib. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are usually found on the underside of the fronds. Cyrtopera bituberculata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
