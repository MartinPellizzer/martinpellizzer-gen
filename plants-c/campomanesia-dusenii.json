    "intro": "Campomanesia dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's wax apple, is a small evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, yellow-orange fruits with a crisp, juicy pulp. The fruits are often consumed fresh or used in local culinary traditions, and the plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
