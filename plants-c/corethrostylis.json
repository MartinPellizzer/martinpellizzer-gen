    "intro": "Corethrostylis, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to various regions of Australia, where it thrives in diverse habitats such as heathlands and open forests. The plants are characterized by their striking, brightly colored flowers that often resemble flames, hence their common name. Corethrostylis species typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, clustered inflorescences. These orchids are often short-lived, with a life cycle that includes a period of dormancy, making them unique within the orchid family."
