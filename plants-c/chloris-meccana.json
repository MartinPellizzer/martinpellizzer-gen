    "intro": "Chloris meccana, commonly known as the meccana grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-brown flowers. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. It has a dense root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Chloris meccana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and aesthetic value."
