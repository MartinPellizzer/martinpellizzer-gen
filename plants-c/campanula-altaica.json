    "intro": "Campanula altaica, commonly known as the high mountain bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. Campanula altaica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
