    "intro": "Centaurea saharae, commonly known as the Saharan knapweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Sahara Desert. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its bright yellow flowers are often surrounded by bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. Centaurea saharae plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
