It features slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped, toothed leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical species. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and natural areas."
