    "intro": "Convolvulus catesbeianus, commonly known as the Catesby's bindweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its trailing growth habit and trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and opposite, often covered in fine hairs. The seeds are enclosed in a dry, three-lobed capsule, which aids in its dispersal by wind and animals."
