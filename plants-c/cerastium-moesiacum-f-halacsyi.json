    "intro": "Cerastium moesiacum f. halacsyi, commonly known as the Hal\u00e1csy's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographical distribution and unique morphological features compared to the typical form of Cerastium moesiacum."
