    "intro": "Chamaelea, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to the Mediterranean region and are characterized by their striking, spiky flowers that often resemble sea urchins. Chamaelea species typically grow in coastal areas, where they thrive in salty, well-drained soils. Their leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The genus includes several species, such as Chamaelea humilis, which is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
