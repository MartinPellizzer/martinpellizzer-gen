    "intro": "Cofeanthus, commonly known as the coffee bean plant, is a flowering shrub native to tropical regions. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white flowers. The plant produces berries that contain the seeds used to make coffee. These seeds, or beans, are harvested, processed, and roasted to develop the characteristic flavor. Cofeanthus thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil."
