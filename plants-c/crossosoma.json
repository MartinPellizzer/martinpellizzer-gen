    "intro": "Crossosoma, commonly known as the false hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. Crossosoma species are characterized by their showy, often colorful flowers that resemble those of hibiscus, though they are not closely related. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, and the stems are often covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. They are often grown as ornamental plants due to their vibrant flowers and attractive foliage."
