    "intro": "Coronilla scorpioides, commonly known as the scorpionweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces slender, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in poor soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
