    "intro": "Chenopodium virgatum var. minimum, commonly known as dwarf goosefoot, is a low-growing annual plant native to North America. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
