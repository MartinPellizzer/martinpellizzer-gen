    "intro": "Chirita involucellata, commonly known as the velvet leaf or velvet vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a trailing or climbing species, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Chirita involucellata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
