    "intro": "Croton pubescens, commonly known as the hairy croton, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Croton pubescens is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage, which can display a range of colors including green, red, and yellow."
