    "intro": "Columnea angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf flame flower, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular, red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white or silver hair. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Columnea angustifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural displays."
