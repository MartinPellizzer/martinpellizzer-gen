    "intro": "Calanthe lurida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain water in its humid, shaded habitat. Calanthe lurida is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists due to its endangered status and unique botanical features."
