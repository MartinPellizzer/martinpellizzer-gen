    "intro": "Carex eleusinoides var. flaccidior, commonly known as the soft-flaccid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern North America. It typically grows in wet to moist habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly folded and have a bluish-green color. It produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers in the summer, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is distinguished by its softer, more flexible leaves compared to other Carex species."
