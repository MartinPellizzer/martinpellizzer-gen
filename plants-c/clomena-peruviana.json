    "intro": "Clomena peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian orchid, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often display vibrant colors such as yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, humid conditions with well-drained soil. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from rocky soils. Clomena peruviana is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural significance in indigenous communities."
