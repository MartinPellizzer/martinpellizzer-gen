    "intro": "Cyclosorus kurzii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its fronds are usually submerged, with some leaves extending just above the water surface. Cyclosorus kurzii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling."
