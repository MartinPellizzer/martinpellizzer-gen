    "intro": "Cuscuta tineoi, commonly known as the dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is native to North America and typically grows on a variety of herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves germinating on a host and developing a haustorium to extract water and nutrients. Cuscuta tineoi is an annual species that plays a role in ecological interactions within its habitat."
