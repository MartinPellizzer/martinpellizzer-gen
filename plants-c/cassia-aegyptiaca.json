It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, silky hairs, and its clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain numerous flat, elliptical seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or rocky soils.
