    "intro": "Cineraria mollis, commonly known as the soft cineraria, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cineraria mollis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural displays."
