    "intro": "Cousinia tabrisiana, commonly known as the Tabriz cushion flower, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of silver-gray foliage, which helps it withstand harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, pinkish or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Cousinia tabrisiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in arid and semi-arid environments."
