    "intro": "Caragana hololeuca, commonly known as the white shrub bitterbrush, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 3\u20135 leaflets, and its yellow to orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry slopes. It produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Caragana hololeuca plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife in its native range."
