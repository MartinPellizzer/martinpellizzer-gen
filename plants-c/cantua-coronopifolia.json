    "intro": "Cantua coronopifolia, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations. Cantua coronopifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
