    "intro": "Cerasus laxiflora, commonly known as the Chinese wild cherry or the broad-leaved cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and lanceolate leaves that are typically pubescent underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red or orange fruits known as cherries. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant in temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
