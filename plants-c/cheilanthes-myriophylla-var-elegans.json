    "intro": "Cheilanthes myriophylla var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, often growing on cliffs or in crevices where it can access moisture from dew or rain. The plant has lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are dark green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the margins of the leaves. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
