    "intro": "Chlorocardium venenosum, commonly known as the poison arrow vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. Its toxicity is due to the presence of cardiac glycosides, which can be harmful to humans and animals. Despite its dangerous properties, it has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for its medicinal and toxic effects."
