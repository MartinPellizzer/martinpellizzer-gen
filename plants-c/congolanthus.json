The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in moisture retention. Its growth habit is typically tree-like, with a straight trunk and a broad, spreading canopy. Congolanthus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid climates."
