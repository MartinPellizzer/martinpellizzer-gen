It is a herbaceous perennial plant that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into orange or red fruits, which are edible and have a mild, peppery flavor. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant thrives in warm, humid climates. Capsicum pulchellum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of heat-sensitive pepper varieties."
