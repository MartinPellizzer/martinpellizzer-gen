    "intro": "Croton delphinianus, commonly known as the Blue Croton, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that often display vibrant shades of green, red, and purple. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiky blue or purple berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
