    "intro": "Cyphokentia macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a large, ancient plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its robust, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, spherical cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, sunny climate. Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species in both horticulture and conservation efforts."
