    "intro": "Convolvulus bonplandii, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pale purple or white, blooming in the early morning. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to harsh desert environments."
