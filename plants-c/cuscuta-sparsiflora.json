    "intro": "Cuscuta sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that begins with seed germination and attachment to a host. The plant forms a network of slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host, extracting water and nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. It is found in various habitats, including fields and gardens, where it can infest a wide range of host species. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants."
