    "intro": "Cupressus pyramidalis, commonly known as the Mexican tall cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to central Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender form and dense, pyramidal shape, with scale-like leaves arranged in crossed pairs. The tree produces small, round cones that contain seeds, and it has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The bark is reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age, adding to its visual appeal."
