    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris subf. elata, commonly known as the tall heather, is a subshrub native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils in open woodland or heathland environments. It produces small, dark purple berries that are an important food source for birds. This subspecies is notable for its taller stature compared to the typical form of Calluna vulgaris."
