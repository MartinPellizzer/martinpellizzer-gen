It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that often have a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is native to regions of North America and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. This fern-like plant is often found in rocky areas and along roadsides, where it contributes to soil stabilization."
