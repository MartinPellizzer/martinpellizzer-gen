The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features basal leaves that are oval to lance-shaped. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
