    "intro": "Calamintha acinos var. lancifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved woundwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped, with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic foliage contains essential oils, giving it a mint-like scent and making it useful in traditional herbal medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
