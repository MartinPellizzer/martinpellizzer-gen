    "intro": "Cenchrus caliculatus var. uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flower fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with a single flower per spike, which is a distinguishing feature of the varietal name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and pastures. Its botanical structure makes it adaptable to various environmental conditions, contributing to its widespread distribution."
