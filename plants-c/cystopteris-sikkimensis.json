    "intro": "Cystopteris sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices, where it can absorb humidity from the air. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Cystopteris sikkimensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stabilization and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates."
