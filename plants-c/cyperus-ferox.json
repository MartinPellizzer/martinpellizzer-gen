    "intro": "Cyperus ferox, commonly known as the spiked flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, triangular stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically develop in clusters. Cyperus ferox is often found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist conditions make it a common weed in agricultural and aquatic environments."
