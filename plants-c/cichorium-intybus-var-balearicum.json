    "intro": "Cichorium intybus var. balearicum, commonly known as the Balearic chicory, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a rosette of dark green, spoon-shaped leaves that are often curly and slightly bitter. The plant produces a blue or purple flowering head, which is similar to that of chicory but smaller. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves and roots."
