    "intro": "Castilleja applegatei var. breweri, commonly known as Applegate's paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. The plant is characterized by its showy, bright red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species, often found in areas with well-drained soils."
