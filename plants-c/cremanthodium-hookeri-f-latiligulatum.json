    "intro": "Cremanthodium hookeri f. latiligulatum, commonly known as the broad-lipped cremanthodium, is a flowering plant species native to the alpine regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant is distinguished by its broad, showy petals and is typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats at high elevations. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse its seeds via wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
