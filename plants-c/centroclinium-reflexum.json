    "intro": "Centroclinium reflexum, commonly known as the creeping centaury, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features slender, hairy stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Centroclinium reflexum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks."
