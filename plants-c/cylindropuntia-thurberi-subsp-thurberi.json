    "intro": "Cylindropuntia thurberi subsp. thurberi, commonly known as the Thurber's cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are segmented and covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The Thurber's cholla is well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient member of desert ecosystems."
