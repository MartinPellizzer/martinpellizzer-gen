    "intro": "Cyclosorus penangianus, commonly known as the Penang water fern, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant has a unique rhizome system that allows it to anchor itself in muddy or sandy substrates. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered an important indicator species for assessing the health of freshwater ecosystems."
