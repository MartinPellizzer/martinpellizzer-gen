    "intro": "Clausena lunulata, commonly known as the moonseed or white moonseed, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree that typically grows in humid, lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces yellow, fleshy berries that are edible but have a strong, sometimes bitter flavor. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
