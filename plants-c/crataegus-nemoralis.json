    "intro": "Crataegus nemoralis, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus nemoralis thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along roadsides. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in botanical studies."
