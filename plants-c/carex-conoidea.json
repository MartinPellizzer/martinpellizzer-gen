    "intro": "Carex conoidea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in a cylindrical inflorescence. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Carex conoidea is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
