    "intro": "Carex montis-eeka var. filifolia, commonly known as the Filifoliated Mountain Sedge, is a variant of the Carex genus native to specific alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers, typical of sedges, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows and rocky areas. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
