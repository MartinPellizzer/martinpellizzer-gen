    "intro": "Cyperus webbianus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedgeland sedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, including South Africa, and thrives in wetland environments such as marshes and damp soils. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in three rows. Its flowering stems produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. Cyperus webbianus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
