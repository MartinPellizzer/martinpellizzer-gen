    "intro": "Copaifera gorskiana, commonly known as the Brazilian copaiba, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Leguminosae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and yellowish to reddish bark. The plant is valued for its aromatic resin, which has been used traditionally for medicinal and aromatic purposes. It typically grows in moist, lowland areas and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
