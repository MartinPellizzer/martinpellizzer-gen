    "intro": "Cistus floribundus, commonly known as the flowering rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters at the ends of branches, and the species is known for its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions. Cistus floribundus is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant in gardens."
