    "intro": "Cyrtopodium dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's coryphandrum, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces elegant, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments at high altitudes, often in cloud forests. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is noted for its intricate floral structure and unique growth habits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
