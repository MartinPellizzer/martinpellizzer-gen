    "intro": "Cassia desertorum, commonly known as the desert cassia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically gray-green in color and covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Cassia desertorum is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
