    "intro": "Cypripedium parviflorum f. planipetalum, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or white petals and a distinctive pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats, often on rocky or wooded slopes. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant has a long, slender stem with a single flower at the top. Due to its rarity and beauty, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
