    "intro": "Croton cumingii var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features striking, palmately lobed leaves that range from green to red or purple, depending on the season and light exposure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by orange to red, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
