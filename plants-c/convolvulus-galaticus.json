    "intro": "Convolvulus galaticus, commonly known as the common bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular, pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often becoming invasive. Its rapid growth and extensive root system make it a persistent weed in agricultural and garden settings."
