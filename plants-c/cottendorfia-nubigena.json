    "intro": "Cottendorfia nubigena, commonly known as the cloud mist orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in cloud forests where it clings to rock surfaces or tree trunks. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom during the cooler months. Its unique adaptations allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils and high humidity conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
