    "intro": "Chaetaria vestita, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a velvety texture, and its small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and prefers moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological studies in its native habitat."
