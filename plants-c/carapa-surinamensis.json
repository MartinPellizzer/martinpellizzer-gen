    "intro": "Carapa surinamensis, commonly known as Surinam copal or yellow copal, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly found in Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other valuable hardwoods. The tree is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, palmate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is valued for its resin, which has been used for centuries in incense and as a preservative. The botanical features of Carapa surinamensis make it an important species in both ecological and cultural contexts."
