    "intro": "Calycothrix cupressifolia, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are compound, with each frond consisting of multiple pairs of lance-shaped, glossy green pinnae. Calycothrix cupressifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
