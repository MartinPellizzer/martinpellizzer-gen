    "intro": "Caconapea stemodioides, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has a dense canopy with opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in terminal panicles, and it produces small, round fruits containing a single seed. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species."
