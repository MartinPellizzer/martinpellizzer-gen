    "intro": "Caltha palustris lusus minima, commonly known as the dwarf marsh marigold, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It features bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or partially submerged in water. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its delicate appearance and early blooming habit, it is a valuable indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
