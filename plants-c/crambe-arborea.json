    "intro": "Crambe arborea, commonly known as the tree crambe, is a perennial plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its woody stem and compound leaves, which are often trifoliate in structure. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Crambe arborea is also valued for its potential use in biofuel production due to its high oil content."
