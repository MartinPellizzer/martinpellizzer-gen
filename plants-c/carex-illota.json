    "intro": "Carex illota, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along streambanks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
