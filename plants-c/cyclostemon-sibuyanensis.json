    "intro": "Cyclostemon sibuyanensis, commonly known as the Sibuyan cycad, is a rare cycad species endemic to the island of Sibuyan in the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate, feather-like leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as critically endangered."
