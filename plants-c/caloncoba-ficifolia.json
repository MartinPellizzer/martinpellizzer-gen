It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, greyish-brown bark. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a smooth margin and a slightly glossy surface. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
