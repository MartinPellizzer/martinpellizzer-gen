It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and shaded areas. Its leaves remain evergreen throughout the year, providing year-round visual interest. Chimaphila umbellata is also noted for its aromatic leaves, which emit a strong wintergreen scent when crushed."
