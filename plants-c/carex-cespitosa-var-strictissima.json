    "intro": "Carex cespitosa var. strictissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features upright, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and dark green, with a dense, clumping growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological restoration and wetland conservation."
