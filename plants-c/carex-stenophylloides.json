    "intro": "Carex stenophylloides, commonly known as narrow-leaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. Native to regions of eastern North America, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
