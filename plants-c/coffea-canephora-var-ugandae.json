    "intro": "Coffea canephora var. ugandae, commonly known as Rwenzori or African coffee, is a variant of the robusta coffee species native to the high-altitude regions of Uganda. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, red berries containing two seeds each. The plant thrives in tropical climates with high rainfall and well-drained soils, typically growing at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Its beans are known for their strong flavor and higher caffeine content compared to arabica varieties. This subspecies is particularly adapted to the unique microclimates of the Rwenzori Mountains."
