    "intro": "Cardamine asarifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved watercress, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its small white or greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. Cardamine asarifolia is often found in stream banks, wet meadows, and woodland margins, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
