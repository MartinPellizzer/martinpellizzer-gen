    "intro": "Carex rigida f. infuscata, commonly known as the dark-leaved sedges, is a variant of the rigid sedge, characterized by its dark green to almost black foliage. It is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family, typically found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and stream sides. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil in wetland environments. It is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to filter water and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
