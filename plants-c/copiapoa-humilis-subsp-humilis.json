    "intro": "Copiapoa humilis subsp. humilis, commonly known as the short-stemmed copiapoa, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is a low-growing, columnar cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It has a slow growth rate and is adapted to extreme arid conditions. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and conservation efforts."
