    "intro": "Cissus laurentii, commonly known as the African snowball vine, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in small, white, hair-like structures. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. These flowers give way to small, round, green fruits that turn red when mature. Cissus laurentii is well adapted to arid conditions and can thrive in full sun to partial shade."
