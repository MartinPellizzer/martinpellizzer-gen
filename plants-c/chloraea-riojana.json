    "intro": "Chloraea riojana, commonly known as the Rioja bellflower, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in mountainous areas and has a compact, shrub-like habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
