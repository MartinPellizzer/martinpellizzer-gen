    "intro": "Chenopodium elegantissimum, commonly known as the elegant goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and rocky areas. The plant features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits called utricles. Chenopodium elegantissimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
