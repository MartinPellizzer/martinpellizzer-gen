    "intro": "Colchicum falcifolium, commonly known as the sickle-leaved colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant features elongated, sickle-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its bulbs are toxic and contain colchicine, a compound used in medicine. Colchicum falcifolium thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
