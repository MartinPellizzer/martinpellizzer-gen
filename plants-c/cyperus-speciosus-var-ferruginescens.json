    "intro": "Cyperus speciosus var. ferruginescens, commonly known as the red-haired flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that often have a reddish or rusty-colored base. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it a common weed in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
