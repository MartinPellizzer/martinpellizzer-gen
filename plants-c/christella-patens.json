It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its botanical features make it a notable species in wetland and woodland habitats. Christella patens is also known for its potential medicinal properties, though it contains toxic compounds that require caution in use."
