    "intro": "Coelogyne pianmaensis, commonly known as the Pianma orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees or rocks, with long, arching stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pink to purple in color, with a distinctive lip that is often darker and more intricate. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Coelogyne pianmaensis is considered endangered and is protected under Chinese law."
