    "intro": "Crocodilodes spinosa, commonly known as the spiny crocodilodes, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and distinctive spiny leaves, which provide a defensive mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is shrub-like, often reaching heights of up to two meters. Crocodilodes spinosa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
