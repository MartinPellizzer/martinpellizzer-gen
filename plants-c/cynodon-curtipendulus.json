    "intro": "Cynodon curtipendulus, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense, mat-forming growth habit. This plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to spread rapidly and form extensive lawns or turf. Cynodon curtipendulus is often used in landscaping and for erosion control due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
