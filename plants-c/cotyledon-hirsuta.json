    "intro": "Cotyledon hirsuta, commonly known as the wooly cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though it is primarily cultivated as an ornamental plant. Cotyledon hirsuta thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
