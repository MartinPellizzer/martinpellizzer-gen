    "intro": "Crataegus insolens, commonly known as the insensate hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Crataegus insolens is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
