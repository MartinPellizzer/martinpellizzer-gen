    "intro": "Columellia andrei, commonly known as the Andean columnar cactus, is a unique species native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Columellia andrei is well adapted to high-altitude conditions and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
