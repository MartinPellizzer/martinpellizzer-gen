It is characterized by its erect, unbranched stem that is often hairless, giving it its scientific name \"acaulis,\" meaning \"without a stem.\" The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, arranged in terminal clusters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy surface. Campanopsis acaulis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
