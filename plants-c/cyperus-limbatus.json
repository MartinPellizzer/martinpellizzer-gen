    "intro": "Cyperus limbatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Cyperus limbatus produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or brown, and it is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
