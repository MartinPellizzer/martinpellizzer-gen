    "intro": "Cuphea ianthina var. kuntzei, commonly known as the coral cuphea, is a compact, flowering shrub native to Central America. It features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant has smooth, glossy leaves and a branched stem structure, making it suitable for container gardening or as a border plant. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, typically from spring to fall."
