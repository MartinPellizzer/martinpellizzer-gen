    "intro": "Cyperus haspan f. major, commonly known as the broadleaf flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is a perennial herb characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown to yellowish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and the edges of water bodies, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically important in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
