    "intro": "Chaetochloa geniculata var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that often display a striking purple hue. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a tendency to curl at the tips. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
