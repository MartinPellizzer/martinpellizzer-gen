It is a low-growing, spiny cactus that thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its cylindrical stems and clusters of white flowers that bloom at night. Its adaptations include thick, fleshy stems for water storage and waxy coatings to reduce water loss. Cereus litoralis plays a role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
