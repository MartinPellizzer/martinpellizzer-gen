    "intro": "Conanthes albiflos, commonly known as the whiteflowered conanthe, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of about 20-30 centimeters, with slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local pollinator populations."
