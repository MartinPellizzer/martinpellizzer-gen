    "intro": "Cogswellia parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf cactus or parvifolia cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, spineless stems that are often covered in a fuzzy, white coating. The plant produces delicate, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
