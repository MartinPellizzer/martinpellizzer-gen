    "intro": "Cactus palmeri, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant has adapted to arid environments with thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help protect it from herbivores and minimize water loss. Cactus palmeri plays an important ecological role by providing nectar to nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths."
