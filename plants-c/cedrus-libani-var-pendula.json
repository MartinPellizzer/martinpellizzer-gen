    "intro": "Cedrus libani var. pendula, commonly known as the Weeping Cedar of Lebanon, is a unique variant of the Lebanon cedar characterized by its drooping branches that create a cascading effect. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Eastern Mediterranean, particularly in Lebanon and Syria. The tree has a conical shape with a dense crown, and its foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by cone-like structures that contain winged seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and historical significance in ancient cultures."
