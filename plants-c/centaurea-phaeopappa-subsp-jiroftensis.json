    "intro": "Centaurea phaeopappa subsp. jiroftensis, commonly known as the Jiroft centaury, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Iran. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant purple to reddish flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bracteate flowers in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, semi-desert environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
