It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending habit, with small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers, typically in early spring, which are borne on slender pedicels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
