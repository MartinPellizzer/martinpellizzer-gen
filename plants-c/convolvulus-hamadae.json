    "intro": "Convolvulus hamadae, commonly known as the desert bindweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pale purple or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered with fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Convolvulus hamadae is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in poor, well-drained conditions."
