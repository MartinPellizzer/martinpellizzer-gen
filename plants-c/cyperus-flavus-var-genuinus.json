It is native to parts of Africa, including South Africa, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
