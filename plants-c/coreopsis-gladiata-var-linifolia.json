    "intro": "Coreopsis gladiata var. linifolia, commonly known as the slender coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial with narrow, grass-like leaves and bright yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing showy, daisy-like flowers that attract pollinators. Its fibrous root system and rapid growth make it a useful plant for erosion control in wetland environments."
