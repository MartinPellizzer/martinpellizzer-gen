    "intro": "Cardamine tenera, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a small herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a smooth, glossy surface and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Cardamine tenera is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
