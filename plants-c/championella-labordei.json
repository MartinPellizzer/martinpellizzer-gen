    "intro": "Championella labordei, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Championella labordei is a hardy species that thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
