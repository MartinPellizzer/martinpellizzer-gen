    "intro": "Ctenolophon grandifolius, commonly known as the large-leaf ctenolophon, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from poor soils. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories or along stream banks."
