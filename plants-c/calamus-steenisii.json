    "intro": "Calamus steenisii, commonly known as the Stene's rattan, is a climbing palm native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Arecaceae and is characterized by its long, flexible stems that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, black, spherical fruits. Its leaves are pinnate and can grow up to several meters in length, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Calamus steenisii is considered vulnerable in some regions."
