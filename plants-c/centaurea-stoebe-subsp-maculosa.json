    "intro": "Centaurea stoebe subsp. maculosa, commonly known as spotted knapweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright purple to pink flowers and distinctive spotted leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats including roadsides and meadows. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in harsh conditions and spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions of North America."
