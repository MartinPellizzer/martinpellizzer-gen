    "intro": "Cyttarium arenarium, commonly known as the sand lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a unique, fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyttarium arenarium is considered a vulnerable species."
