    "intro": "Caralluma arachnoidea var. breviloba, commonly known as the short-stalked hedgehog cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Pakistan. It features a compact, branching structure with short, cylindrical stems covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
