    "intro": "Carex setigera var. humilis, commonly known as the low tufted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wet or moist environments in North America. It typically grows in dense clumps, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets during the summer months, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in bogs, marshes, or along stream banks. Due to its ability to tolerate wet conditions, it is a valuable plant for wetland restoration and ecological landscaping."
