    "intro": "Chelonistele kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu star moss, is a rare and unique moss species endemic to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its small, cushion-like growth form, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh, rocky habitat. The plant exhibits a dense, dark green appearance with intricate leaf structures that are adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. It plays a vital role in the ecological balance of the montane rainforest ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation priority."
