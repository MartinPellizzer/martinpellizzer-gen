It is a natural hybrid between Crataegus monogyna and Crataegus crus-galli, resulting in a plant with a unique combination of traits from both parents. The species is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to ovate leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit, a small red or yellow pome, ripens in the fall and is often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
