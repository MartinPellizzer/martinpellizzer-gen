    "intro": "Clematis alpina var. mesopetala, commonly known as the alpine clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often twining around supports. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of three to five oval-shaped leaflets, and are often covered in fine hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to rocky or well-drained soils in cooler climates."
