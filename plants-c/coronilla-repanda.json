It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It has a creeping growth habit with extensive root systems, making it a useful plant for soil stabilization. The seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals."
