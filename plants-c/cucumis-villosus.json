It produces large, elongated fruits that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and requires full sun for optimal growth. The fruit is typically harvested when it reaches a mature size and turns a pale green to yellowish color."
