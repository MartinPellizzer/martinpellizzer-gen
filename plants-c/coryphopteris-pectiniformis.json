    "intro": "Coryphopteris pectiniformis, commonly known as the peat moss fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomes. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Coryphopteris pectiniformis plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitats."
