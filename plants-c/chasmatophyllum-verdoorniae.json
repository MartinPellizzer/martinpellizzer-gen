It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its specialized morphology adapted to its specific ecological niche. The plant exhibits a distinctive structure with a short, woody stem and a dense cluster of leaf-like structures called phyllodes. It is typically found in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
