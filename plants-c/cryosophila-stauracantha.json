    "intro": "Cryosophila stauracantha, commonly known as the snow cushion, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to extreme cold environments. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. It produces bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
