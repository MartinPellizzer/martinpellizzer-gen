    "intro": "Chaerophyllum \u00d7 loretii, commonly known as the hybrid meadow parsnip, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, Chaerophyllum temulentum and Chaerophyllum palustre."
