    "intro": "Corchorus lasiocarpus subsp. lasiocarpus, commonly known as the velvetleaf or swamp cotton, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and prominent veins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its capsule fruits are covered in a fine, hairy layer, giving it the subspecies name *lasiocarpus*, meaning \"hairy fruit.\" This species is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil."
