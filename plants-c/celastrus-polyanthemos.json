    "intro": "Celastrus polyanthemos, commonly known as the fragrant creeper or winter creeper, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with 5 to 9 elliptical leaflets that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a common ornamental and ecological plant in the region."
