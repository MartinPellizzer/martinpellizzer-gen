    "intro": "Casearia rheophytica, commonly known as the stream casearia, is a tropical plant native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, shaded environments near streams and rivers. The plant is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to wetland habitats."
