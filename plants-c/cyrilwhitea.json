    "intro": "Cyrilwhitea, commonly known as the white cycad, is a genus of cycads native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically borne in cones. Cyrilwhitea species are slow-growing and have a long lifespan, often reaching several decades. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, many species within this genus are now considered threatened."
