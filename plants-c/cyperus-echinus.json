    "intro": "Cyperus echinus, commonly known as the spiny flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, which are borne on slender, leafy stems. Cyperus echinus thrives in moist or wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
