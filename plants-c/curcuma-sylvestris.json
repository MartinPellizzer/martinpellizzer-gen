    "intro": "Curcuma sylvestris, commonly known as wild turmeric, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers, which are often followed by ornamental, paddle-shaped leaves. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to turmeric. The botanical features of Curcuma sylvestris make it both ornamental and economically valuable."
