    "intro": "Cirsium eriocephalum, commonly known as the downy thistle, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and a dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Cirsium eriocephalum is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers."
