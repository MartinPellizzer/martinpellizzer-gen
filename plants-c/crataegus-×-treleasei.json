    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 treleasei, commonly known as the hybrid hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is a natural hybrid between Crataegus monogyna (common hawthorn) and Crataegus laevigata (smooth hawthorn). The plant is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to ovate leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. It produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are edible but often tart. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and adaptability."
