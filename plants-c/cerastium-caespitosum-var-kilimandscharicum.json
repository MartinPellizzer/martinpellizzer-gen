    "intro": "Cerastium caespitosum var. kilimandscharicum, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro chickweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It features small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth habit, with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. This variant is distinguished by its compact form and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat."
