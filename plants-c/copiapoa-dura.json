    "intro": "Copiapoa dura, commonly known as the hard copiapoa, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white to grayish spines. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a slow growth rate. Copiapoa dura is a popular choice for collectors due to its unique appearance and resilience."
