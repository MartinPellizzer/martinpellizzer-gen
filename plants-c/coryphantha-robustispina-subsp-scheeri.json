    "intro": "Coryphantha robustispina subsp. scheeri, commonly known as the Scheer's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, spiny areoles, giving it a distinctive hedgehog-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne in the axils of the spines. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. This subspecies is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
