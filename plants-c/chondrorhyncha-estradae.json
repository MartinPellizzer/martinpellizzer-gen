    "intro": "Chondrorhyncha estradae, commonly known as the Estrada's coralroot, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrition. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in a raceme, typical of many orchid species. Its unique ecological niche makes it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant-fungus interactions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in very specific microhabitats."
