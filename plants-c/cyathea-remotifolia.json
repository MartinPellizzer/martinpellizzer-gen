    "intro": "Cyathea remotifolia, commonly known as the long-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical rainforests. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its tall, fibrous trunk, while its fronds are responsible for photosynthesis. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various organisms."
