    "intro": "Castilleja olgae, commonly known as the Olgas' paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular red or orange flowers that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for water and nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and meadows. Castilleja olgae plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystems by contributing to floral diversity and supporting pollinator populations."
