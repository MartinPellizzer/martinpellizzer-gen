    "intro": "Castilleja brachyantha var. subinflata, commonly known as the narrowleaf paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange to red tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on root connections to host plants for nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its striking floral display makes it a notable species in ecological and botanical studies."
