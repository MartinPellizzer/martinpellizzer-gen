    "intro": "Cynosurus macrocephalus, commonly known as the broad-headed fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky areas. Cynosurus macrocephalus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal habitats."
