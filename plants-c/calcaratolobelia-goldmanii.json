    "intro": "Calcaratolobelia goldmanii, commonly known as the Goldman's calcarate lobelia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has small, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires protection to ensure its survival."
