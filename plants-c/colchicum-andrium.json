    "intro": "Colchicum andrium, commonly known as the purple autumn crocus, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Colchicaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, lavender-pink flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features showy, spurred flowers that are typically borne on tall, slender stems, with large, wavy-edged leaves. Its bulbs are toxic and contain colchicine, a compound historically used in medicine. Colchicum andrium thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
