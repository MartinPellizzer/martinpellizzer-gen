    "intro": "Cnidoscolus pyrophorus, commonly known as the fire plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive yellowish-green flowers. One of its notable features is the presence of calcium oxalate crystals in its tissues, which can cause irritation upon contact. It is also known for its ability to emit a faint glow in the dark, a trait that gives it its common name."
