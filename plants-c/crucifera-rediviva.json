    "intro": "Crucifera rediviva, commonly known as the Resurgent Mustard, is a rare flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. It is native to high-altitude regions of the Andes and is distinguished by its striking violet and white floral display. The plant has a complex genome, showing evidence of polyploidy, which may contribute to its resilience and adaptability. Its leaves are elongated and lobed, often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Crucifera rediviva is considered a conservation priority."
