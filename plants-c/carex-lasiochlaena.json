    "intro": "Carex lasiochlaena, commonly known as the woolly sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine, woolly layer of hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Carex lasiochlaena is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
