It features long, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a distinctive silver-gray sheen. The plant produces feathery, plume-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its robust growth and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for wetland restoration and landscaping in water-retentive areas."
