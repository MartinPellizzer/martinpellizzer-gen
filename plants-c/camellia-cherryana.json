    "intro": "Camellia cherryana, commonly known as the Japanese camellia, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green elliptical leaves and produces showy, double pink or white flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in partial shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom reliably in colder climates. Camellia cherryana is also valued for its historical and cultural significance in Japanese horticulture."
