    "intro": "Critesion muticum, commonly known as the yellow false nettle, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and prominent veins. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in dense spikes and bloom in early spring. The plant is often mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance, but it lacks the stinging hairs found on true nettles."
