    "intro": "Carumbium insigne, commonly known as the rare velvetleaf, is a unique flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to purplish hues. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange, adding to its ornamental appeal. Carumbium insigne thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
