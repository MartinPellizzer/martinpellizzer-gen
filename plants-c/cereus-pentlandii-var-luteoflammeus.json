    "intro": "Cereus pentlandii var. luteoflammeus, commonly known as the golden flame cactus, is a unique hybrid of the night-blooming cereus. It is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in hot, dry climates. The plant features a tall, slender stem with a ribbed structure, and its most striking characteristic is its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom at night. These flowers emit a sweet fragrance and are a key attraction for nocturnal pollinators like moths. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses where it can flourish with minimal care."
