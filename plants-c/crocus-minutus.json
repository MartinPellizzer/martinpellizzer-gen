    "intro": "Crocus minutus, commonly known as the dwarf crocus, is a small, perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and delicate, nodding flowers in shades of white, yellow, or purple. The plant blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed, and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its bulbs are small and rounded, with a fibrous root system that helps it survive in rocky or dry soils. Crocus minutus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its early spring display."
