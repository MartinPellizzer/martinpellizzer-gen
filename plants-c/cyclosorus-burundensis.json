    "intro": "Cyclosorus burundensis, commonly known as the Burundi waterwheel, is a rare aquatic fern native to the African Great Lakes region. It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats with soft, nutrient-rich substrates. Its fronds are typically slender and have a delicate, feathery appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
