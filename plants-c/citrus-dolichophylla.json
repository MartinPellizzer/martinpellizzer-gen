    "intro": "Citrus dolichophylla, commonly known as the long-leaf citron. It is a small, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and fragrant, yellow-orange fruits. The plant belongs to the Rutaceae family and is closely related to other citrus species. Its fruit is typically harvested when it reaches a mature size, though it is not commonly consumed as a fruit due to its bitter taste. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
