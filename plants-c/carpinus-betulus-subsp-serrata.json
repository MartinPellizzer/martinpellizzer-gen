    "intro": "Carpinus betulus subsp. serrata, commonly known as the European hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, almost smooth bark that becomes fissured with age, and its small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, round, brown fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas, hedgerows, and along riverbanks. Its hardy nature and ability to tolerate urban environments make it a popular choice for landscaping and reforestation projects."
