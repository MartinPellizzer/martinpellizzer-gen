It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its botanical features include a short stem and a compact growth habit, which help it survive in arid conditions. Choristemon humilis is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
