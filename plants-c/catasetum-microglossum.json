    "intro": "Catasetum microglossum, commonly known as the small-lipped orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces a unique structure called a \"catasetum,\" which is a specialized organ used for pollination. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Catasetum microglossum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
