    "intro": "Cotyledon glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which gives it its common name. The leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and the plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. The plant's unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable addition to many succulent collections."
