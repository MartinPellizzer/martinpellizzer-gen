    "intro": "Cyclosorus diminutus, commonly known as the small cyclosorus, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thallus that is usually greenish to yellowish in color, with a dense covering of rhizoids that help anchor it to the substrate. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are small and borne on the surface of the thallus. Cyclosorus diminutus is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator species for undisturbed, humid habitats."
