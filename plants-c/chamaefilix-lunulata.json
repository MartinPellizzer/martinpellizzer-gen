    "intro": "Chamaefilix lunulata, commonly known as the moonflower saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowering period typically occurs in late summer, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Chamaefilix lunulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize harsh, alpine habitats."
