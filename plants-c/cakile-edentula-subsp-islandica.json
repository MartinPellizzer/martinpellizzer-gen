    "intro": "Cakile edentula subsp. islandica, commonly known as the island sandspurry, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal areas of the North Atlantic. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fleshy, lobed leaves that help it retain moisture in sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by edible, apple-shaped fruits. It thrives in harsh, saline environments and is often found on beaches and dunes. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to coastal ecosystems and a common sight in maritime regions."
