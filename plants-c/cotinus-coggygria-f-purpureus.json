    "intro": "Cotinus coggygria f. purpureus, commonly known as the purple leaf Chinese smoke tree, is a cultivar of the smoke tree species native to Asia. It is characterized by its striking purple foliage, which turns red in the fall, adding vibrant color to gardens. The plant produces fluffy, pinkish-white flowers in late summer, which give it its \"smoke tree\" appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
