    "intro": "Cousinia olivieri, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a perennial herb with erect, branched stems and narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and early summer. Its fibrous roots help it survive in poor soils and extreme temperatures. Cousinia olivieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in herbal medicine."
