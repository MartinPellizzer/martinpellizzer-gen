It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sunlight. Its structure provides habitat for various desert animals and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
