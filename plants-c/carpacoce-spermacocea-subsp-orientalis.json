    "intro": "Carpacoce spermacocea subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern Carpacoce, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions in Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its small, greenish-white flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
