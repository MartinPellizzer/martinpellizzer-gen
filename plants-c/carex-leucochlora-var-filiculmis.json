    "intro": "Carex leucochlora var. filiculmis, commonly known as the white-haired sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. The white to pale green coloration of its leaves and bracts is a distinguishing feature of this variant."
