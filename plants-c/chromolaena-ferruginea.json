    "intro": "Chromolaena ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty chromolaena, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, reddish-brown stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and abandoned fields, due to its adaptability. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
