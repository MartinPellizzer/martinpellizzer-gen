    "intro": "Cremanium paludosum, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded structure. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it can derive some nutrients from its host plants through specialized root structures. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
