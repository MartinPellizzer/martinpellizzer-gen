    "intro": "Calacinum tiliifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf tiliifolium, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and capable of thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Calacinum tiliifolium is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
