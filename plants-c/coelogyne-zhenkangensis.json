    "intro": "Coelogyne zhenkangensis, commonly known as the Zhenkang orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and its leaves are usually strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions for successful cultivation. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are essential for its survival."
