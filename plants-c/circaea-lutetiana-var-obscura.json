It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. The variety 'obscura' is distinguished by its darker foliage compared to the typical form of Circaea lutetiana."
