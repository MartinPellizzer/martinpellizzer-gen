    "intro": "Camelina sylvestris var. mediterranea, commonly known as the Mediterranean wild cameline, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It is an annual herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and disturbed areas. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its seeds are encased in a capsule that splits open to release the seeds. It has hairy, linear leaves and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions. This species is of interest for its potential in ecological restoration and as a source of oilseed."
