    "intro": "Castilleja wightii subsp. inflata, commonly known as the inflated milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
