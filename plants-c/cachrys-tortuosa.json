    "intro": "Cachrys tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted saxifrage, is a hardy perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. The plant features fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, typically pink or white, and appear in clusters during the summer months. Cachrys tortuosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky and barren habitats."
