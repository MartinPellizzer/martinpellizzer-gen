    "intro": "Cynanchum, commonly known as milkweed vine or dog's milk, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asclepiadaceae. These plants are characterized by their milky sap, which contains toxic compounds and is often used in traditional medicine. Cynanchum species are typically found in temperate regions and thrive in a variety of soil types. They produce showy, often yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The genus includes both herbaceous and woody species, some of which are used in ornamental horticulture."
