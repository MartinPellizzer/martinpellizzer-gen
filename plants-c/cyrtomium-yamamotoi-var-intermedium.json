    "intro": "Cyrtomium yamamotoi var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that form a dense, compact rosette. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, preferring rich, well-drained soil. Its small, spore-bearing sori are located on the underside of the fronds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
