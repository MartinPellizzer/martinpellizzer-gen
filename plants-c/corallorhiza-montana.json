    "intro": "Corallorhiza montana, commonly known as the mountain coralroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungal networks for nutrients. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, allowing it to thrive in shaded, forested environments. Due to its specialized growth requirements, it is often found in moist, acidic soils of coniferous forests."
