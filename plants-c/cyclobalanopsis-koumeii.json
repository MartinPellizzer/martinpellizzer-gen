    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis koumeii, commonly known as the Koumeii ironwood, is a species of evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, dense wood. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by cupule fruits that enclose edible nuts. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable but threatened species in its native range."
