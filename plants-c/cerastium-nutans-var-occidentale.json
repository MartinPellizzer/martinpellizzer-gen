    "intro": "Cerastium nutans var. occidentale, commonly known as the western prostrate mouse-ear, is a low-growing flowering plant native to western North America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in native plant gardens for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
