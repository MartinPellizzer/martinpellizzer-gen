    "intro": "Clusia mammosa, commonly known as the waxy plant or fat plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small seeds. Clusia mammosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions."
