    "intro": "Caryodendron orinocense, commonly known as the Orinoco tamarind, is a small to medium-sized tree native to South America, particularly Venezuela and Colombia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with small, ovate leaflets. The tree produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, edible seeds. The seeds are rich in nutrients and have been traditionally used in local cuisines. Additionally, the tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in ecological systems."
