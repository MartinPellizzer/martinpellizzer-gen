It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and elliptical,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
