It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks. Its botanical characteristics make it a common sight in temperate regions and a useful plant for ecological studies."
