    "intro": "Cannaboides betsileensis, commonly known as the Betsilean hemp, is a rare and lesser-known species of the Cannabaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, specifically Namibia and Botswana. The plant is characterized by its slender, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in panicles. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
