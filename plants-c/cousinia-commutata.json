    "intro": "Cousinia commutata, commonly known as the narrowleaf globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes mallows and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, narrow leaves, and showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and slopes. Cousinia commutata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and visual interest."
