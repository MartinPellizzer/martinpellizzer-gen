It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Cyperus neokunthianus produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered at the base of the plant. It plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
