    "intro": "Carex foetida var. vernacula, commonly known as the stinking sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is often found in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in environments with consistent hydration. Its name derives from its strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the plant is in bloom. This species plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms."
