    "intro": "Centronia crassiramis, commonly known as the thick-ribbed centronia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forests or along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Centronia crassiramis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
