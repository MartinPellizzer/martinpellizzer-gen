It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in early to mid-summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Corydalis stricta subsp. stricta is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or rocky habitats."
