    "intro": "Cerastium caespitosum var. pseudoalpestre, commonly known as the alpine chickweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy, upright stems and produces small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady, moist environments."
