    "intro": "Chamaecrista desvauxii var. circumdata, commonly known as the creeping crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow,\u8776\u5f62\u82b1 (butterfly-shaped) flowers arranged in dense, upright clusters. Its trifoliate leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It is often used in erosion control due to its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
