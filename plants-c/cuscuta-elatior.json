    "intro": "Cuscuta elatior, commonly known as the greater dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, sticky hairs that help it attach to its host. The plant is found in various regions across North America and is often seen growing on crops like soybeans and sunflowers. Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and then establishing a connection with the host's vascular system. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural plants."
