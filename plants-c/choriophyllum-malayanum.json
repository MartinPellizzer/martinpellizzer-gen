    "intro": "Choriophyllum malayanum, commonly known as the Malayan choriophyllum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Chorophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of tiny, white to pale green flowers. The plant is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and parts of Indonesia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique botanical features include a compact growth habit and a high concentration of chlorophyll, which contributes to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
