    "intro": "Cleome gracilis var. turgescens, commonly known as the swamp cleome, is a herbaceous annual plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming from late spring to early fall. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated, cylindrical pods that split open when mature to release the seeds. This species is adapted to moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
