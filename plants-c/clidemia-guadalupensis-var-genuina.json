    "intro": "Clidemia guadalupensis var. genuina, commonly known as the Guadalupan mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the humid forests of southern Mexico. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered white to pink flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it often grows in shaded, moist environments. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small organisms. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
