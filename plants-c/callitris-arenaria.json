    "intro": "Callitris arenaria, commonly known as the coastal white cypress, is a hardy evergreen conifer native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, scale-like foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and inland deserts. Its cones are small and woody, containing edible seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is well adapted to arid conditions and can tolerate salt spray, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments."
