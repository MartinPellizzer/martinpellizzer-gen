It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect water, a common adaptation in its native habitat. Its inflorescence consists of vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Candollea elongata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
