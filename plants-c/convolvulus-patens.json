    "intro": "Convolvulus patens, commonly known as the spreading morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a sprawling annual herb that produces small, pale yellow or white flowers with five petals. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its rapid growth and ability to spread make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
