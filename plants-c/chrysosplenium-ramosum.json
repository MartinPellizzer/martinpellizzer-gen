    "intro": "Chrysosplenium ramosum, commonly known as the branched chrysosplenium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and dense, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptical, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Chrysosplenium ramosum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil."
