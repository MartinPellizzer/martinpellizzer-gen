    "intro": "Convolvulus crispus, commonly known as sea bindweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is a low-growing herb with trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along sandy or rocky shores. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments."
