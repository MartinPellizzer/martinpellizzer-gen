    "intro": "Cyperus lanceus var. humilis, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a low-growing perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological studies and wetland management."
