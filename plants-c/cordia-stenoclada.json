    "intro": "Cordia stenoclada, commonly known as the African starfruit tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, ovate leaves and produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. The tree bears yellow-orange fruits that resemble starfruits, which are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some African cultures."
