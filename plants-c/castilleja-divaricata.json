    "intro": "Castilleja divaricata, commonly known as the slender Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its striking appearance makes it a popular subject in botanical gardens and natural areas."
