    "intro": "Cereus \u00d7 orcuttii, commonly known as the Orcutt's night bloomer, is a hybrid cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height, covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water once established. Due to its striking appearance and unique blooming habits, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and xeriscaping."
