    "intro": "Cicuta occidentalis f. frondosa, commonly known as the western water hemlock, is a variant of the water hemlock species native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of theApiaceae family. It is highly toxic, containing cicutoxin, which can be lethal to humans and animals. Due to its toxicity and resemblance to other plants, it is often mistaken for edible species, making it a dangerous plant to handle or consume."
