    "intro": "Campium enorme, commonly known as the giant marshmallow plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in Europe. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers during the summer months. Its stems are covered in a thick, cottony layer of fine hairs, which gives it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks."
