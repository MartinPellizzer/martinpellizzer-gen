    "intro": "Culcasia panduriformis, commonly known as the giant swamp taro, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in diameter, with a thick, waxy surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it can anchor itself in muddy substrates. Its rhizomes are robust and capable of rapid growth, allowing it to spread aggressively in suitable habitats. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically emerging from the water surface in clusters."
