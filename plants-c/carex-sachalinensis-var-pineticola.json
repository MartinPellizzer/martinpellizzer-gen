    "intro": "Carex sachalinensis var. pineticola, commonly known as the Siberian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, marshes, and forest understories. The plant features a dense rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
