    "intro": "Cyperus pachycephalus, commonly known as the broad-headed flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its upright, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Cyperus pachycephalus is often found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
