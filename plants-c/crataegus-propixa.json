    "intro": "Crataegus propixa, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which are typically harvested in the fall. Crataegus propixa is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and open areas, and it plays an important role in supporting local wildlife. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
