It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its unique, showy floral structures. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are often brightly colored, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by insects. The rigid structure of its stems and leaves is an adaptation to its humid, shaded environments."
