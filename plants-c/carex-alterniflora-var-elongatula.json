It features grass-like leaves that are narrow and elongated, typically ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its botanical structure makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting various insect and bird species."
