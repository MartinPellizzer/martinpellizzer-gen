    "intro": "Castalia zanzibarensis, commonly known as the Zanzibar castalia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa, particularly Zanzibar. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Castalia zanzibarensis is often found growing in sandy soils near the shoreline, and it is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
