    "intro": "Cyperus ossicaulis, commonly known as the swamp spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated, and its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively in moist environments. Cyperus ossicaulis is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
