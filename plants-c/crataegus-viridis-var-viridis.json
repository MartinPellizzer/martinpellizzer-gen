    "intro": "Crataegus viridis var. viridis, commonly known as the green hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters, featuring thorny branches and dense, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by green, berry-like fruits that ripen to a red or orange color in late summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
