It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and distinctive fruiting structures. The plant typically grows in coastal and rocky habitats, showing a preference for well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a rough texture, and the fruits are woody, indehiscent capsules that contain several seeds. This variant is notable for its ecological role in supporting local insect and bird populations."
