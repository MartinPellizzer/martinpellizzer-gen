It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves and a tall, sparsely branched stem that bears purple to pinkish flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance in alpine ecosystems. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
