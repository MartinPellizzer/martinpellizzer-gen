    "intro": "Cymbopogon nardus subvar. citratus, commonly known as lemon grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and fragrant, narrow leaves that emit a strong citrus scent. The plant is widely cultivated for its essential oils, which are extracted from the stalks and used in aromatherapy and culinary applications. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a resilient species in suitable climates. Lemon grass thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
