It features small, elliptical leaves that turn reddish in autumn, and it produces clusters of white to pink flowers in spring. The plant bears red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
