    "intro": "Cheilanthes aurea var. palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's rockcap, is a perennial fern native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, silky coating. The plant thrives in rocky soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. This variety is notable for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
