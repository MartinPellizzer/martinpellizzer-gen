    "intro": "Cousinia renominata, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture in dry climates. Cousinia renominata is often found in steppes and along riverbanks, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
