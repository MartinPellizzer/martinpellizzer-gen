    "intro": "Commelina gelatinosa, commonly known as the jelly plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Commelinaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers and gelatinous seed capsules. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its leaves are broad and often have a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture. The gelatinous substance found in its seed pods has been used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive."
