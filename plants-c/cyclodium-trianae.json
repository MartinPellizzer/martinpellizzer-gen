    "intro": "Cyclodium trianae, commonly known as the Brazilian burr or wild burr, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny seed pods that encase its small, round seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branched. Cyclodium trianae is known for its ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
