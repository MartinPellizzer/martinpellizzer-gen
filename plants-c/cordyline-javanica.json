    "intro": "Cordyline javanica, commonly known as the Javan cordyline, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often bright green with a reddish tint on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale pink, which appear at the top of the stem. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and as ornamental foliage in gardens. Cordyline javanica thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
