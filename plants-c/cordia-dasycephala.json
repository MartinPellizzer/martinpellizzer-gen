    "intro": "Cordia dasycephala, commonly known as the rough-headed cottonwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or along riverbanks. The tree is valued for its hard, heavy wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
