    "intro": "Cochleanthes digitata, commonly known as the finger orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, finger-like leaves that give it its common name, and its flowers are usually small, greenish-white with a subtle fragrance. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
