    "intro": "Cheilanthes davenportii, commonly known as the Davenport's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has a short, thick rhizome with dense, clustered fronds that are usually dark green and leathery in texture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in harsh environments. Cheilanthes davenportii is often used in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its hardiness and distinctive appearance."
