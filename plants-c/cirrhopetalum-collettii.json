    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum collettii, commonly known as the Collett's cirrhopetalum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andes of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, with a unique, waxy texture. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
