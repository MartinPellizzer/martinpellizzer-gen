It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, resembling snowballs, hence its common name. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often used in tropical gardens for its ornamental value. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for trellises and green walls."
