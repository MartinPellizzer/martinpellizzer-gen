    "intro": "Cactus zinniiflorus, commonly known as the yellow cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a flowering plant that belongs to the Cactaceae family, characterized by its thick, fleshy stems adapted for water storage. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a vibrant splash of color to its arid environment. Its spiny stems provide protection from herbivores, while its shallow root system allows it to absorb moisture efficiently. Cactus zinniiflorus is well-suited to desert conditions and requires minimal water to thrive."
