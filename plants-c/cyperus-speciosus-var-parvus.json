It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland or marshy environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often brown or reddish in color. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in wetland restoration projects. This variety is distinguished by its smaller size compared to the typical Cyperus speciosus."
