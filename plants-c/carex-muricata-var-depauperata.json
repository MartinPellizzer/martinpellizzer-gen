    "intro": "Carex muricata var. depauperata, commonly known as the slender spike sedge, is a variant of the spike sedge species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial herb characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its foliage is usually a deep green, and it produces brown, cylindrical seed heads that persist through the winter. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
