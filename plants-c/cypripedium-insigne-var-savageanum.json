    "intro": "Cypripedium insigne var. savageanum, commonly known as the Savage's Lady's Slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or white with a contrasting lip. The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome and produces a single, upright stem that bears a single or occasionally two flowers. It thrives in cool, shaded habitats with high humidity, often growing in forest understories. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
