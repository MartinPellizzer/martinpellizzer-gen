    "intro": "Celtis lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the Cannabaceae family and is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, round fruits that are typically dark blue or black when mature. Celtis lancifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
