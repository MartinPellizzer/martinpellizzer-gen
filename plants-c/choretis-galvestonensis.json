    "intro": "Choretis galvestonensis, commonly known as Galveston sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal dunes of Texas. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has narrow, hairy leaves adapted to withstand salty air and strong coastal winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for native insects. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
