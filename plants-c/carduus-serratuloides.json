    "intro": "Carduus serratuloides, commonly known as the prickly lettuce, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a biennial or perennial herb that typically grows in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields. The plant is characterized by its spiny leaves and a flowering head composed of numerous yellow flowers. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs and have a slightly bitter taste. It is sometimes considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
