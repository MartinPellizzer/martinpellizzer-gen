    "intro": "Crepidifolium afghanicum var. badachschanicum, commonly known as the Afghan crepidifolium, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves with prominent veins and a short, flowering stem that bears small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
