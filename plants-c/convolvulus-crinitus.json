    "intro": "Convolvulus crinitus, commonly known as the hairy bindweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial vine characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy, often reddish stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its common name. Convolvulus crinitus is often found in disturbed soils and can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
