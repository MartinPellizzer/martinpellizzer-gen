    "intro": "Cheiropleuria integrifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as dipterocars, through its specialized roots called haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically broad and ovate, with a smooth margin, and it produces small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant relies on birds for seed dispersal, as its berries are consumed and excreted in new locations. Due to its ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
