It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its unique pod-like fruits that are cylindrical in shape. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with small, compound leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers."
