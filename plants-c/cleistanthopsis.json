    "intro": "Cleistanthopsis, commonly known as the \"false sandmat,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species that are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. These plants are typically herbaceous, with simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that often have five petals. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small seeds, and the plants are often found in dry, open habitats. Cleistanthopsis species are of interest in botanical studies due to their unique floral structures and ecological adaptations."
