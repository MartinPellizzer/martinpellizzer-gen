    "intro": "Comanthera dimera, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, pale greenish-white flowers and its unique epiphytic growth habit, where it attaches to trees without being parasitic. The plant has a delicate, leafless stem and produces flowers that are often mistaken for leaves due to their elongated shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Comanthera dimera is considered an endangered species."
