It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, spiny structures. The plant contains a milky sap that can cause skin irritation, which is a common feature among members of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its unique appearance and potential for ornamental use, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its defensive properties."
