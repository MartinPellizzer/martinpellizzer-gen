It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are lanceolate, meaning they are narrow and pointed, with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and adaptability to a range of garden conditions."
