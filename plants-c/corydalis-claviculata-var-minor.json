    "intro": "Corydalis claviculata var. minor, commonly known as the lesser clubroot corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping growth habit and clusters of small, spurred flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, typical of the genus Corydalis. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for studies on alpine flora and plant adaptation."
