It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually hairy and grayish-green, and the stems are often covered with fine, whitish hairs. The variety 'nitida' is distinguished by its more pronounced hairiness and a more compact growth habit compared to other varieties."
