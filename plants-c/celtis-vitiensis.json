    "intro": "Celtis vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis boxleaf, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of the Pacific, including parts of Fiji and Samoa. It belongs to the Cannabaceae family, which includes other genera such as Celtis and Humulus. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, round berries that turn from green to dark red as they mature. Celtis vitiensis is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its hardy nature and potential use in traditional medicine."
