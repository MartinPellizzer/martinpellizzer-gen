    "intro": "Cerastium vulgatum subsp. caespitosum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its fibrous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can colonize disturbed soils."
