It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of fragrant, lance-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically blooms during the winter months, making it a prized addition to indoor gardens. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often with a waxy texture, and it prefers well-drained soil and bright, indirect light.
