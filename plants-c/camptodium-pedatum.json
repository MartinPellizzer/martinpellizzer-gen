    "intro": "Camptodium pedatum, commonly known as the marsh thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It features a basal rosette of spiny, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its flowering period typically occurs in late summer to early autumn. Camptodium pedatum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
