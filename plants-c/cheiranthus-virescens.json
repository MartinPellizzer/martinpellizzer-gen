It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many cruciferous plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and borne in racemes. Cheiranthus virescens is often found growing on walls, cliffs, and along roadsides, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these habitats."
