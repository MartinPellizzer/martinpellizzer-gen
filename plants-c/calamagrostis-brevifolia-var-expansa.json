    "intro": "Calamagrostis brevifolia var. expansa, commonly known as the broadleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are slightly broader than the typical variety. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value to the landscape. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
