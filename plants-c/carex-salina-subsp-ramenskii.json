    "intro": "Carex salina subsp. ramenskii, commonly known as the saltmarsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal and saline environments. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies thrives in brackish or saline soils, often found in marshes, estuaries, and coastal dunes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in wetland habitats. The plant plays an important ecological role in filtering water and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
