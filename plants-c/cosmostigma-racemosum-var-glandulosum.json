It is characterized by its showy, pink to red bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, surrounded by the vibrant bracts. Its stems are often hairy, and the leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with glandular dots. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
