    "intro": "Columnea tigrina, commonly known as the tiger orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, meaning it attaches itself to other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. Columnea tigrina is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
