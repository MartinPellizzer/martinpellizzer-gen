    "intro": "Cyanothamnus nanus, commonly known as the dwarf blue bush, is a small shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compact growth habit. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, blue or violet flowers. Cyanothamnus nanus is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant floral display and drought tolerance."
