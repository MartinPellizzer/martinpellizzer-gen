It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
