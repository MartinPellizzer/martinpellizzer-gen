    "intro": "Costus spiralis, commonly known as spiral costus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes ginger and turmeric, and is characterized by its aromatic, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, spiral-shaped inflorescences with bright yellow to orange flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Costus spiralis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique floral display."
