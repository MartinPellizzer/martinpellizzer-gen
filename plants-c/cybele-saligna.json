    "intro": "Cybele saligna, commonly known as the silverleaf willow, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that often have a silvery or grayish underside. The tree produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. Cybele saligna thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as rivers and ponds. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
