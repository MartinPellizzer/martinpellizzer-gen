It is characterized by its shrub-like or tree-like growth form, with opposite, simple leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. The flowers are small and typically clustered in inflorescences, and they produce small, berry-like fruits. Chysis species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia. These plants are often valued for their ornamental qualities and traditional medicinal uses."
