    "intro": "Cylindropuntia imbricata subsp. lloydii, commonly known as the Lloyd's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, spiny areoles, which are specialized structures for hosting the plant's defensive spines. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by various insects and birds. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in arid environments. This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
