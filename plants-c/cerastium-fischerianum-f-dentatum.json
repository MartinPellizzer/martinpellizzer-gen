    "intro": "Cerastium fischerianum f. dentatum, commonly known as the toothed mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, white flowers. The leaves are typically oval to linear, with a distinctive serrated or toothed margin, giving the plant its specific epithet. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its spread through wind dispersal."
