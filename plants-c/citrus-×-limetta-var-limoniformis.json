    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 limetta var. limoniformis, commonly known as the finger lime, is a unique citrus hybrid native to Australia. It is characterized by its elongated, finger-like fruits that are typically 2\u20135 cm in length. The fruit's exterior is covered in a rough, bumpy skin, which turns from green to yellow as it matures. Inside, it contains hundreds of tiny, translucent, jelly-like vesicles filled with a tangy, citrus-flavored juice. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and used in culinary applications due to its distinctive flavor and appearance."
