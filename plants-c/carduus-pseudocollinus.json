    "intro": "Carduus pseudocollinus, commonly known as the lesser thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its leaves are spiny and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in a dense, spherical cluster. Carduus pseudocollinus is often considered a weed but can serve as a food source for certain insects and livestock."
