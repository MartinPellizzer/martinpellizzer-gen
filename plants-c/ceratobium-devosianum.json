    "intro": "Ceratobium devosianum, commonly known as the moss campion, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are typically linear and grass-like, and it produces a compact rosette of foliage. Ceratobium devosianum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
