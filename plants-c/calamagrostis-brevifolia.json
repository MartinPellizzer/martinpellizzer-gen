    "intro": "Calamagrostis brevifolia, commonly known as the shortleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments. Calamagrostis brevifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and adaptability."
