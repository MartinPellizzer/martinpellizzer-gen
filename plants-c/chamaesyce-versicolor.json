    "intro": "Chamaesyce versicolor, commonly known as the variable sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers. Its botanical name reflects its variable coloration and the presence of a mat-like growth habit. Chamaesyce versicolor is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
