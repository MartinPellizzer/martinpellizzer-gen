    "intro": "Colchicum szovitsii var. bifolium, commonly known as the two-leaved autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Carpathians. It features striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has basal leaves that are usually divided into two lobes, giving it its varietal name \"bifolium.\" It produces toxic, spindle-shaped corms that are used in traditional medicine but require careful handling. This species is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler, humid environments."
