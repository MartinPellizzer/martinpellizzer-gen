    "intro": "Carex tripartita, commonly known as the three-part sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes grass-like plants known for their distinctive three-part leaf structure. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in three ranks, a characteristic feature of the sedge family. Carex tripartita produces small, clustered flower spikes that bloom in the summer, contributing to its ecological importance as a habitat for various invertebrates."
