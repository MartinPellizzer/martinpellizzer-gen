    "intro": "Conostegia centrosperma, commonly known as the silverleaf cactus, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a compact, branching structure with dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, reducing water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding ornamental value to its drought-tolerant form. Its leaves are modified into spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce transpiration. Conostegia centrosperma is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
