    "intro": "Chaenocephalus, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. These plants are shrubs or small trees characterized by their dense, compact growth habit and showy yellow flowers. The leaves are typically small,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. Chaenocephalus species are often found in rocky or arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with their water-storing tissues. Their flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to their ecological significance in their native habitats."
