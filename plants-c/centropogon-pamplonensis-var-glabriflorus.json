    "intro": "Centropogon pamplonensis var. glabriflorus, commonly known as the Pamplona lily, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to the cool, moist climates of its native habitat. Its flowers are usually pale blue or purple, and it produces small, grass-like leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
