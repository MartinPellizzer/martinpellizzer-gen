    "intro": "Cardamine smithiana, commonly known as Smith's watercress, is a small perennial herb native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous plants. The plant has slender, branching stems that grow close to the ground, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often slightly hairy. Small white flowers with four petals appear in early spring, followed by elongated siliques containing numerous tiny seeds. It is often found in rocky streambeds and along forested stream banks, where it thrives in cool, wet conditions."
