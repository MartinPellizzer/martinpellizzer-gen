    "intro": "Crocus insularis var. major, commonly known as the large island crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color, often with a distinctive purple or violet tinge at the base. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its bulbs are relatively hardy and can survive mild frosts, though they may require a period of cold dormancy to bloom successfully. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its early spring blossoms."
