    "intro": "Cleisocentron abasii, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact rosette of velvety, waxy leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, often with a distinctive yellow or orange throat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cleisocentron abasii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
