    "intro": "Cyperus chromatolepis, commonly known as the golden flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along waterways, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often yellow or golden in color. Cyperus chromatolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
