    "intro": "Chalybea occidentalis, commonly known as the western ironwood, is a woody shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark blue to black berries. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils. Chalybea occidentalis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
