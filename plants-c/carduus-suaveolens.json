    "intro": "Carduus suaveolens, commonly known as sweet everlasting, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers have a subtle, sweet fragrance. Sweet everlasting is often used in dried floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms and aromatic properties."
