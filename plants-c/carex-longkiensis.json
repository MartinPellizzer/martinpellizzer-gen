    "intro": "Carex longkiensis, commonly known as the longkiensis sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to China and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wet meadows. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens."
