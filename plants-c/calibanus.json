    "intro": "Calibanus, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to the Americas. The plants typically have basal leaves that are either linear or lance-shaped, and they produce yellow flowers that are clustered in a head. Calibanus species are often found in dry, open habitats such as fields and roadsides. They are generally herbaceous and can be annual or perennial depending on the species."
