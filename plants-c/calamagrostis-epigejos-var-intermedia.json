    "intro": "Calamagrostis epigejos var. intermedia, commonly known as the silver feather reed grass, is a tall, ornamental grass native to the eastern United States. It features slender, silver-blue blades that are often tinged with white at the tips, creating a striking visual effect in gardens. The plant produces feathery, plume-like inflorescences that add movement and texture during the growing season. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soils. This variety is prized for its drought tolerance and ability to form dense clumps over time."
