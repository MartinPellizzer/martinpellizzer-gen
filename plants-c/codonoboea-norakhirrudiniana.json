    "intro": "Codonoboea norakhirrudiniana, commonly known as the Norakhirrudin's codonopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with prominent yellow markings. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, thriving in humid tropical climates. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, while its stems are slender and branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
