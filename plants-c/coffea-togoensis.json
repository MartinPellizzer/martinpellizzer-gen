    "intro": "Coffea togoensis, commonly known as Togo coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to West Africa, particularly found in countries like Togo, Ghana, and Nigeria. The plant produces small, red berries that contain seeds used for coffee production. It is notable for its unique flavor profile and lower caffeine content compared to other coffee species. Due to its limited cultivation, it is considered a rare and less commonly available coffee variety."
