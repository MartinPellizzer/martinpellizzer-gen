    "intro": "Cerasus avium var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved sweet cherry, is a variant of the sweet cherry tree native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The fruit is typically smaller than standard sweet cherries and has a sweet, juicy pulp with a mild flavor. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as for its edible fruit. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for temperate climates."
