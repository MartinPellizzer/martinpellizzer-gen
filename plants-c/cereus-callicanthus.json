    "intro": "Cereus callicanthus, commonly known as the red-tipped cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom at night. These flowers are adapted for pollination by nocturnal insects such as moths. Cereus callicanthus is a succulent plant, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in arid environments."
