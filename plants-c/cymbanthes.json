    "intro": "Cymbanthes, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Campanulaceae. These plants are characterized by their bell-shaped, tubular flowers that often display vibrant colors such as blue, purple, or white. They typically grow in moist, shady environments, such as woodlands and stream banks, across parts of Europe and Asia. Cymbanthes species are perennial herbs with lance-shaped leaves and showy inflorescences that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Their botanical features make them popular in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
