    "intro": "Coccoloba alagoensis var. major, commonly known as the Alagoas coccoloba, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is a shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the island of Saint Lucia. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it is adapted to coastal and limestone soils. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences."
