    "intro": "Conomorpha, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, lace-like fronds that give them a ghostly appearance. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Conomorpha species are often found in temperate regions and are valued for their ornamental beauty. Their reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
