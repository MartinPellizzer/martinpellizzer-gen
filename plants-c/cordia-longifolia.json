    "intro": "Cordia longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf cordia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often lance-shaped leaves that are typically glabrous. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive, fleshy, orange-red berries that are edible for some animals. Cordia longifolia is often found in coastal areas and can thrive in saline or brackish conditions. Its ecological importance includes providing food for wildlife and contributing to coastal vegetation stability."
