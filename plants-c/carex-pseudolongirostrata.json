It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, cylindrical leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering stems bear small, three-ranked spikelets, which contain both male and female flowers.
