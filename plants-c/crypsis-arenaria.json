    "intro": "Crypsis arenaria, commonly known as the sand crypts, is a flowering plant native to sandy coastal regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, pale green leaves that help it blend into its arid environment. The plant produces delicate, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
