    "intro": "Cota melanoloma, commonly known as the blackleaf cota, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are dark green and often have a slightly hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in arid environments. Cota melanoloma is typically found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
