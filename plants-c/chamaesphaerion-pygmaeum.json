    "intro": "Chamaesphaerion pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf rock cress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in dry, sunny habitats. The plant has compact, cushion-like growth habits, with small, alternate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters and appearing in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
