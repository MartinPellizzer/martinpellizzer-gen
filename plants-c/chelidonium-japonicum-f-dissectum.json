    "intro": "Chelidonium japonicum f. dissectum, commonly known as the Japanese greater celandine variegated form, is a variant of the greater celandine plant. It is a perennial herb native to Japan, characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that are often deeply dissected, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by reddish-brown capsules containing the seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
