It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with small, narrow leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces tiny, fiery red or orange fruits that are often used in traditional cuisines for their intense heat. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and is relatively drought-tolerant. Its botanical features make it well-suited for container gardening and small-space cultivation."
