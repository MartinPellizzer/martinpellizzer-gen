    "intro": "Cytinus hypocistis var. ochraceus, commonly known as the ochraceous broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of legumes. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, reddish stems and its unique, umbrella-like inflorescence that bears small, yellowish flowers. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in dry, rocky soils. Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
