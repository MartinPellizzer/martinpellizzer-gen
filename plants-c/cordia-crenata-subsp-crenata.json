    "intro": "Cordia crenata subsp. crenata, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It has smooth, greyish-brown bark and simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves with wavy margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spherical capsules containing numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas and is valued for its hard, durable wood. The species is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
