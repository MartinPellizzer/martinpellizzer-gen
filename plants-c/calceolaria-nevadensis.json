    "intro": "Calceolaria nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky soils and open meadows. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
