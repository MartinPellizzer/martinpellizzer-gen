It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by dry, three-lobed seed capsules. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. This species is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil."
