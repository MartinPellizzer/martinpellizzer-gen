    "intro": "Chaetocarpus coriaceus, commonly known as the rough sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Atlantic. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its tough, woody stems and fleshy, spiny leaves. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to harsh coastal environments. Chaetocarpus coriaceus is often found growing on rocky shores and sandy beaches, where it plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
