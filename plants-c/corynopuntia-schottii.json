    "intro": "Corynopuntia schottii, commonly known as the Schott's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its robust, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open landscapes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in warm climates."
