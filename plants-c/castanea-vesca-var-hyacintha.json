    "intro": "Castanea vesca var. hyacintha, commonly known as the hyacinth chestnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It produces small, edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks, similar to other members of the chestnut genus. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slight pubescence. The flowers are typically pale green to reddish, and the fruit ripens in late summer to early autumn. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in horticulture."
