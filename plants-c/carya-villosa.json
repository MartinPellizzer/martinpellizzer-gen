    "intro": "Carya villosa, commonly known as the silky walnut, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its rough, hairy bark and large, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by hard, spiny fruits that mature in the fall. Its nuts are encased in a thick, woody husk and are often used in traditional medicine. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
