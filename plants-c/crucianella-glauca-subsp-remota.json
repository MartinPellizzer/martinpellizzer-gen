    "intro": "Crucianella glauca subsp. remota, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are bladder-like and can inflate with air, a feature that aids in buoyancy and seed dispersal. The species is adapted to saline and windy environments, making it a characteristic component of coastal flora."
