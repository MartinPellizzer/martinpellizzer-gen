The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often mistaken for willow leaves, giving it its scientific name. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Cestrum salicifolium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in warm climates."
