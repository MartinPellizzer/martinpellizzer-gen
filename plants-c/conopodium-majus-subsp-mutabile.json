    "intro": "Conopodium majus subsp. mutabile, commonly known as the variable bladderpod, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated pods that resemble bladders, which are used for seed dispersal. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It has small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes. The subspecies mutabile is notable for its variability in leaf and pod morphology, contributing to its common name."
