    "intro": "Cyathea rigens, commonly known as the rigid tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in favorable conditions. Its rhizome system supports the development of its woody trunk, which is covered in a layer of dead fronds. Cyathea rigens is often found in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appearance."
