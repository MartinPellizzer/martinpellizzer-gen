    "intro": "Centaurea coerulescens subsp. muretii, commonly known as the bluehead centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in dry or sunny environments. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
