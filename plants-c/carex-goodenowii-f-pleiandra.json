    "intro": "Carex goodenowii f. pleiandra, commonly known as the broad-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. This variety is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to other forms of Carex goodenowii."
