    "intro": "Convolvulus malvaeoides, commonly known as the Malva-like bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing habit, with slender stems that can twine around supports. The plant produces showy, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, often with five lobes. Its leaves are heart-shaped and hairy, and it thrives in well-drained soils in temperate climates. It is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
