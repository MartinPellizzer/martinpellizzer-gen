    "intro": "Carex phyllocephala, commonly known as the broad-leaf sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and somewhat broad at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are typically found in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Carex phyllocephala plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
