    "intro": "Calanthe elmeri, commonly known as the Elmer's calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It features a compact, sympodial growth habit with a pseudobulb that supports its foliage and flowers. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a distinctive red or purple lip. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calanthe elmeri is considered a conservation concern."
