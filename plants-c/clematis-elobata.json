It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 15 feet, allowing it to climb and trail over structures. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. Clematis elobata prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental vines."
