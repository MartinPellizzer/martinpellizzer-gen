    "intro": "Cheirostylis pubescens, commonly known as the hairy-styled orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, hairy column. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
