    "intro": "Celastrus buxifolius, commonly known as the boxleaf staff vine, is a woody climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves that resemble those of boxwood, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique foliage and climbing habit make it a distinctive component of its ecological habitat."
