    "intro": "Costus cylindricus, commonly known as the narrowleaf costus, is a tropical herbaceous plant native to Central and South America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Costus cylindricus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
