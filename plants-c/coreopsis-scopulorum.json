    "intro": "Coreopsis scopulorum, commonly known as rock coreopsis, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its narrow, linear leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, and it is often found in dry, gravelly habitats. Coreopsis scopulorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
