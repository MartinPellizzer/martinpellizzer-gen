    "intro": "Campanula oreadum, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, while its stems are usually covered in a fine pubescence. Campanula oreadum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
