    "intro": "Cymbopogon plurinodis, commonly known as the nodding grass or sweet grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a distinct grassy aroma. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often nodding, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Cymbopogon plurinodis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
