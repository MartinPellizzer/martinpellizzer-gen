    "intro": "Coussarea insolita, commonly known as the rare and striking mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 cm in diameter, with a distinctive red or purple coloration. The plant has a woody stem and is often found growing in shaded, moist environments within tropical forests. Its leaves are typically elliptical and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, Coussarea insolita is considered a rare and endangered species."
