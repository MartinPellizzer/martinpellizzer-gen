    "intro": "Cusparia ovata, commonly known as the oval spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are oval in shape and often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it adaptable to arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
