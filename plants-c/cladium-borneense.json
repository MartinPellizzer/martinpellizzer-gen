    "intro": "Cladium borneense, commonly known as Bornean sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and swampy areas of Borneo. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in waterlogged soils and is often found in mangrove ecosystems. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the soil and prevent erosion. Cladium borneense plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
