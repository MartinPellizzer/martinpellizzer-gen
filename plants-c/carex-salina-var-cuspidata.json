    "intro": "Carex salina var. cuspidata, commonly known as salt marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically grayish-green and coated with a waxy layer to resist salt spray. The plant produces small, greenish-brown spikes of flowers that are clustered at the ends of its stems. It thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. This variety is notable for its ability to tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
