    "intro": "Cousinia lurorum, commonly known as the alpine cudweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cousinia lurorum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species in alpine ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical research."
