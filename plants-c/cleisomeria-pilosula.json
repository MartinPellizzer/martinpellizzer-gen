    "intro": "Cleisomeria pilosula, commonly known as the silky cleisomeria, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically pink or purple and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cleisomeria pilosula is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems."
