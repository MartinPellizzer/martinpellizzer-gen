    "intro": "Campyloneurum cochense, commonly known as the Brazilian fern or golden fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, golden hairs. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the spores are released during the dry season. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in its native habitat."
