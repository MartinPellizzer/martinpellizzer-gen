    "intro": "Cyperus leptophyllus, commonly known as narrow-leaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. It produces small, clustered flowers that are often hidden among the foliage, and it is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Cyperus leptophyllus is also valued for its ornamental appeal in aquatic gardens."
