    "intro": "Cissus pallidiflora, commonly known as the pale-flowered grape ivy, is a climbing vine native to southern Africa. It features heart-shaped, pale green leaves with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Its trailing growth habit makes it popular for hanging baskets and as a decorative indoor plant."
