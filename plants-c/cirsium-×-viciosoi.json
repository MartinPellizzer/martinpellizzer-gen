It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, often thriving in disturbed soils. It is commonly found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its prickly nature, it is often considered a weed but also serves as a habitat for various insects and birds."
