    "intro": "Carduncellus caeruleus subsp. tingitanus, commonly known as the Canary Island thistle, is a perennial shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in rocky, coastal environments and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in coastal scrub and maquis vegetation. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
