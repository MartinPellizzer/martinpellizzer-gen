    "intro": "Cereus jamacaru var. glaucus, commonly known as the Blue Cereus, is a cactus species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in arid conditions. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
