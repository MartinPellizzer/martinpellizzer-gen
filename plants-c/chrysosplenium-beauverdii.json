    "intro": "Chrysosplenium beauverdii, commonly known as the yellow bugleweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shady environments. Chrysosplenium beauverdii is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
