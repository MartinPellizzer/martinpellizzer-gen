    "intro": "Caragana tenuis, commonly known as the slender peashrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and parts of the Middle East. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, followed by pea-like pods that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Caragana tenuis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
