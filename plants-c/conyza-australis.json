    "intro": "Conyza australis, commonly known as the common cudweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Australia. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. The plant has small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom from spring to autumn, and its leaves are usually hairy and alternate. Conyza australis is characterized by its slender stems and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. It is considered a weed in some regions but also serves as a food source for certain insects and livestock."
