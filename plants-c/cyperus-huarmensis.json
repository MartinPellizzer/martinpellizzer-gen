    "intro": "Cyperus huarmensis, commonly known as the Huarm\u00e9nsis flatsedge, is a member of the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. Native to Central America, particularly Mexico, it thrives in wetland and marshy environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation in suitable habitats."
