    "intro": "Chrysosplenium rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaved chrysosplenium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features rounded, leathery leaves that are often arranged in a basal rosette, with a distinctive silver or grayish pubescence on the upper surface. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers appear in clusters during the spring and are borne on slender, erect stems. Chrysosplenium rotundifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shady garden settings for its unique foliage and delicate floral display."
