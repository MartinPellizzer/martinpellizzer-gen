    "intro": "Cardamine callitrichoides, commonly known as the creeping watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to moist, temperate regions. It typically grows in shady, wet environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a smooth, glossy surface and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. The plant is often found in calcareous soils and is considered a valuable indicator species for wetland habitats."
