    "intro": "Cerastium praecox, commonly known as early whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant is typically less than 20 cm tall, with a compact growth habit that makes it well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and flies, contributing to its ecological significance."
