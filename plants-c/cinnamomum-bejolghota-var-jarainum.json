    "intro": "Cinnamomum bejolghota var. jarainum, commonly known as Jaraini cinnamon, is a lesser-known variant of the cinnamon plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Its bark and leaves are used in traditional medicine for their antimicrobial and antifungal properties. Despite its potential, it remains underutilized compared to more common cinnamon species."
