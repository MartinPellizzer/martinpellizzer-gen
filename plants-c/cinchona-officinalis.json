    "intro": "Cinchona officinalis, commonly known as the quinine tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain seeds, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its most notable feature is the bark, which contains the alkaloid quinine, historically used to treat malaria. This plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has cultural significance in traditional medicine."
