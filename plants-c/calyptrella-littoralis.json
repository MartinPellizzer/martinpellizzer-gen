    "intro": "Calyptrella littoralis, commonly known as the coastal lichen, is a unique lichen species that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form, which helps it retain moisture in harsh, salty conditions. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, enabling it to survive in nutrient-poor substrates. It is often found on rocks, soil, or dead wood near the shoreline. Due to its specialized habitat, Calyptrella littoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
