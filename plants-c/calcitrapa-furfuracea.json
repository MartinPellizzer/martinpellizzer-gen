    "intro": "Calcitrapa furfuracea, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface. Calcitrapa furfuracea is a carnivorous plant, relying on its specialized bladders for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments."
