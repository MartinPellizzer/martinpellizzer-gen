    "intro": "Cheilanthes deltoidea subsp. silicicola, commonly known as the silicicola shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, compact fern that typically grows on rocky substrates, often in crevices or on limestone. The plant is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silica, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. It produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds, and it is generally dioecious, with separate male and female plants. This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme temperatures."
