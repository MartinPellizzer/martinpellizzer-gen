    "intro": "Calyptrospermum trifidum, commonly known as the three-lobed ironwood, is a perennial shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and trifid (three-lobed) leaves that are often covered in fine, whitish hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed fruits. Its leaves and stems contain high levels of tannins, making it useful in traditional medicine and as a natural dye source. Calyptrospermum trifidum is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and tropical regions."
