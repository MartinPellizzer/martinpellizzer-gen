    "intro": "Clerodendrum, commonly known as the \"flowering bush\" or \"cigar plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae. It is characterized by its showy, often tubular or clustered flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, pink, and white. The leaves are typically opposite, simple, and can be either lance-shaped or ovate, depending on the species. Many species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Clerodendrum plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
