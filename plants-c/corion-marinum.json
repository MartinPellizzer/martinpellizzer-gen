    "intro": "Corion marinum, commonly known as the sea corion, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to coastal environments. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in tidal zones where it withstands periodic saltwater immersion. The plant has a compact, succulent structure with thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are small and typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters that attract pollinators like bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Corion marinum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
