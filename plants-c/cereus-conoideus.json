    "intro": "Cereus conoideus, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night and remain open for only one night. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. Cereus conoideus is adapted to arid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking nocturnal blooms."
