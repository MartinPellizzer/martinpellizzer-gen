    "intro": "Comocladia palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the western United States. It is a member of the Goodeniaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in salty, well-drained conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, white coating that helps reduce water loss. Comocladia palmeri is an important plant for coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
