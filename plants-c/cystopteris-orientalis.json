It typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant in the substrate. Cystopteris orientalis is known for its delicate appearance and is often used in ornamental water gardens."
