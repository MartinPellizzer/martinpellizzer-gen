    "intro": "Cyrtomium coriaceum, commonly known as the tough fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are dark green and often have a glossy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies. Cyrtomium coriaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy and attractive foliage."
