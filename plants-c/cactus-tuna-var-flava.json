    "intro": "Cactus tuna var. flava, commonly known as the yellow cactus tuna, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant's leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. The yellow flowers, which bloom in spring, attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
