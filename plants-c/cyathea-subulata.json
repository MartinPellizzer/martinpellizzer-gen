    "intro": "Cyathea subulata, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant grows in humid, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators. Cyathea subulata plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
