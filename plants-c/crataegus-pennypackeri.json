    "intro": "Crataegus pennypackeri, commonly known as Pennypacker hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but generally considered tart. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
