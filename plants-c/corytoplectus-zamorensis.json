It is a marine gastropod mollusk that typically inhabits shallow coastal waters. The shell of this species is characterized by its conical shape and a smooth, glossy surface. It is found primarily in the eastern Pacific Ocean, ranging from California to southern Mexico. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and less studied species."
