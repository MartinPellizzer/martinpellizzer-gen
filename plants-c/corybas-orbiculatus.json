    "intro": "Corybas orbiculatus, commonly known as the orbicular helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, helmet-shaped floral structure, which is typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces a single, showy flower that blooms in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The orchid's unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
