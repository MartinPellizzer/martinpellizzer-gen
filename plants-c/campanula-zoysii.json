It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy, and it thrives in well-drained soils with full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Campanula zoysii is also noted for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
