    "intro": "Calligonum tenue var. rigidopterum, commonly known as the rigidleaf sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and gray-green, rigidly upright leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high salinity and low precipitation. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy and saline soils."
