    "intro": "Chaptalia cipoensis, commonly known as the Cipo mountain chaptalia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and often aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry climates. The small yellow flowers appear in clusters, contributing to its role in local ecosystems and potentially its use in traditional medicine."
