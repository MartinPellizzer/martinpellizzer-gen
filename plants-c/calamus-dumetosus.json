    "intro": "Calamus dumetosus, commonly known as the marsh reed or dwarf calamus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia, including regions of India, China, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and narrow, grass-like leaves that often form dense mats. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, a common feature among arum family plants. Calamus dumetosus is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities in aquatic and bog garden settings."
