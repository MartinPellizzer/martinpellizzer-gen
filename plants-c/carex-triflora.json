    "intro": "Carex triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants commonly found in wet or moist environments. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that develop in spikelets. It thrives in shady, damp areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form extensive colonies, making it a common component of wetland ecosystems."
