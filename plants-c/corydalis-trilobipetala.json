    "intro": "Corydalis trilobipetala, commonly known as the three-lobed larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from blue to purple. The plant has slender, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves with three distinct lobes, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and study."
