    "intro": "Commiphora tephrodes, commonly known as the African myrrh, is a small evergreen shrub native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap, which has been used traditionally for medicinal and incense purposes. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, leathery leaves. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it produces small, woody fruits containing a single seed. The resin exuded from its bark is a key botanical feature, contributing to its historical and cultural significance."
