    "intro": "Ctenodon priscoanus, commonly known as the ancient spiny scale, is a rare and enigmatic plant species characterized by its unique morphological features. It possesses a robust, spiny stem covered in dense, overlapping scales that provide protection against herbivory and environmental stress. The plant exhibits a succulent habit, storing water in its thickened stems to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often reduced, adapting to minimize water loss. Despite its botanical intrigue, Ctenodon priscoanus remains poorly understood due to its limited distribution and scarcity in the wild."
