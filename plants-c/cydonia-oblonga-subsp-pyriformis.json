    "intro": "Cydonia oblonga subsp. pyriformis, commonly known as the Persian apple or white damson, is a subspecies of the quince that exhibits distinct botanical features. It is characterized by its ovate, yellowish-green leaves and fragrant, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The fruit is typically oval or pear-shaped, with a thick, rugged skin that turns from green to yellow or orange as it ripens. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in autumn, and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit, which is used in jams and jellies."
