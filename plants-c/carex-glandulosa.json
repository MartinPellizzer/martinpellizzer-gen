    "intro": "Carex glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its flowering heads consist of small, spike-like clusters of greenish flowers that develop into three-lobed, spiky fruits. Carex glandulosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
