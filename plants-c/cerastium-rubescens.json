    "intro": "Cerastium rubescens, commonly known as red sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered with fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Cerastium rubescens thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas."
