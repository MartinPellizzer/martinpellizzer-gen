    "intro": "Conyza prostrata, commonly known as common sandmat, is a low-growing annual herb native to Africa and parts of Asia. It has a sprawling, mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender, hairy stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are typically oval or lance-shaped, with hairy surfaces and serrated edges. Conyza prostrata is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments."
