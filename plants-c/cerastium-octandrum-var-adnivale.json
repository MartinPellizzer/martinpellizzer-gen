    "intro": "Cerastium octandrum var. adnivale, commonly known as the alpine chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along mountain trails. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand cold temperatures make it a resilient member of alpine flora."
