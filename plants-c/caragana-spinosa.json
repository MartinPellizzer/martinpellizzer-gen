    "intro": "Caragana spinosa, commonly known as the thorned shrub or Siberian peashrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by pea-like pods containing several seeds. Caragana spinosa is adapted to harsh climates and is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils."
