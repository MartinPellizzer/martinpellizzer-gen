    "intro": "Cestrum amictum f. paranense, commonly known as the Paran\u00e1 nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries, which are toxic to humans and animals, mature to a red color and are often used in traditional medicine, though with caution. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats."
