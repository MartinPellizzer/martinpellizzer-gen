    "intro": "Caroxylon dendroides, commonly known as the desert tree or desert shrub, is a resilient plant adapted to arid environments. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are often inconspicuous, followed by dry, capsule-like fruits. Caroxylon dendroides is known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. Its root system is extensive, helping it to anchor in sandy soils and access deep underground water sources."
