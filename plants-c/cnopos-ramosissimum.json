    "intro": "Cnopos ramosissimum, commonly known as the branched milkweed, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite leaves that are typically oval in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale yellow or greenish in color. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Cnopos ramosissimum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
