    "intro": "Coppensia chrysothyrsus, commonly known as the golden thorn, is a unique plant native to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, spiny growth and striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly the Rodrigues fruit bat, which plays a crucial role in its reproductive cycle. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Coppensia chrysothyrsus is considered a rare and endangered species."
