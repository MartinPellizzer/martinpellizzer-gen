    "intro": "Capsicum annuum f. pendulum, commonly known as the hanging pepper plant, is a botanical variant of the common chili pepper. It is characterized by its unique, cascading growth habit, with long, drooping stems that produce clusters of small, vibrant red fruits. This variety thrives in warm, sunny conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The fruits are typically harvested when fully matured, offering a mild to medium heat level. Its ornamental appeal makes it a popular choice for both culinary use and garden decoration."
