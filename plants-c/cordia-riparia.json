    "intro": "Cordia riparia, commonly known as the white cedar or river cedar, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries that contain several seeds. Cordia riparia is often found growing near water sources, such as rivers and wetlands, due to its preference for moist, well-drained soils. It has a slow growth rate and is valued for its durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
