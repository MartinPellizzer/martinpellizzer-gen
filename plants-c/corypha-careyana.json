    "intro": "Corypha careyana, commonly known as the giant palm or coconut palm, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 6 meters. The plant produces large, clustered inflorescences with yellow flowers, which eventually develop into the familiar coconut fruits. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize coastal soils, making it valuable for erosion control. Corypha careyana is also cultivated for its ornamental value and economic importance due to its fruit and palm oil."
