    "intro": "Crescentia coriacea, commonly known as the sweet sop or custard apple, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by the edible, spiky fruit. The fruit has a thick, leathery exterior and a creamy, aromatic pulp with a sweet, custard-like flavor. It is valued both for its fruit and its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
