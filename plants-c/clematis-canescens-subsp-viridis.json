    "intro": "Clematis canescens subsp. viridis, commonly known as the green-hairy clematis, is a climbing vine native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, greenish hairs. The flowers are typically white or pale blue, with five sepals and no true petals, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, ornamental vine. This subspecies is often used in landscaping for its ability to climb and cover trellises or fences effectively."
