    "intro": "Casuarina poissoniana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical habit and needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. Casuarina poissoniana thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and inland heathlands. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
