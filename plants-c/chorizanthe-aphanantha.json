It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden among the foliage. The plant produces tiny, spiny fruits that contain minute seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Its botanical features reflect adaptations to harsh, dry conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
