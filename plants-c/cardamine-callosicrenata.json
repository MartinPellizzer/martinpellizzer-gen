    "intro": "Cardamine callosicrenata, commonly known as the roughleaf watercress, is a small perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves, which are covered in a distinctive layer of fine, rough hairs. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
