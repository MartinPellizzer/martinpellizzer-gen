    "intro": "Colchicum walteri, commonly known as the Walter's autumn crocus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem that bears a single, showy flower with three sepals and three petals. Its bulbs, which are its primary storage organs, are toxic and contain the alkaloid colchicine. Colchicum walteri thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats."
