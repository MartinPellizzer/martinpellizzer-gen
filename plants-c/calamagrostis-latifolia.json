    "intro": "Calamagrostis latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf reed, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and wide, flat leaves that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in wet or moist soil conditions, often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
