    "intro": "Campyloneurum nitidissimum var. nitidissimum, commonly known as the shining fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a glossy, waxy surface that reflects light, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with numerous adventitious roots that anchor it to tree trunks or branches. Its fronds are typically 30\u201360 cm long and are divided into narrow, serrated segments. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary rainforests."
