    "intro": "Conyza oligocephala, commonly known as the \"littlehead cudweed,\" is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is an annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant features small, yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Conyza oligocephala is often found in fields, roadsides, and other sunny areas where it can thrive with minimal competition."
