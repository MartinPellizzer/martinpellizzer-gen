    "intro": "Cerasus acuminata, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or Prunus japonica, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lanceolate, serrated leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, dark red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Cerasus acuminata is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
