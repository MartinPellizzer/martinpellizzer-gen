    "intro": "Chamaecrista glandulosa var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular ticktree, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, glandular dots and its striking clusters of yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its seed pods are elongated and contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It plays a role in ecological systems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
