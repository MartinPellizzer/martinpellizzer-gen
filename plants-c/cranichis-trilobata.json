    "intro": "Cranichis trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, erect stem and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose spike, which are typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in pine flatwoods and wetlands. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
