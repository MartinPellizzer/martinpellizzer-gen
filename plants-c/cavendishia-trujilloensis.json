    "intro": "Cavendishia trujilloensis, commonly known as the Trujilloensis Cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, adapted to its arid environment. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
