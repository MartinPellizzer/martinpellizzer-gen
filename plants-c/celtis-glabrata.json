    "intro": "Celtis glabrata, commonly known as the smooth hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by spherical, green berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color. These berries are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally not considered palatable to humans. Celtis glabrata is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and disturbed sites, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
