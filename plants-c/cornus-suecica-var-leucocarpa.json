It is characterized by its white or pale yellow berries that contrast with its dark green leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by the distinctive berries. The leaves are elliptical and have a smooth texture, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
