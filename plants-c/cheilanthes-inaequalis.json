    "intro": "Cheilanthes inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky soils and crevices, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
