    "intro": "Chabraea salinae var. bipinnatifida, commonly known as the saltbush or coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and its ability to thrive in saline and arid environments. The plant has bipinnately compound leaves, which are adapted to reduce water loss and withstand strong coastal winds. It produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
