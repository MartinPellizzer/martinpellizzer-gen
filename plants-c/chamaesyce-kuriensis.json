    "intro": "Chamaesyce kuriensis, commonly known as the Kuriensis sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss through transpiration. Chamaesyce kuriensis is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open fields."
