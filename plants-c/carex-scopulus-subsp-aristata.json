    "intro": "Carex scopulus subsp. aristata, commonly known as the arrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a tight, cylindrical cluster. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation in suitable habitats."
