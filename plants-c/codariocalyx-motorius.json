    "intro": "Codariocalyx motorius, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Botanically, it belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
