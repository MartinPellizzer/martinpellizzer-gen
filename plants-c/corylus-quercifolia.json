    "intro": "Corylus quercifolia, commonly known as the acorn chestnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which resemble those of oaks, and its distinctive, spiny husks that enclose the edible nuts. The plant produces both male and female flowers on the same individual, with the female flowers developing into the characteristic acorns. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and streamside areas."
