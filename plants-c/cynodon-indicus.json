    "intro": "Cynodon indicus, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense growth habit, making it highly resilient to drought and heat. The plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions and withstand grazing. It is widely used for turfgrass in warm climates due to its low maintenance requirements. Additionally, it plays an important ecological role in preventing soil erosion and supporting local wildlife."
