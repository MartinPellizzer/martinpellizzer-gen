    "intro": "Conioselinum chinense var. anticostense, commonly known as the Anticostan Chinese wormwood, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Anticosta in the Philippines. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic, often finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which contribute to its distinctive texture and aid in moisture retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
