    "intro": "Cousinia birandiana, commonly known as the Persian saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Cousinia birandiana is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude conditions."
