    "intro": "Carex alpina var. lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is a common species in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
