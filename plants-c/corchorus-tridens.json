    "intro": "Corchorus tridens, commonly known as the prickly burr or sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive, three-lobed, spiny seed pods. Its fibrous roots and drought-resistant nature make it well adapted to sandy soils. Corchorus tridens is also valued for its edible leaves and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
