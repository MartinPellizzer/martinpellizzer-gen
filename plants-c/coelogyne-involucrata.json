It is characterized by its striking yellow and green floral colors, with long, slender petals and a distinctive yellow lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often appearing in the late winter or early spring. Coelogyne involucrata is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural significance in traditional medicine."
