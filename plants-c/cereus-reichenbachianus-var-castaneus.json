    "intro": "Cereus reichenbachianus var. castaneus, commonly known as the red-tipped cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that often grow in a branched, tree-like form. The plant produces striking, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically red or orange in color, which bloom at night. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. This variety is popular among cactus enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
