    "intro": "Carduus nikitinii, commonly known as the Russian thistle or tansy, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, leafy stems and composite flowers that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant is native to Europe and Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in dry, open habitats. The leaves are typically grayish-green with a woolly texture, and the plant produces seeds that are dispersed by wind."
