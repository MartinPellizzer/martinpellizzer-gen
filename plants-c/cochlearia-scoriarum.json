    "intro": "Cochlearia scoriarum, commonly known as the Scottish cochlearia, is a flowering plant native to the British Isles. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to harsh, windy conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in early summer. The leaves are succulent and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat."
