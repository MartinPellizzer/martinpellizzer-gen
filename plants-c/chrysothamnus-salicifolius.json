    "intro": "Chrysothamnus salicifolius, commonly known as yellow rabbitbrush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with lance-shaped leaves that are similar in appearance to willow leaves. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats. Yellow rabbitbrush is adapted to poor soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant in harsh climates."
