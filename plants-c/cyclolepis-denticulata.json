    "intro": "Cyclolepis denticulata, commonly known as the African rock fig, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, green, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, round, green fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Cyclolepis denticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
