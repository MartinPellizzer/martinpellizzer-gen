    "intro": "Conomorpha leprosa, commonly known as the leprose conomorpha, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
