    "intro": "Carpoceras, commonly known as the \"skeleton flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique, papery bracts that resemble the skeletal structure of a flower, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, where it has adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Carpoceras species often have small, inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by showy, modified leaves. These plants are of interest to botanists due to their specialized morphology and ecological adaptations."
