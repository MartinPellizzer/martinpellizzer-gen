    "intro": "Chrysosplenium grayanum var. nipponicum, commonly known as the Japanese golden spleenwort, is a rare and delicate member of the Saxifragaceae family. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or silver hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions of Japan. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
