    "intro": "Cabralea silvatica, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or Brazilian cherry, is a deciduous tree native to Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically used in musical instruments and furniture. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
