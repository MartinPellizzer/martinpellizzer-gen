    "intro": "Cucumis melo var. succosus, commonly known as the Persian cucumber, is a cultivated variant of the melon genus. It is characterized by its long, slender, and often ribbed fruit, which can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces pale yellow flowers and has a trailing growth habit, making it suitable for trellising or ground cultivation. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. The fruit is typically harvested when it reaches a mature green color, though some varieties may turn orange or red when fully ripe."
