    "intro": "Callistachys drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's honeysuckle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its woody stems are typically covered in a rough, bark-like texture, providing structural support in its harsh habitat. The species is well-suited for drought-tolerant landscaping due to its resilience and low maintenance requirements."
