    "intro": "Croton desertorum, commonly known as the desert croton, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its bark and leaves contain various bioactive compounds, making it of interest in traditional medicine. Croton desertorum is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can endure prolonged drought periods."
