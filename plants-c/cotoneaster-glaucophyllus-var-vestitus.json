    "intro": "Cotoneaster glaucophyllus var. vestitus, commonly known as the silver-leaf cotoneaster, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and its distinctive silvery-white undersides on the leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, red berries that are attractive to birds, contributing to its ecological value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for ornamental gardening. Its hardy nature and showy winter foliage make it a popular plant in temperate climates."
