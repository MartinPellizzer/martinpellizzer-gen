    "intro": "Cryptocarya tannaensis, commonly known as Tanna cryptomeria, is a species of evergreen tree native to the island of Tanna in Vanuatu. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, lowland rainforests, reaching heights of up to 20 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a glossy surface, while its fruits are small, woody drupes. Due to its restricted range and habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
