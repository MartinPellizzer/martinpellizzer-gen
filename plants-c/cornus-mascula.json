    "intro": "Cornus mascula, commonly known as the male dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and turn yellow in the fall. Cornus mascula is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland settings."
