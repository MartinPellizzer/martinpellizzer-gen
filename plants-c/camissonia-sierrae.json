It typically features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny areas of mountainous regions. Camissonia sierrae is an example of a plant adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments."
