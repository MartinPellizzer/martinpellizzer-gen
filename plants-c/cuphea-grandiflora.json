    "intro": "Cuphea grandiflora, commonly known as the \"whispering bells,\" is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, tubular, pink to red flowers that resemble small bells, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower due to its long-lasting blooms. Cuphea grandiflora is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees."
