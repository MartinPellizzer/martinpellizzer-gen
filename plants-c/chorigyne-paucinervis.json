    "intro": "Chorigyne paucinervis, commonly known as the slender-leaved chorigyne, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
