    "intro": "Chaetochlamys callichlamys, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically dark green and strap-like, while the inflorescence bears clustered, star-shaped blooms. This species is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant."
