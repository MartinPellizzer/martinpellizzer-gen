    "intro": "Cyperus clelandii, commonly known as the Australian sedgeland, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. Its slender, grass-like stems are often clustered, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Cyperus clelandii is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality in wetland ecosystems."
