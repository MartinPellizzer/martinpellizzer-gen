    "intro": "Ceraia patentiloba, commonly known as the slender ceraia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with long, narrow leaflets that give it a distinctive appearance. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
