    "intro": "Carpoceras hastulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and can remain viable in the soil for several years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants."
