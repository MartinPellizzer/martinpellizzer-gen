    "intro": "Chamaecyparis obtusa var. similofacifera, commonly known as the Japanese false cypress, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to Japan. It features a compact, pyramidal shape with scale-like leaves that are a deep green on top and silver-white underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and as a foundation plant in landscape designs."
