    "intro": "Cydonia oblonga var. pomiformis, commonly known as the quince, is a deciduous fruit tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces a fragrant, yellowish fruit that ripens in late summer to early autumn. The plant has a rough, fissured bark and alternate, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated edge. Its flowers are pale yellow and appear in clusters, often before the leaves. The fruit is typically used in cooking, baking, and making jams due to its high pectin content."
