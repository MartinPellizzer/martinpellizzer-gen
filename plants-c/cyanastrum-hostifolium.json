    "intro": "Cyanastrum hostifolium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves that are typically green with a faint blue or purple hue. The plant produces small, delicate white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, often in shaded, humid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
