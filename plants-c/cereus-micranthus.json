    "intro": "Cereus micranthus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a tall, columnar plant with a ribbed stem and spines that help protect it from herbivores. The plant produces striking, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a single night. Cereus micranthus is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts."
