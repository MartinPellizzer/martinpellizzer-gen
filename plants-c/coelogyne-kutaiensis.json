    "intro": "Coelogyne kutaiensis, commonly known as the Kutai orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the lowland rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer, featuring a complex arrangement of petals and sepals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Coelogyne kutaiensis is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
