    "intro": "Chelidonium hybridum, commonly known as the hybrid greater celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, and it produces a milky sap that contains alkaloids. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
