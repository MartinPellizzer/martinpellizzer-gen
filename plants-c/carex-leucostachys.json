    "intro": "Carex leucostachys, commonly known as white-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of white to pale green flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Carex leucostachys is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
