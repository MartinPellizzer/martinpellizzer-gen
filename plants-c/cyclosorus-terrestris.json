    "intro": "Cyclosorus terrestris, commonly known as the ground liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid body composed of a flattened, ribbon-like structure that is covered in small, leaf-like structures called phyllodes. Cyclosorus terrestris reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called soridia located on the thallus. Its simple morphology and preference for humid habitats make it an important indicator species for assessing environmental conditions in temperate and tropical regions."
