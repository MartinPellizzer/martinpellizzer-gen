    "intro": "Candollea rhynchocarpa, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, horn-like structures on its floral bracts, which give it its common name. Native to the Andean regions of South America, this plant thrives in high-altitude cloud forests. It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often blooming during the cooler months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Candollea rhynchocarpa is considered a rare and endangered species."
