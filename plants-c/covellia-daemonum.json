    "intro": "Covellia daemonum, commonly known as the Shadowroot, is a rare and enigmatic plant found in the dense, mist-shrouded forests of the northern highlands. Its leaves are a deep, iridescent black, which absorb and store ambient light, allowing it to thrive in low-light conditions. The plant produces a bioluminescent flower at night, emitting a faint, eerie glow that attracts specific nocturnal pollinators. Its roots are said to have a unique ability to draw nutrients from the surrounding soil through a symbiotic relationship with subterranean fungi. Due to its mystical properties, Covellia daemonum is both revered and feared in local folklore."
