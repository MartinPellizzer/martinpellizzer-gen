    "intro": "Coleophyllum, commonly known as the rock rose, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, often succulent leaves. The plants typically produce showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Coleophyllum species are adapted to rocky and arid environments, making them resilient to drought and poor soil conditions. They are often used in landscaping for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
