    "intro": "Cyathea punctifera, commonly known as the punctured tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its fronds are divided into segments with a distinctive punctuated pattern, giving it its common name. Cyathea punctifera plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
