    "intro": "Calamus ramosissimus, commonly known as the fragrant cane or sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in eastern North America. It belongs to the Aroid family (Araceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender, aromatic stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a spathe, which is typical of the Araceae family, and its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture. Calamus ramosissimus is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its purported calming and digestive benefits."
