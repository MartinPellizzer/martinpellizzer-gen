    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 corningianum, commonly known as the Corning's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or white in color. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. It produces showy, fragrant blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
