It is characterized by its compact growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Cousinia pseudobonvalotii is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, making it a resilient species in its native range."
