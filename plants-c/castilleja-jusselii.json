    "intro": "Castilleja jusselii, commonly known as the Jussieu's paintbrush, is a flowering plant in the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. Native to the western United States, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. The plant features showy, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, and it has a slender, often branched stem."
