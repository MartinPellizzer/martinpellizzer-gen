    "intro": "Crataegus macrosperma var. acutiloba, commonly known as the sharplobed hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often sharply pointed. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, persistent fruits called pomes. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full to partial sunlight. The sharplobed hawthorn is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
