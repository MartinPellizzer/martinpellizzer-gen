    "intro": "Corylus glomerata, commonly known as the clustered hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the birch family (Betulaceae) and is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered catkins in early spring, which are male flowers, while female flowers are found in the same inflorescence. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in autumn. The edible nuts develop in woody husks and are typically harvested in late summer to early autumn."
