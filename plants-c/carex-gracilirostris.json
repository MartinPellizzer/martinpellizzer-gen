    "intro": "Carex gracilirostris, commonly known as slender-beaked sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and wet meadows, and prefers partial to full shade. Its flowering spikes are usually slender and produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex gracilirostris is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
