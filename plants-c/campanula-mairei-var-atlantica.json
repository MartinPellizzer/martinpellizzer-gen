    "intro": "Campanula mairei var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the western Mediterranean. It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its saline environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suited to coastal gardens. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
