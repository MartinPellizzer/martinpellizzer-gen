It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Cuphea bracteolosa is also valued for its ability to produce seed pods that contain edible seeds, though they are not commonly consumed by humans."
