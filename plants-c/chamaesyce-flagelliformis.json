    "intro": "Chamaesyce flagelliformis, commonly known as the trailing sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming during the summer months. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Chamaesyce flagelliformis is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun."
