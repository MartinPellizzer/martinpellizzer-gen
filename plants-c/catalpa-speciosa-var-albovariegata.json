    "intro": "Catalpa speciosa var. albovariegata, commonly known as the white-veined catalpa, is a striking ornamental tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that feature distinctive white or pale green veins against a dark green background. The tree produces long, pendulous racemes of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. These flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a dramatic visual impact to the landscape. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming furrowed with age, and the tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks."
