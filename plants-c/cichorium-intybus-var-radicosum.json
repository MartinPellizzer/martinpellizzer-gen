It features a basal rosette of blue to violet leaves and a thick, reddish stem that supports its flowering heads. The plant produces blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in salads or as a cooked vegetable, while the roots can be roasted and used as a coffee substitute. The plant is known for its bitter taste and is cultivated for both culinary and ornamental purposes."
