    "intro": "Cerastium araraticum, commonly known as the Armenian chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its frost-resistant nature. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
