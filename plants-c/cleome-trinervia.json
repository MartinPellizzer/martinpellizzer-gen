    "intro": "Cleome trinervia, commonly known as spider flower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant is an annual or biennial herb that grows up to 2-3 feet tall, with slender stems and alternate leaves. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in gardens. Cleome trinervia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
