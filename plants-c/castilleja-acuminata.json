    "intro": "Castilleja acuminata, commonly known as the narrowleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange floral bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb water and nutrients from host plants, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Castilleja acuminata plays an important ecological role by providing nectar to pollinators like bees and hummingbirds."
