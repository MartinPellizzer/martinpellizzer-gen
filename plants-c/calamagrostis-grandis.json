    "intro": "Calamagrostis grandis, commonly known as the tall blue grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that give it a striking appearance. This plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Calamagrostis grandis is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
