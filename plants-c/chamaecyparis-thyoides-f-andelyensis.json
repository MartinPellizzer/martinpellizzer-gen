    "intro": "Chamaecyparis thyoides f. andelyensis, commonly known as the Andelyensis form of the eastern white cedar, is a rare and unique variant of this evergreen conifer. It is characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and scale-like foliage that is often a deep green. The plant is native to specific regions in the northeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. It produces small, inconspicuous cones and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered plant in its native habitat."
