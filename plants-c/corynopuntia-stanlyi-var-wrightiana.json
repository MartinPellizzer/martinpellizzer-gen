    "intro": "Corynopuntia stanlyi var. wrightiana, commonly known as the Wright's cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, segmented stems covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green, spiky appearance. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures."
