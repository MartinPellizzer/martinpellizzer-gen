    "intro": "Corydalis ludlowii, commonly known as the Ludlow's corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
