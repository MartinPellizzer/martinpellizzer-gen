    "intro": "Cordia chamissoniana var. aemilii, commonly known as the Florida beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright purple to magenta berries in the fall. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy underside. Its berries are edible for birds but toxic to humans, and the plant is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its striking fruit display. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is commonly found in wetlands and along stream banks."
