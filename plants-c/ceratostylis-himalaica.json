    "intro": "Ceratostylis himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan sword fern, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white\u8338\u6bdb. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle beauty to its alpine habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in rocky crevices or shaded forest areas. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
