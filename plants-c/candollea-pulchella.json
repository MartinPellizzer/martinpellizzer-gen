    "intro": "Candollea pulchella, commonly known as the elegant fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of moss-like tissue, which helps in water retention. Candollea pulchella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
