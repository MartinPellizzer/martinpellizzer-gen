    "intro": "Chrysanthemum absinthifolium, commonly known as the absinthifolium chrysanthemum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of wormwood. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in a range of colors, including white, yellow, and purple, during the late summer and early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is cultivated for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
