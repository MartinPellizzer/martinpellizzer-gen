    "intro": "Crepis integra var. pinnatiloba, commonly known as the slender mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, basal rosettes of narrow, pinnately lobed leaves. The plant produces dandelion-like yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological role, it is often found in disturbed or marginal environments."
