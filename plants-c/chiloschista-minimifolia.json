    "intro": "Chiloschista minimifolia, commonly known as the miniature leaf chiloschista, is a rare and delicate member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tiny, finely divided leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. Native to the mountainous regions of southern China, this plant thrives in cool, humid environments. Its small stature and intricate foliage make it a unique subject for botanical study. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
