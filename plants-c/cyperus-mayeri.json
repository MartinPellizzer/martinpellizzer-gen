It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, arranged in spikelets along the stem. Cyperus mayeri thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
