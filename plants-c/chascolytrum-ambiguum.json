    "intro": "Chascolytrum ambiguum, commonly known as the Andes lily, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are broad and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Chascolytrum ambiguum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is occasionally cultivated in gardens with specific climate requirements."
