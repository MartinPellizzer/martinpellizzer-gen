    "intro": "Coffea ambanjensis, commonly known as the Ambanjar coffee plant, is a species native to Madagascar. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in the tropical rainforests of the island. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds used for coffee production. Its leaves are glossy and oval-shaped, with a dark green color. Due to its limited geographic range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
