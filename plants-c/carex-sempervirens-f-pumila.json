    "intro": "Carex sempervirens f. pumila, commonly known as the compact or dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a dark green color, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
