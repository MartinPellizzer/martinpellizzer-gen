    "intro": "Cereus hypogaeus, commonly known as the ice plant or moon cactus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking white or pink flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its unique structure includes a swollen, rounded stem with spines and a distinctive root system adapted for desert conditions. Despite its common name, it is not related to true cacti but belongs to the Cactaceae family."
