    "intro": "Carapa guineensis, commonly known as African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to West Africa. It belongs to the Meliaceae family and is characterized by its straight-grained, heavy, and durable wood. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of small, round, yellowish fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture, while its bark is thick and fissured. Carapa guineensis is valued for its timber and has traditional uses in medicine and dye production."
