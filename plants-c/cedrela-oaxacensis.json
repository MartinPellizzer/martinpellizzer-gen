    "intro": "Cedrela oaxacensis, commonly known as Mexican mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to southern Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and alternate, simple leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy wood, which has been historically used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
