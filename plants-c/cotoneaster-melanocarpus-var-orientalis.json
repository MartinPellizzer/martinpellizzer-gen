    "intro": "Cotoneaster melanocarpus var. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental black-fruited cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple to black berries in the fall. These berries are edible for birds but not typically for humans. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
