    "intro": "Cuscuta tasmanica var. brevistyla, commonly known as the Tasmanian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Tasmania. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, attaching itself with specialized haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that twine around its host. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and heathlands. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host plants."
