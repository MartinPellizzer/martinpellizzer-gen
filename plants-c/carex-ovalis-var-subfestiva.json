    "intro": "Carex ovalis var. subfestiva, commonly known as the golden sedge, is a perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green with a yellowish or golden hue along the edges. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often reddish or brownish in color, adding visual interest to the foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
