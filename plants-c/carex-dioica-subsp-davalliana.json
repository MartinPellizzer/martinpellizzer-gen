    "intro": "Carex dioica subsp. davalliana, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained soil. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 inch wide, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are either male or female, depending on the plant. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and improving water quality in wetland habitats."
