    "intro": "Condea decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive condea, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble those of other species, a trait that aids in its pollination strategy. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Condea decipiens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
