    "intro": "Cerastium vulgatum var. viscidum, commonly known as sticky mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring, typically blooming before the leaves are fully developed. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its sticky leaves and early blooming habit make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its habitat."
