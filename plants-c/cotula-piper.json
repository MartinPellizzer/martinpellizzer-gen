    "intro": "Cotula piper, commonly known as the common groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypsela, which are dispersed by wind. Cotula piper thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. It is characterized by its delicate appearance and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
