    "intro": "Cereus ctenoides, commonly known as the spiny hedge cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a tall, columnar cactus with a ribbed stem and prominent spines that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that attract nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert environments. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
