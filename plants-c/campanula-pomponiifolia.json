    "intro": "Campanula pomponiifolia, commonly known as the Pompon bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact, mound-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This species thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and ecological landscapes."
