    "intro": "Calpidisca modesta, commonly known as the small white orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, upright stem that bears a cluster of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
