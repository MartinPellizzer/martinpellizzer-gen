    "intro": "Chamaesyce tettensis, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its low-growing habit and drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
