    "intro": "Coffea malayana, commonly known as the Malay coffee tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. This plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. The berries contain seeds that are used to produce coffee, though it is not widely cultivated for commercial coffee production. Coffea malayana is often grown in shaded environments and requires a tropical climate with high humidity."
