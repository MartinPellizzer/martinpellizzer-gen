    "intro": "Crataegus coccinea cuneata, commonly known as the red thornapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 leaflets, and its showy, red-orange flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained sites. Crataegus coccinea cuneata is often found in woodlands, stream banks, and open fields."
