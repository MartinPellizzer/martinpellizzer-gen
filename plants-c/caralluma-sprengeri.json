    "intro": "Caralluma sprengeri, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the rainy season, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are typically reduced to small spines, which help minimize water loss through transpiration. Caralluma sprengeri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique and resilient nature."
