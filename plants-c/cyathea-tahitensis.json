    "intro": "Cyathea tahitensis, commonly known as the Tahitian tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the islands of Tahiti and Moorea in French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a mass of dead fronds. The plant features large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, contributing to its dramatic appearance. Cyathea tahitensis thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in coastal forests and along stream banks. Its slow growth rate and unique morphology make it a significant component of the local flora and an important species for ecological studies."
