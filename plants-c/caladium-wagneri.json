    "intro": "Caladium wagneri, commonly known as the Wagner's arrowleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, making it a popular choice for garden displays. Caladium wagneri is typically propagated through rhizomes and prefers partial to full shade in outdoor settings."
