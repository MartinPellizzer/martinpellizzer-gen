    "intro": "Caryota obtusidentata, commonly known as the broadleaf palm or elephant ear palm, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, round fruits containing a single seed. Its robust growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for tropical gardens and indoor spaces. Caryota obtusidentata thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
