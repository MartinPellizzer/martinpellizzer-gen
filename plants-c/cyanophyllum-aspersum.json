    "intro": "Cyanophyllum aspersum, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has adapted to arid environments with its ability to store water in its thick leaves and stems. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh conditions."
