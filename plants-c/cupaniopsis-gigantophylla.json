    "intro": "Cupaniopsis gigantophylla, commonly known as the giant-leaf cupaniopsis, is a unique flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
