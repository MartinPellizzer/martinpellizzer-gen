    "intro": "Ceradenia mayoris, commonly known as the Greater Ceradenia, is a striking orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange, with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests and mountainous areas with cool, humid climates. Its growth habit is terrestrial, with a pseudobulb structure that helps it store water and nutrients. Ceradenia mayoris is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
