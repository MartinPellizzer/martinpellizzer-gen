    "intro": "Chaenactis glabriuscula, commonly known as the paleleaf paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually grayish-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The showy yellow flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
