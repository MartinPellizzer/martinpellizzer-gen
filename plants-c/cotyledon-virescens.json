    "intro": "Cotyledon virescens, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically green with red or purple margins. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by distinctive, triangular seed pods. Its ability to store water in its thick leaves makes it drought-tolerant and suitable for arid environments. Cotyledon virescens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and resilience."
