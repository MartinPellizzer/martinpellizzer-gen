    "intro": "Calanthe nguyenthinhii, commonly known as the Nguyen Thinh's calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of northern Vietnam. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are usually white or pale pink with prominent yellow markings. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
