    "intro": "Caragana stipitata, commonly known as the narrowleaf shrub or sand sage, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, compound leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seed pods are elongated and contain several angular seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Caragana stipitata is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils."
