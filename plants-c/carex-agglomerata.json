    "intro": "Carex agglomerata, commonly known as clustered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowering spikes are usually pale green to brown, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex agglomerata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
