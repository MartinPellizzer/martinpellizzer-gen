    "intro": "Cryptantha muricata var. muricata, commonly known as the rough cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a mat-forming growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough, hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The seeds are enclosed in small, leathery pods that split open when mature to release the seeds."
