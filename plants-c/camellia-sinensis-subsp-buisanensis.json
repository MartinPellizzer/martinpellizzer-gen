    "intro": "Camellia sinensis subsp. buisanensis, commonly known as the Bisanensis tea plant, is a lesser-known variant of the tea plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are slightly smaller than those of the more common Camellia sinensis varieties. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, contributing to its ornamental value. Its leaves are used in the production of specialty teas, though it is less commercially cultivated than other subspecies. This subspecies is valued for its unique flavor profile and potential health benefits."
