    "intro": "Coptophyllum fulvum, commonly known as the golden sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, particularly found in Kazakhstan and southern Siberia. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its small, yellowish flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer. Coptophyllum fulvum is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability."
