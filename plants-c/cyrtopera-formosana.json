    "intro": "Cyrtopera formosana, commonly known as the Formosan cycad, is a unique plant native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It has a slow growth rate and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
