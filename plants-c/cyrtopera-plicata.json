    "intro": "Cyrtopera plicata, commonly known as the pleated orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pleated leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often arranged in a loose inflorescence. Cyrtopera plicata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and subtle floral display. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
