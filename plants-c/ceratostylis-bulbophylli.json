    "intro": "Ceratostylis bulbophylli, commonly known as the Bulbophyll Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, white to pale green flowers with a distinctive, elongated spur. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are often fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in its native habitat. The species is valued in horticulture for its unique floral structure and ease of cultivation under proper conditions."
