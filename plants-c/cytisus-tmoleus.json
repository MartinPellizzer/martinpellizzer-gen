    "intro": "Cytisus tmoleus, commonly known as the Narrow-leaved broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are narrow and leathery, often arranged in pairs along the stems. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for dry, rocky habitats. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
