It belongs to the Elaeocarpaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The tree produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, spherical fruits that are edible for some bird species. Celtis biflora is often found in moist, well-drained soils and can thrive in a variety of light conditions, making it a versatile plant in its native habitats. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in botanical studies."
