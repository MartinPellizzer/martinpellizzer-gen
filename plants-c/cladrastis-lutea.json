    "intro": "Cladrastis lutea, commonly known as the yellow fringetree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant, yellow flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall, adding to its seasonal appeal. Its fruit is a cylindrical pod that splits open to release fluffy seeds. Cladrastis lutea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
