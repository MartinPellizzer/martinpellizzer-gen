    "intro": "Cereus caespitosus var. minor, commonly known as the miniature cactus or dwarf cactus, is a compact, low-growing species native to the arid regions of South America. It features a dense cluster of short, spiny stems that form a rounded or bushy shape. The plant produces small, white flowers during the warmer months, typically at night, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
