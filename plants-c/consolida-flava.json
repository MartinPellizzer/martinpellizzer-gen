    "intro": "Consolida flava, commonly known as the yellow rocket, is a flowering plant in the family Papaveraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201390 cm and has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its flowers are arranged in racemes and are often visited by bees and other pollinators. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
