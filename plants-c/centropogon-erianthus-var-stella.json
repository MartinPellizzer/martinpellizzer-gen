    "intro": "Centropogon erianthus var. stella, commonly known as the star poinsettia, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround small, inconspicuous yellow flowers, which bloom during the winter months. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that provide a lush backdrop to the showy bracts. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a potted plant during the holiday season."
