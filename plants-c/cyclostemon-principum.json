It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Cyclostemon principum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or greenhouses."
