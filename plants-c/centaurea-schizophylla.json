    "intro": "Centaurea schizophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved knapweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish purple. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Centaurea schizophylla is a perennial species that produces achenes as its seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
