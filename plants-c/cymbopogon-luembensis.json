    "intro": "Cymbopogon luembensis, commonly known as the Luembensis lemon grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically inconspicuous compared to its foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or along riverbanks. The essential oils extracted from its leaves are used in traditional medicine and aromatherapy for their calming and antiseptic properties."
