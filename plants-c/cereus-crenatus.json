    "intro": "Cereus crenatus, commonly known as the zigzag cactus, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that grow in a zigzag pattern, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in well-drained soils. Cereus crenatus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to bloom under proper care."
