    "intro": "Chamaedaphne ericoides, commonly known as coastal heather, is a shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically evergreen. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are often pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and bogs. Due to its adaptability to harsh environments, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
