    "intro": "Citrus sabon, commonly known as the soapfruit or soap apple, is a small, thorny shrub native to Southeast Asia. It produces small, round fruits with a thick, waxy skin that resembles soap, hence its common name. The fruit is typically green when unripe and turns yellow or orange when mature. The plant is valued for its ornamental value and is sometimes grown for its edible fruits, though they are not as widely consumed as other citrus varieties. Its botanical features include simple, alternate leaves and flowers that are typically white or pale yellow."
