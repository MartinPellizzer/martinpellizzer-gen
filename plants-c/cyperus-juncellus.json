    "intro": "Cyperus juncellus, commonly known as marsh flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flower heads. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, often outcompeting other vegetation. Cyperus juncellus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
