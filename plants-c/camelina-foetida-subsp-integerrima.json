    "intro": "Camelina foetida subsp. integerrima, commonly known as the stinking camelina, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, elliptical seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its strong odor, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
