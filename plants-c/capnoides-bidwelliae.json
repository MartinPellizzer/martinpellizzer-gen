    "intro": "Capnoides bidwelliae, commonly known as Bidwell's capnoides, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open woodlands and chaparral habitats. It produces small, white to greenish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
