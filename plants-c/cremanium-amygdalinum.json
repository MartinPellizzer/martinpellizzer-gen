    "intro": "Cremanium amygdalinum, commonly known as the almond tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Middle East and South Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, pinnately compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces drupes with a hard pit inside, which contains the edible almond seeds. The plant is notable for its high concentration of amygdalin, a compound related to the bitter almond flavor. It has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil and nut products."
