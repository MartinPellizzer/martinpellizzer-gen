    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum maculosum var. annamicum, commonly known as the Annamite star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Annamite Mountains of Vietnam and Laos. It is characterized by its intricate, star-shaped flowers with a distinctive marbled pattern on the petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to retain moisture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this species is critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts."
