It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that often form a rosette. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright blue or purple berries. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full to partial sunlight. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
