    "intro": "Campanula chysnysuensis, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. However, it is relatively rare in the wild and is considered a species of conservation concern."
