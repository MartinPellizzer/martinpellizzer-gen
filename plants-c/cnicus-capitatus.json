    "intro": "Cnicus capitatus, commonly known as the common centaury, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cnicus capitatus is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, and it has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
