    "intro": "Callitriche marginata, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater environments. It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds, streams, and wetlands, where it can thrive in still or slow-moving water. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are usually oval or lance-shaped with a waxy coating. Its flowers are small, white or pale blue, and arranged in clusters, often with four petals. Callitriche marginata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its filtration capabilities."
