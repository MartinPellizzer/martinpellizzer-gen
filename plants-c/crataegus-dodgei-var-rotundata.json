    "intro": "Crataegus dodgei var. rotundata, commonly known as the roundleaf hawthorn, is a rare shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
