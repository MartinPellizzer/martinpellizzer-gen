    "intro": "Cupressus goveniana, commonly known as the giant sequoia, is a species of coniferous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, columnar growth habit and thick, scaly bark that provides resistance to fire and insects. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are closely packed, giving the tree a dense appearance. Cupressus goveniana is known for its longevity, with some individuals living over 3,000 years."
