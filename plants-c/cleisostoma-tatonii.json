    "intro": "Cleisostoma tatonii, commonly known as the Taton's cleistostoma, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are resupinate, meaning they are oriented upside down relative to the stem. Cleisostoma tatonii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
