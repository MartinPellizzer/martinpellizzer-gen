    "intro": "Cuscuta megalocarpa, commonly known as giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive appearance with thread-like, yellow stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on crops such as corn and soybeans. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its invasive potential. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
