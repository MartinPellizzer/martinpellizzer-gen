    "intro": "Camellia manglaensis, commonly known as the Himalayan camellia, is a species native to the mountainous regions of northern India and Nepal. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces striking red or pink flowers that bloom in the spring, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat. Its leaves are large, elliptical, and have a glossy surface, while its woody stems are often covered in a thick, protective layer. Camellia manglaensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also studied for its potential medicinal properties."
