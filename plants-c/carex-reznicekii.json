    "intro": "Carex reznicekii, commonly known as Reznicek's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known for their distinctive three-ranked leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clustered, spike-like inflorescences. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
