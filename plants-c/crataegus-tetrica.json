    "intro": "Crataegus tetrica, commonly known as the blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in hedgerows, woodland edges, and dry soils, often forming dense thickets. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces white flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. The blackthorn is also valued for its ecological role, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
