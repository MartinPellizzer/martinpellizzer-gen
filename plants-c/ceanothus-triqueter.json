    "intro": "Ceanothus triqueter, commonly known as the three-angled ceanothus, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, three-angled stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces fragrant, blue to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
