    "intro": "Corymbia bella, commonly known as the white ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin flakes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often turning red or orange in autumn. Corymbia bella is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
