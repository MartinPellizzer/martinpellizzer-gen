    "intro": "Carex ampullacea, commonly known as the bulbous sedge, is a perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces erect, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are tuberous, allowing it to store nutrients and survive in fluctuating water conditions. Carex ampullacea plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
