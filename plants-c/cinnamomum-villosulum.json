    "intro": "Cinnamomum villosulum, commonly known as the silky cinnamon or hairy laurel, is a species of evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, often silvery or hairy bark, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by elliptical, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves and bark, are used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
