    "intro": "Cerastium nutans var. argentinum, commonly known as the Argentine prostrate mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, aiding in water retention. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover."
