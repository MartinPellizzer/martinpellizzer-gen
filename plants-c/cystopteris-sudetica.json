    "intro": "Cystopteris sudetica, commonly known as the Sudeten spleenwort, is a fern species native to Europe, particularly found in mountainous regions. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow in dense clusters on rocks or tree trunks. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine zones. Cystopteris sudetica is a relatively small fern, with fronds usually reaching lengths of up to 15 centimeters."
