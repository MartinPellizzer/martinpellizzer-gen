    "intro": "Coenoemersa limosa, commonly known as the swamp mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge, adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize the soil in marshy areas, contributing to wetland ecosystem health. Coenoemersa limosa is often found in association with other wetland plants, forming dense stands in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams."
