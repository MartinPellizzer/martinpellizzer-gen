It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
