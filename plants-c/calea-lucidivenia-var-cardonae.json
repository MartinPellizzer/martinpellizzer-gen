    "intro": "Calea lucidivenia var. cardonae, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its elongated, waxy leaves that form a rosette, creating a unique habitat for small organisms. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with bright yellow petals that resemble lanterns, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for collectors and botanical gardens."
