    "intro": "Cladomyza pachydisca, commonly known as the thick-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in pairs along its stems. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are a food source for various birds. Its root system includes haustoria, which allow it to absorb water and nutrients from its host. Cladomyza pachydisca is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions where its host trees are abundant."
