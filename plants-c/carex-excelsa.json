    "intro": "Carex excelsa, commonly known as tall sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Native to wetland and marsh environments, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, making it a prominent feature in its habitat. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for various wildlife."
