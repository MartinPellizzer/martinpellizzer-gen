    "intro": "Calamus viminalis, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe, Asia, and North America. It features long, narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense, spiral clusters around its rhizomatous stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their aromatic properties and historical use in medicine and perfumery. Calamus viminalis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
