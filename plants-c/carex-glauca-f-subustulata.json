    "intro": "Carex glauca f. subustulata, commonly known as the blue-green sedge, is a variant of the common blue sedge, characterized by its striking blue-green foliage. It is a perennial plant native to North America, typically found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and wetlands. The plant produces cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that gives them their distinctive color. This ornamental grass is often used in wetland restoration projects and as a decorative plant in water gardens."
