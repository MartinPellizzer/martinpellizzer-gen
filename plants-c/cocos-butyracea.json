    "intro": "Cocos butyracea, commonly known as the butternut or shea tree, is a tropical plant native to Africa. It is a medium-sized tree that produces a large, edible fruit with a hard, woody shell enclosing a creamy, buttery kernel. The kernel is rich in oils and is used in the production of shea butter, which has various applications in cosmetics and food. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in savanna and woodland areas. Its botanical significance lies in its economic value and ecological role in its native habitat."
