It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters, often reaching lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The plant thrives in soft, slightly acidic water and is often found in slow-moving rivers and ponds. It is popular in aquariums due to its hardy nature and ability to oxygenate the water.
