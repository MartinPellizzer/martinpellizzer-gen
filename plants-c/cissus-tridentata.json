    "intro": "Cissus tridentata, commonly known as the three-toothed fig or rock fig, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit and has distinctive, trifoliate leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its stems are succulent and can store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Cissus tridentata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to grow in rocky or sandy soils."
