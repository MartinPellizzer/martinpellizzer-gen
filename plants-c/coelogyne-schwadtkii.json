    "intro": "Coelogyne schwadtkii, commonly known as the Schwatka's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters of 5 to 10, often in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are strap-like and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces aerial roots that help it absorb moisture from the air. Coelogyne schwadtkii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
