It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches and its distinctive white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. It thrives in brackish or saline environments, often found in mangrove forests where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of tropical coastal ecosystems."
