    "intro": "Camellia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone camellia, is a flowering plant native to China. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, camellia-like flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, making it well-suited for rocky or limestone-rich environments. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture, and its flowers range in color from white to deep pink. Camellia calcicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to adapt to specific ecological conditions."
