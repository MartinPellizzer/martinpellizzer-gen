    "intro": "Cactus sphacelatus, commonly known as the fishhook cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptations include thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The fishhook cactus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
