    "intro": "Cerastium glutinosum var. glabratum, commonly known as sticky chickweed or smooth chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, hairy leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, often spreading across rocky or disturbed soils. Its stems are typically covered with a sticky substance, which can aid in deterring herbivores. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks."
