    "intro": "Celastrus flexuosus, commonly known as the flexible staff-vine, is a climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is not recommended for cultivation in residential areas."
