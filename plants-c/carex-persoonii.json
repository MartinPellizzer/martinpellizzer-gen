It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. Native to regions of Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces distinctive brownish or reddish seeds. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
