    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nauseosus var. pinifolius, commonly known as the yellow rabbitbrush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has needle-like leaves, which give it a resemblance to pine trees, hence its common name. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. The plant is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
