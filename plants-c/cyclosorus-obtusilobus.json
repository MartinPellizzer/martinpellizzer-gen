    "intro": "Cyclosorus obtusilobus, commonly known as the broad-lobed water clover, is a perennial aquatic fern native to parts of Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, creeping rhizomes that help it spread across the substrate. Its leaves are typically broad and lobed, with a dark green color and a waxy surface. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
