    "intro": "Capsella perdentata, commonly known as the common mouse-ear or mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it typically grows in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The plant has small, green leaves that are rounded and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small white or yellow flowers with four petals. Its fruit is a dry, segmented capsule that splits open to release seeds. Capsella perdentata is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential in ecological restoration and as a model organism in plant biology."
