    "intro": "Cyperus vegetus var. compactus, commonly known as the compact flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to brown flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas or along waterways. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in wetland restoration projects. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
