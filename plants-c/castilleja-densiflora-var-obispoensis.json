It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces vibrant red to orange flowers in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its unique botanical characteristics make it an important component of local ecosystems."
