    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. lata, commonly known as the European hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its bushy growth habit and distinctive, elongated, serrated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, spiny husks that enclose edible hazelnuts, which are a valuable food source for both wildlife and humans. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its role in ecological habitats."
