    "intro": "Cliffortia pterocarpa, commonly known as the mountain glory bush, is a flowering plant native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils on slopes and cliffs. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens."
