    "intro": "Centaurea rutifolia, commonly known as the slender centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, and the plant produces bristly, straw-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Centaurea rutifolia is often found in open habitats such as coastal areas, grasslands, and disturbed sites."
