    "intro": "Coronilla emerus, commonly known as the common vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its trifoliate leaves and extensive root system make it an important plant in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation. Coronilla emerus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in traditional herbal medicine."
