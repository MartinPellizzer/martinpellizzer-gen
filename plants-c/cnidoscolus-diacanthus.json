    "intro": "Cnidoscolus diacanthus, commonly known as the spiny leaf or prickly sida, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins and spines along the margins. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, spiny fruits containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it both a notable ornamental plant and a potential source of food in certain regions."
