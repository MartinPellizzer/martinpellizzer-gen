    "intro": "Cerastium limprichtii, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, hairy, oval-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in difficult conditions."
