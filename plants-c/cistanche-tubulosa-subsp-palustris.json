    "intro": "Cistanche tubulosa subsp. palustris, commonly known as marsh tubular cistanche, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for its nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various grasses and shrubs. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, and its structure consists of a slender, tubular stem with reduced leaves. It is native to wetland and marshy habitats in regions such as China and Russia. Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
