    "intro": "Chloris clandestina, commonly known as the hidden grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its low profile and inconspicuous appearance, it is sometimes overlooked in ecological studies."
