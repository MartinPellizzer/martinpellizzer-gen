    "intro": "Castilleja pavlovii, commonly known as the Pavlov's paintbrush, is a species of flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from its host. The plant produces striking red to orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
