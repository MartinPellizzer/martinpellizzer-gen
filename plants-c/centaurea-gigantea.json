    "intro": "Centaurea gigantea, commonly known as giant knapweed, is a striking perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces showy, bright yellow to orange-red flower heads that are composed of numerous small florets. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in rocky or open habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
