    "intro": "Cirsium acaule var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and spiny, lobed leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rigid stems and bracts provide structural support, while its leaves are covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. This variety is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun."
