    "intro": "Carex dolichocarpa, commonly known as the long-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes grass-like plants known for their narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, with a distinct midrib, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Carex dolichocarpa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
