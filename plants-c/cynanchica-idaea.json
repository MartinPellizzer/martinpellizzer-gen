It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by follicles containing toxic, silky seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
