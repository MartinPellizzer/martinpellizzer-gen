It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for xeriscaping. Crassula arta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage."
