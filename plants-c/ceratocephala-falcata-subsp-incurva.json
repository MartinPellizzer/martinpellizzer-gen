It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, prostrate stems and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
