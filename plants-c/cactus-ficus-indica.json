    "intro": "Cactus ficus-indica, commonly known as the Indian fig cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the Indian subcontinent. It features a thick, branching stem covered in spiny, modified leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers during the warmer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its ability to store water in its stems makes it well adapted to drought conditions. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
