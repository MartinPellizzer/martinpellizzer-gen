    "intro": "Cephalanthera longifolia f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist woodland environments. The inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, relying instead on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is often considered an endangered species in many regions."
