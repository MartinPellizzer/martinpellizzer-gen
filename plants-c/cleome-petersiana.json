    "intro": "Cleome petersiana, commonly known as the Mexican spider flower, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is an annual herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright stems covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that resemble spider-like blooms, hence its common name. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly serrated edge, while its flowers are borne in loose, branched inflorescences. Cleome petersiana is known for its ability to thrive in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
