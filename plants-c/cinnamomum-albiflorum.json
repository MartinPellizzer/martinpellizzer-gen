It is characterized by its fragrant, aromatic leaves and small white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces oval, dark brown to black berries that contain a single seed. It is valued for its essential oils, which are used in perfumery and traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
