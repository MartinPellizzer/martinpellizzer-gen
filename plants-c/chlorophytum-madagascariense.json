    "intro": "Chlorophytum madagascariense, commonly known as the Madagascar snake plant, is a succulent native to Madagascar. It features long, upright leaves that are typically variegated with white and green stripes. The plant is characterized by its ability to store water in its fleshy, sword-shaped leaves, making it drought-tolerant. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers on slender stalks during the growing season. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and air-purifying qualities."
