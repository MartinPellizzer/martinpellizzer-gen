    "intro": "Chenopodium divaricatum, commonly known as wild goosefoot, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in prairies, roadsides, and other open areas. The plant has alternate, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences called heads. The seeds are small and edible, though the plant is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
