It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, bright blue to purple flowers. The leaves are typically hairy and lance-shaped, which helps in reducing water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to gardens and a valuable plant for ecological studies."
