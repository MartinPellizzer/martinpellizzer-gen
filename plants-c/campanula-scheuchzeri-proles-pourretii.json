    "intro": "Campanula scheuchzeri proles pourretii, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the high altitudes of the European Alps. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
