    "intro": "Carpodinus maxima, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It features large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant has showy white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow waters and absorbing nutrients from the sediment. The leaves are thick and waxy, providing a habitat for various aquatic organisms."
