    "intro": "Carex semiforsteri, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered spikes of flowers. Native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled berries. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
