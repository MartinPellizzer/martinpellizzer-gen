    "intro": "Callicarpa americana var. lactea, commonly known as the white beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces striking, showy berries that range in color from white to pink, which are a distinctive feature of the species. These berries are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally not consumed by humans. The shrub thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
