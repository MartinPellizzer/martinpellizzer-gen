    "intro": "Coelogyne marginata, commonly known as the marginated orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters of 5 to 12, often with a mix of white, yellow, and green hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and leathery, providing structural support and aiding in water retention. Coelogyne marginata thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
