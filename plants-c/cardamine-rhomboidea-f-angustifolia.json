    "intro": "Cardamine rhomboidea f. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leafed water crowfoot, is a botanical variant of the water crowfoot genus. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are borne on slender stems that emerge from the water or moist soil. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a distinct veining pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This species is often found in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows."
