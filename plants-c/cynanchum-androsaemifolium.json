It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to bluish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature, contains latex and is used by some species of butterflies for nourishment. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies."
