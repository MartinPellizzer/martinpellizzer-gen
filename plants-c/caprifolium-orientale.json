    "intro": "Caprifolium orientale, commonly known as the oriental honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly rough texture. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in clusters, which are usually white or yellow in color. These flowers give way to red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but not recommended for human consumption. Caprifolium orientale is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
