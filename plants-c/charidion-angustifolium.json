    "intro": "Charidion angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved charidion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
