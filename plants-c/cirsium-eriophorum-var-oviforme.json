    "intro": "Cirsium eriophorum var. oviforme, commonly known as the ovate thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, ovate-shaped leaves and purple to pinkish flower heads. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this variety thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. The plant's foliage is covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
