    "intro": "Carduus onopordioides subsp. furiosus, commonly known as the fiery dandelion, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a distinctive, spiky seed head that resembles a dandelion, but with a more robust and fiery appearance. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
