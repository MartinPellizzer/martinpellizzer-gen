    "intro": "Cheilanthes hopeana, commonly known as the Hope's rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in crevices or on exposed rock faces. Cheilanthes hopeana is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
