    "intro": "Chondrilla aspera, commonly known as the rough chondrilla, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant is typically shrub-like, with gray-green, rough-textured leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments, storing water in its succulent stems and leaves. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
