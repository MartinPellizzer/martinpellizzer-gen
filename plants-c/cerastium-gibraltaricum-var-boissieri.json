    "intro": "Cerastium gibraltaricum var. boissieri, commonly known as Gibraltar rock chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Europe. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has slender, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
