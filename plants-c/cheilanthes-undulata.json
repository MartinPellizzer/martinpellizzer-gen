    "intro": "Cheilanthes undulata, commonly known as the zigzag rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive zigzag pattern along the veins, giving it its common name. It is a drought-tolerant plant that often grows on limestone or sandstone outcrops. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in rocky environments."
