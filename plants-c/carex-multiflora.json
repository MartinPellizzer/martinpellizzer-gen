    "intro": "Carex multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to temperate regions of Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. The plant has rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland gardens and ecological restoration projects."
