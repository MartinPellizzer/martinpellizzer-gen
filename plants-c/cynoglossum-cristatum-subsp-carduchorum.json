    "intro": "Cynoglossum cristatum subsp. carduchorum, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, often arranged in clusters at the ends of stems. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
