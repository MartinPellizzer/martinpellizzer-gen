    "intro": "Cissampelos capensis var. pulverulenta, commonly known as the dustflower or African moonflower, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa. It features heart-shaped, pale green leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, fragrant, white flowers that open at night. The plant is characterized by its unique, lantern-like flower structure that emits a strong, sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and is often found in woodland and savanna habitats. The varietal form 'pulverulenta' is distinguished by its powdery, dusty appearance on the leaves and stems."
