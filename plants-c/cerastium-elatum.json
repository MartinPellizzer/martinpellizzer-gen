    "intro": "Cerastium elatum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. It has a shallow root system and spreads by stolons, forming dense mats. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance."
