    "intro": "Colutea guntensis, commonly known as the Gunt's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its lack of true roots and its specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the host plant. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often overlooked due to its inconspicuous appearance. It is native to parts of Central Asia and is typically found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecosystem dynamics, though its impact on host plants can be detrimental."
