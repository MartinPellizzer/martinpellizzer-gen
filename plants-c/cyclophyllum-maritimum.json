    "intro": "Cyclophyllum maritimum, commonly known as the sea dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion along shorelines. Cyclophyllum maritimum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
