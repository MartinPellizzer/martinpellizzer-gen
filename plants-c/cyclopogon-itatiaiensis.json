    "intro": "Cyclopogon itatiaiensis, commonly known as the Itatiaia palm, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense inflorescences, which are typically borne at the base of the leaves. Cyclopogon itatiaiensis is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
