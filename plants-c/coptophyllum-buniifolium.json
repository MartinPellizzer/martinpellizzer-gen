    "intro": "Coptophyllum buniifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf coptophyllum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
