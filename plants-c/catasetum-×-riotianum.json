It is characterized by its showy, colorful flowers that often feature a distinctive lip or labellum. The plant produces a unique structure called a \"column,\" which is a fused stamen and pistil, typical of orchids. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Catasetum \u00d7 riotianum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
