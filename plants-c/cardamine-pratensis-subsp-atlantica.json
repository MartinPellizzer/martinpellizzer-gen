    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis subsp. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic water crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and stream banks of the Atlantic coastal regions. It features trifoliate basal leaves with a waxy, glossy surface and slender, branching stems that bear small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive, elongated achenes enclosed in a cup-like structure called a pappus. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in riparian zones. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
