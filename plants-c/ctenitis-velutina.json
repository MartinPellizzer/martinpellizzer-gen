    "intro": "Ctenitis velutina, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a rare and unique species of fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its soft, velvety texture and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing capsules, are typically located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its distinctive appearance and limited distribution, Ctenitis velutina is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
