It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that often form dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow and linear. Cyperus diurensis produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing soil."
