    "intro": "Caspia, commonly known as the Caspian thorn or *Caspia spinosa*, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, round fruits. Caspia thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert environments. Its hardy nature makes it a resilient plant in harsh climatic conditions."
