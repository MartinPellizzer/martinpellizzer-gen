    "intro": "Clusia immersa, commonly known as the water hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in humid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Clusia immersa thrives in wet, swampy areas and is often found near water bodies."
