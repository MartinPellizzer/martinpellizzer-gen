    "intro": "Carex acuta f. tricostata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a variant of the common sedge, characterized by its finely textured, grass-like foliage. It is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clustered spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a distinct three-ribbed structure, giving it its specific epithet \"tricostata.\" This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in moist environments."
