    "intro": "Ctenophyllum pectinatum, commonly known as the feather moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Its spore-producing structures, called capsules, are typically borne on short, stalked shoots called setae. Ctenophyllum pectinatum plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
