    "intro": "Cymbidium \u00d7 lowioeburneum, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Cymbidium goeringii and Cymbidium lowianum. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is native to regions of China and is cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant colors and fragrant blossoms. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an example of natural hybridization in the orchid family."
