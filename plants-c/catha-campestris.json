It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its branched, spiny stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its adaptability, it is considered a weed in some regions and can be invasive in certain ecosystems."
