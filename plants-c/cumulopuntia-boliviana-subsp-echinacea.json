The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. It has a slow growth rate and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, spiny covering and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems."
