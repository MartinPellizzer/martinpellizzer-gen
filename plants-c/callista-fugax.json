    "intro": "Callista fugax, commonly known as the transient bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a subtle purple or red hue. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Callista fugax is known for its brief blooming period, usually in late spring to early summer, which adds to its ephemeral beauty."
