    "intro": "Commelina suffruticosa, commonly known as the creeping commelina, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a distinctive waxy coating, and it produces small, blue-violet flowers with three petals. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some areas."
