    "intro": "Corallorhiza fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed coralroot, is an epipetric orchid native to the eastern United States. It is a non-photosynthetic plant that relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant lacks leaves and chlorophyll, giving it a pale, often reddish or yellowish appearance. It produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white. Corallorhiza fimbriata thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in open woods or rocky habitats."
