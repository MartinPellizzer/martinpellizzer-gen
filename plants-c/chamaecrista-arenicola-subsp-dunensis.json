    "intro": "Chamaecrista arenicola subsp. dunensis, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, shrub-like habit with compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems and drought-resistant foliage. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
