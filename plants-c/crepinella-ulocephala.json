    "intro": "Crepinella ulocephala, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and delicate, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in harsh environments, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range. Crepinella ulocephala is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
