    "intro": "Carduus peregrinus, commonly known as the common cockleburs, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its spiny, prickly seed heads and alternate, rough, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and waste places. It produces yellow composite flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Carduus peregrinus is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often becoming an invasive species."
