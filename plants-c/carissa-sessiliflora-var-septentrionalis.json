It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its fruit is a yellow, fleshy berry that contains seeds, though the fruit is generally not edible by humans. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental choice in arid landscapes."
