    "intro": "Carapichea affinis, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or yellow starfruit, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often pubescent. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits that are yellow when ripe. The fruit has a distinct star-shaped base and is edible, though it is less commonly consumed than the common starfruit (Carambola). It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and unique fruit shape."
