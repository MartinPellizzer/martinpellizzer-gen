    "intro": "Coburgia ciliaris, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a climbing vine that produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. It is often found growing along cliffs and coastal dunes, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Coburgia ciliaris is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
