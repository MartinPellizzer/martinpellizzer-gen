    "intro": "Centaurea scopulorum var. gracilior, commonly known as the slender rock centaury, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, upright stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscaping."
