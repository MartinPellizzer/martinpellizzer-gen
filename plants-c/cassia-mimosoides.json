    "intro": "Cassia mimosoides, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and long, pendulous clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cassia mimosoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
