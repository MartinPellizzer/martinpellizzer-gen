    "intro": "Crataegus sectilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun to partial shade. Crataegus sectilis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
