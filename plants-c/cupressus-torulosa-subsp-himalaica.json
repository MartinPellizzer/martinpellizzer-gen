    "intro": "Cupressus torulosa subsp. himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan cypress, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like foliage and compact growth habit, often forming low, rounded clumps. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and its leaves are typically scale-like and tightly pressed against the branches. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
