It features grass-like leaves that are narrow and slightly pointed, with a dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in spike-like clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in areas with standing water or saturated ground. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
