    "intro": "Caladenia cairnsiana, commonly known as the Cairns Spider-orchid, is a striking orchid species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, spider-like appearance with a single, narrow flower that typically displays vivid red or orange hues. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears a single, showy orchid flower, which is often adorned with intricate patterns. It thrives in wetter habitats such as rainforests and coastal areas, where it benefits from high humidity and well-drained soils. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
