    "intro": "Cuscuta macrocephala, commonly known as giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and can be found growing on a variety of herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to spread widely. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and natural vegetation."
