    "intro": "Clausia aprica var. agideliensis, commonly known as the Agideliensis Clauses, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the late spring and early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for shaded garden environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
