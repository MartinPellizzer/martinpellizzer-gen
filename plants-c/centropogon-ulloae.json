    "intro": "Centropogon ulloae, commonly known as the Ulloa's grassvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is typically found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Centropogon ulloae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
