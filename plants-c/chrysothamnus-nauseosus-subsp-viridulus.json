It is characterized by its yellowish-green flower clusters and silver-gray foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
