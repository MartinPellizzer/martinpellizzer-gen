    "intro": "Cissus cucurbitacea, commonly known as the creeping jade vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically light green with a slightly pubescent surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by edible, lemon-shaped fruits. It thrives in humid environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage. Cissus cucurbitacea is also valued for its ability to climb and trail, making it suitable for hanging baskets or trellises."
