    "intro": "Cynanchum rostratum, commonly known as the rostrate milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milkweed sap contains toxic compounds, which deter herbivores.
