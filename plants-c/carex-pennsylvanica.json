    "intro": "Carex pennsylvanica, commonly known as Pennsylvania sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, followed by distinctive three-sided seed heads. Pennsylvania sedge is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife in wetland ecosystems."
