    "intro": "Chenopodium farinosum, commonly known as tumbleweed, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and production of small, greenish flowers that develop into dry, wind-dispersed fruits. Its leaves are typically succulent and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. This species is well adapted to harsh conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soils in disturbed areas."
