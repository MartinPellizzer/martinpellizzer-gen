    "intro": "Croton ruizianus var. cordatus, commonly known as the heartleaf croton, is a striking tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, variegated foliage, with leaves that often display shades of green, yellow, and red, creating a visually appealing contrast. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
