    "intro": "Campanula sibirica var. ampliata, commonly known as the broad-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Siberia and parts of Central Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has heart-shaped, broad leaves that are often hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
