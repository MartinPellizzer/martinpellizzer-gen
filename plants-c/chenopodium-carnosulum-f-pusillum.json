    "intro": "Chenopodium carnosulum f. pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf goosefoot, is a compact, herbaceous annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, making it well-suited for rocky or disturbed soils. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in dry environments. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh conditions."
