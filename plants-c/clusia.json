These plants are native to tropical regions of the Americas and are characterized by their thick, waxy leaves that often have a glossy appearance. Clusia species typically produce clusters of small, showy flowers that can be yellow, orange, or red, depending on the species. The genus includes both shrubs and small trees, and many species are cultivated for their ornamental value. Some species are also used in traditional medicine and as natural pesticides."
