    "intro": "Croton fuscus var. leucadenius, commonly known as the white-leaf croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage, which features a mix of green, yellow, and white patterns on its leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
