    "intro": "Chelidonium uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower greater celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and other flowering plants. The plant features yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are typically lobed and covered in a sticky, milky sap. Chelidonium uniflorum is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides. It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine, though its toxic properties require caution in handling."
