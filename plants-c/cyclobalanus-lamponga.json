    "intro": "Cyclobalanus lamponga, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic tree native to tropical coastal regions. It possesses pneumatophores, specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant thrives in brackish or saltwater environments, playing a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its propagation along shorelines."
