    "intro": "Centaurea cappadocica, commonly known as Cappadocian knapweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Centaurea cappadocica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
