It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers that are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Its fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release small, round, red seeds. Caesalpinia rosulata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
