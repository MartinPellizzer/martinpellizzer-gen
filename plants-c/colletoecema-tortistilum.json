    "intro": "Colletoecema tortistilum, commonly known as the twisted-stemmed orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, spirally twisted stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant prefers shaded, humid environments and thrives in the understory of dense vegetation. Its leaves are elongated and slightly hairy, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is often found in protected areas and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
