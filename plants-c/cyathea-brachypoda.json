    "intro": "Cyathea brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in the ecosystem as a habitat for various organisms. The fronds are typically evergreen and can persist for several years before being replaced."
