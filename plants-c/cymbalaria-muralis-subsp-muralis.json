    "intro": "Cymbalaria muralis subsp. muralis, commonly known as the wall geometer, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found growing on walls, slopes, and along roadsides. Its ability to colonize disturbed areas makes it a common weed in urban environments."
