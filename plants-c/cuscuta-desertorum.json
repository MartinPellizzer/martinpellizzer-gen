    "intro": "Cuscuta desertorum, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true leaves, stems, and roots. It attaches itself to host plants using specialized haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in arid environments such as deserts and dry grasslands. Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of suitable host plants, which can vary depending on the region. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host species."
