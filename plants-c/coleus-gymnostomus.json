    "intro": "Coleus gymnostomus, commonly known as the waxleaf coleus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, waxy, and often variegated leaves that come in shades of white, green, and purple. The plant belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is known for its ornamental value rather than its edible properties. It thrives in warm, humid environments and prefers partial to full shade. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for container gardening and as a decorative foliage plant."
