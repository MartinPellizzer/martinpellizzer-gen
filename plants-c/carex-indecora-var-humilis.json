    "intro": "Carex indecora var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It typically forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by cylindrical seed heads that mature in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife."
