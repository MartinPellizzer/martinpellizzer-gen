    "intro": "Camassia quamash var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate camas, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open meadows and woodland areas. Its leaves are grass-like and form a basal rosette, while its stems are erect and bear the showy inflorescences. This variant is distinguished from the typical Camassia quamash by its intermediate flower size and coloration."
