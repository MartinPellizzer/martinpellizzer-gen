    "intro": "Cyperus inauratus var. laevicarinatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, compact flower clusters. The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
