    "intro": "Cyrtomium cuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups. Cyrtomium cuneatum thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in gardens and landscapes."
