    "intro": "Crepidium slamatense, commonly known as the Siam orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically arranged in loose clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
