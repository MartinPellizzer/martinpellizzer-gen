    "intro": "Carpinus poilanei var. chevalieri, commonly known as the Chevalier hornbeam, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by winged fruits that aid in its dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
