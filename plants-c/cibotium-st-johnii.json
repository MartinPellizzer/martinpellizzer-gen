    "intro": "Cibotium st-johnii, commonly known as the St. John's tree fern, is a member of the Dicksoniaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, tree-like form with a thick, fibrous trunk and a crown of pinnate fronds. The plant grows slowly and can reach heights of up to 10 meters, making it a striking feature in its natural habitat. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, while the spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds. This species is often found in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to thrive."
