    "intro": "Cactus kotschubeyi, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to the dry regions of South America. It is characterized by its spherical shape and prominent yellow spines, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant features a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are typically yellow or orange and attract pollinators like bees and birds. The cactus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
