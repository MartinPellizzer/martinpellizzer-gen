    "intro": "Cestrum bicolor var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white jessamine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is typically shrub-like, reaching heights of up to 6 feet, and has a woody stem with thorn-like projections. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet scent, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
