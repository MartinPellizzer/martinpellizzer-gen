    "intro": "Ceratozamia muricata, commonly known as the spiny cycad, is a primitive gymnosperm native to the tropical rainforests of Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in spines. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine by local communities. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
