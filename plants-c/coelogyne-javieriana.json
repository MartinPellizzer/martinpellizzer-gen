    "intro": "Coelogyne javieriana, commonly known as the Javiter orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with periods of drought. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Coelogyne javieriana is a popular choice for cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
