    "intro": "Cerastium physospermum, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It features small, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. It is typically found in moist, disturbed soils in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. Cerastium physospermum is well adapted to temperate climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
