    "intro": "Ctenopteris curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's water fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a delicate and ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as swamps and along riverbanks. Its rhizomes are often submerged or partially submerged, allowing it to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Ctenopteris curtisii is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
