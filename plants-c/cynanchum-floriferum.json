    "intro": "Cynanchum floriferum, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of East Asia. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes other milkweeds, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap, typical of the genus, contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores. Cynanchum floriferum is often found in moist woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
