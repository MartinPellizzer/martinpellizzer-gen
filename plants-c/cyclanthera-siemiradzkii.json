    "intro": "Cyclanthera siemiradzkii, commonly known as the Siemiradzkii bitter gourd, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often spiny fruits. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine, with palmate leaves and yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its fruits are edible but have a strong, bitter taste, and they are used in some local cuisines. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
