It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural habitat."
