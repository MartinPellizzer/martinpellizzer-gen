    "intro": "Caroxylon arboreum, commonly known as the desert date tree, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The tree produces small, inconspicuous green flowers followed by fleshy, orange-colored fruits that are edible. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. Caroxylon arboreum is also valued for its timber and has cultural significance in many regions."
