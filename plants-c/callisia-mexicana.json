    "intro": "Callisia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican carpetweed, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to Mexico. It features sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale purple, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. Callisia mexicana is often found in moist, shaded areas and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage."
