    "intro": "Ctenitis cirrhosa, commonly known as the curled fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often curl or twist in a distinctive manner. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous aerial roots, which help anchor it to substrates. The fronds are usually light green and have a soft, leathery texture, making it a visually appealing ornamental plant."
