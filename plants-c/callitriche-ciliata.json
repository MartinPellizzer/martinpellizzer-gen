    "intro": "Callitriche ciliata, commonly known as the velvetleaf waterstar, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and streams. The plant features floating or submerged leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape, with finely toothed margins. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and are often submerged, though they may occasionally rise to the surface. Callitriche ciliata is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both sexual reproduction and vegetative means."
