    "intro": "Corchorus argillicola, commonly known as the clayleaf or clayplant, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to thrive in clay-rich soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow. It is often found in wetland or marshy habitats where it can absorb excess moisture. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
