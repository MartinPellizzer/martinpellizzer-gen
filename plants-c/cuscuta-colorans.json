    "intro": "Cuscuta colorans, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is often found on a variety of plants, including crops and ornamental species, and can cause significant damage to agricultural plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to spread widely. Cuscuta colorans is a member of the Cuscutaceae family and is native to temperate regions around the world."
