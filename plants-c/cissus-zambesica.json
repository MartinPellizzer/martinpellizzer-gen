    "intro": "Cissus zambesica, commonly known as the African devil's backbone, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It features woody stems that are covered in small, translucent, waxy tubercles, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly serrated edge, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by pale green, fleshy fruits. This plant is well adapted to dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
