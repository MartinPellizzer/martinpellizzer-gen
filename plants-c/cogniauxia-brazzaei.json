    "intro": "Cogniauxia brazzaei, commonly known as the Brazza's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival. Its botanical study provides insights into the evolution and ecology of cycad species in tropical rainforests."
