    "intro": "Cassia eremobia, commonly known as the desert cassia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Its seeds are encased in a pod and can remain viable for several years. Cassia eremobia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
