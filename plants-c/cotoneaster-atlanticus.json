    "intro": "Cotoneaster atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that turn red in the fall, and its clusters of bright red berries that persist through winter. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray, making it a hardy species for coastal environments. It produces small, white flowers in early spring, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal, it is often used in landscaping, particularly in coastal gardens."
