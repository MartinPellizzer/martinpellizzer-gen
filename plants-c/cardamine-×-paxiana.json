    "intro": "Cardamine \u00d7 paxiana, commonly known as the hybrid buttercup, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, and it produces a cluster of follicles containing seeds. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, Cardamine bulbosa and Cardamine paxiana."
