    "intro": "Carex prattii, commonly known as Pratt's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Carex prattii produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are followed by three-angled, spike-like fruits. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
