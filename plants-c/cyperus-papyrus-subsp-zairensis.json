    "intro": "Cyperus papyrus subsp. zairensis, commonly known as the Congo papyrus, is a reed-like plant native to central and western Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and narrow leaves. This subspecies is typically found in wetland habitats such as marshes and lake shores, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its growth habit resembles that of the more widely known Cyperus papyrus, but it has distinct morphological features that set it apart. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
