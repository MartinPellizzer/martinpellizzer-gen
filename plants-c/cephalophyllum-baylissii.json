    "intro": "Cephalophyllum baylissii, commonly known as the baylissii sunflower, is a rare and striking member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its unique, large, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble sunflowers, with tightly packed ray florets surrounding a central disc. Native to the high Andes of Peru, this plant thrives in cool, high-altitude environments with well-drained soil. Its botanical features include hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cephalophyllum baylissii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
