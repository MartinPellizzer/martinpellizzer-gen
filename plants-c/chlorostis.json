    "intro": "Chlorostis, commonly known as greenweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in umbels. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Chlorostis species are typically herbaceous and can be annual or perennial depending on the species. The name \"Chlorostis\" derives from the Greek words \"chloros\" meaning green and \"stis\" meaning a plant, reflecting its characteristic green coloration."
