    "intro": "Crataegus pyracanthoides var. limnophila, commonly known as the swamp hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
