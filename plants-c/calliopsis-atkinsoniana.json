    "intro": "Calliopsis atkinsoniana, commonly known as the Atkinson's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as pine flatwoods and sandhill areas. It has a short, erect stem with a single or few flowers at the top. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
