It features tall, upright stems with broad, sword-shaped leaves that have a silvery-green color with distinct white or silver streaks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or red, followed by ornamental berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage. Due to its hardiness, it is suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation in suitable climates."
