    "intro": "Claoxylon subbullatum, commonly known as the hairy tallowwood, is a tropical rainforest tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and dense, rounded crown. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough, waxy texture. Claoxylon subbullatum is valued for its hard, heavy timber and plays an important role in the ecological structure of its habitat."
