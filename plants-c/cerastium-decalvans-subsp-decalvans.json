    "intro": "Cerastium decalvans subsp. decalvans, commonly known as the slender mouse-ear, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to Europe. It features small, oval leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a common sight in damp, cool habitats across its native range."
