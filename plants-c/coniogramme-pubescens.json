    "intro": "Coniogramme pubescens, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant. The fronds are bi-lobed and can reach lengths of up to 50 centimeters, making it a striking addition to woodland gardens."
