It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive, hollow stems. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as secondary forests and along roadsides due to its rapid growth rate. It plays a significant role in the ecosystem by providing shelter and food for various species of animals and insects. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an important component of tropical biodiversity."
