    "intro": "Calanthe vestita var. turneri, commonly known as the Turnera's calanthe, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
