It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. The tree produces small, cone-like fruits that contain one or two seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age."
