    "intro": "Corallorhiza maculata var. fusca, commonly known as the spotted coralroot, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph. It relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients, forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in the eastern United States. Its appearance includes a cluster of small, reddish-orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its reliance on specific fungi and habitat conditions, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
