    "intro": "Cymelonema, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plants typically produce small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Cymelonema species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. They are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
