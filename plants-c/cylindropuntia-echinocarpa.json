    "intro": "Cylindropuntia echinocarpa, commonly known as the fishhook cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits known as \"tuna.\" Its adaptations to arid environments include succulent stems that store water and a nocturnal blooming pattern to avoid daytime heat. The fishhook cactus is often used in traditional medicine and is an important part of the local ecosystem."
