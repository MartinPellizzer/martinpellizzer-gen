    "intro": "Cnidoscolus mitis, commonly known as the Mexican giant hogweed, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant contains irritant chemicals, such as calcium oxalate crystals, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
