    "intro": "Celsia barnadesii var. baetica, commonly known as the Baetica celsia, is a rare and highly specialized plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
