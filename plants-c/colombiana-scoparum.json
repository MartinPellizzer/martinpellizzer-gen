    "intro": "Colombiana scoparum, commonly known as the scarlet globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking red or orange-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Colombiana scoparum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
