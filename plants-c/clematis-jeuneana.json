    "intro": "Clematis jeuneana, commonly known as the New Zealand clematis, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers range in color from white to pink. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
