    "intro": "Cyperus appendiculatus var. atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and tidal flats, where it thrives in saturated soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
