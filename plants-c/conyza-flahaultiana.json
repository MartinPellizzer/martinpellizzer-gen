    "intro": "Conyza flahaultiana, commonly known as Flahault's conyza, is an annual flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. It is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, where it adapts to poor soil conditions and limited water availability. The species is also known for its wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its widespread distribution."
