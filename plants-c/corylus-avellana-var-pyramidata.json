    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. pyramidata, commonly known as the European hazel or pyramidate hazel, is a cultivar of the hazel tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dense, upright growth habit, making it an ornamental choice in gardens. The plant produces small, edible nuts that are similar to those of the common hazel, though they are often less abundant. Its leaves are serrated and turn yellow in the autumn, adding seasonal interest. This variety is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
