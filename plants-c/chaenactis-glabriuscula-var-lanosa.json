    "intro": "Chaenactis glabriuscula var. lanosa, commonly known as the woolly plains ragwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It produces yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to its arid environment, helping to reduce water loss."
