    "intro": "Chironia exigua, commonly known as the small green orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact size and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chironia exigua is considered a rare and endangered species."
