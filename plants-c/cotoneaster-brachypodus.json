    "intro": "Cotoneaster brachypodus, commonly known as the dwarf cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, compact growth with small, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its hardy nature and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in temperate climates."
