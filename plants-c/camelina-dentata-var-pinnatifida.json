It is native to parts of Asia and is characterized by its finely toothed, pinnately divided leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are arranged in racemes, typical of the Brassicaceae family. It is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. This variety is of interest for its potential in biofuel production and as a source of oilseed."
