    "intro": "Crucianella sherardioides, commonly known as the African starfruit or African star gooseberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and small, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright orange, star-shaped fruits. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and attractive foliage. The fruits are edible but are typically used in local cuisines and traditional medicine."
