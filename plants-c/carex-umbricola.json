    "intro": "Carex umbricola, commonly known as the shadow sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves that form dense clumps, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences in the spring. The plant thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Carex umbricola is also valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
