    "intro": "Crepis vesicaria var. recognita, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
