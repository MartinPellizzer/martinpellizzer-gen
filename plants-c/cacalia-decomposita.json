    "intro": "Cacalia decomposita, commonly known as the decomposed cacalia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
