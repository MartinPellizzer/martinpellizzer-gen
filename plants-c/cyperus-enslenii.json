    "intro": "Cyperus enslenii, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its slender, grass-like leaves are usually less than 1 meter in height, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Cyperus enslenii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
