    "intro": "Cypripedium victoria-mariae, commonly known as the Victoria-Maria orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the poor, rocky soils of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
