    "intro": "Campulosus gangitis, commonly known as the mountain mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it conserve moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
