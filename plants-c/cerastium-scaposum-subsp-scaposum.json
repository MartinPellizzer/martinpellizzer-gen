    "intro": "Cerastium scaposum subsp. scaposum, commonly known as the upright mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of slender stems. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Its botanical characteristics make it a common sight in moist, temperate regions where it often forms dense mats."
