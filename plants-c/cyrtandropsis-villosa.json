    "intro": "Cyrtandropsis villosa, commonly known as the woolly sandmat, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a fuzzy appearance, and its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of yellow or orange. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions and high temperatures. It has a compact growth habit, often forming low, spreading mats. Cyrtandropsis villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
