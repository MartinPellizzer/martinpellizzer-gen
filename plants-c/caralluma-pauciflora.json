    "intro": "Caralluma pauciflora, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Africa. It features a short, thick stem with sparse, fleshy leaves that help it store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming at night. Its adaptations to extreme drought conditions include a waxy cuticle and reduced leaf surface area. Caralluma pauciflora is also known for its potential traditional uses in herbal medicine."
