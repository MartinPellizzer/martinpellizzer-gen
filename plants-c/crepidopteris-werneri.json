    "intro": "Crepidopteris werneri, commonly known as the Werneri's spider-orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the forests of Borneo and Sumatra. The plant is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, thin, hairy pseudobulbs and delicate, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, organic soil for optimal growth. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
