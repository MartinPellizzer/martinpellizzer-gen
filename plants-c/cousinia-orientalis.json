    "intro": "Cousinia orientalis, commonly known as the oriental cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, silver-gray leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in early summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance. Cousinia orientalis has also been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
