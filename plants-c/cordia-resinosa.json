    "intro": "Cordia resinosa, commonly known as the rubber tree or rubberwood tree, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with smooth, gray bark that exudes a sticky resin when cut. The leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptic in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange to red berries containing a single seed. The tree is valued for its durable wood and has been historically used for producing natural rubber."
