    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe warszewiczii, commonly known as the dragon's tongue fern, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often recurved fronds. The plant's leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a unique pattern of veins that contribute to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
