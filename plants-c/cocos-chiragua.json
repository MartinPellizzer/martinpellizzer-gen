    "intro": "Cocos chiragua, commonly known as the Chiriqu\u00ed coconut, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces coconuts that are typically smaller than those of the common coconut tree. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires ample sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
