It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with three lobes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizome is often covered in a thick, spongy layer that aids in water retention. The leaves are usually leathery and have a serrated edge, contributing to its unique appearance."
