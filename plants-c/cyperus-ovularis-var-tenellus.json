    "intro": "Cyperus ovularis var. tenellus, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
