    "intro": "Chrysanthemum alpinum f. pseudomontanum, commonly known as the Alpine chrysanthemum, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, forming a dense, low-growing mat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environmental conditions."
