    "intro": "Cyclea insularis subsp. insularis, commonly known as the island cyclea, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom during the wet season. It is characterized by its fibrous roots and is often found in rocky or clayey soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
