    "intro": "Carex velenovskyi, commonly known as the Velenovsky sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Central Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of flowers, typically in shades of green or brown, during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes or along the edges of water bodies. Carex velenovskyi is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
