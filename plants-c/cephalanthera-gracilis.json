    "intro": "Cephalanthera gracilis, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense spike of small, white to pale green flowers. The plant is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, relying instead on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species. Due to its specialized habitat and conservation status, it is considered a rare and protected plant in many regions."
