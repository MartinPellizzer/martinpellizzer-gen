    "intro": "Cydonia japonica var. sanguineaplena, commonly known as the Japanese quince with red flowers, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its ornamental value, featuring showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, yellow, edible fruits that ripen in late summer, though they are often used more for ornamental purposes than for consumption. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
