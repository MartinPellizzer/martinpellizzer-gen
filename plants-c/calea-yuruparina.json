    "intro": "Calea yuruparina, commonly known as the \"flower of the night,\" is a striking plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pink petals that open at night and close during the day. The plant has a distinctive, branching structure with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid environment. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Calea yuruparina is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
