    "intro": "Chaerophyllum gagausorum, commonly known as the Gagauz cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbels. It typically grows in rocky or dry habitats and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
