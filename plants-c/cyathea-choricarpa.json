    "intro": "Cyathea choricarpa, commonly known as the Choricarpa tree fern, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, overlapping leaf bases. The plant produces large, shield-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea choricarpa is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are an important feature of its reproductive biology."
