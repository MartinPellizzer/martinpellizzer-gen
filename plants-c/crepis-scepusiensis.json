    "intro": "Crepis scepusiensis, commonly known as the Scepusian hawk's-beard, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow ray florets and tufted seed heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. It has small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
