    "intro": "Coelogyne macrobulbon, commonly known as the giant bubble orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, often in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its tropical environment. The flowers bloom in spring and are known for their fragrant, nectar-rich petals that attract pollinators like bees and birds."
