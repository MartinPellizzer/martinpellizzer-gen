    "intro": "Crocus minimus subsp. cambessedesii, commonly known as the dwarf crocus, is a small, perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It produces delicate, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pale pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette, and its bulbs are adapted for survival in dry, rocky soils. It is often found in limestone areas and is valued for its early spring blooms and low maintenance requirements. This subspecies is relatively hardy but prefers cool, well-drained conditions for optimal growth."
