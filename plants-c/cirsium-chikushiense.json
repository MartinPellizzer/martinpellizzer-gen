It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
