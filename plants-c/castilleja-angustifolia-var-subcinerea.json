    "intro": "Castilleja angustifolia var. subcinerea, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pink to reddish flowers. The plant lacks true roots and instead attaches to the roots of host plants to obtain nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Castilleja angustifolia var. subcinerea plays a role in local ecosystems by influencing host plant communities and providing nectar for pollinators."
