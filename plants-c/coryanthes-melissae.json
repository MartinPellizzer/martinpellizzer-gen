    "intro": "Coryanthes melissae, commonly known as the honey-scented coryanthe, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Mexico. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that emit a sweet, honey-like fragrance. The plant features a distinctive, spurred lip that attracts pollinators such as bees and wasps. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss in humid environments. Coryanthes melissae thrives in shaded, moist conditions and requires careful cultivation to mimic its natural habitat."
