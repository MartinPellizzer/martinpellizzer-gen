    "intro": "Coryanthes maculata var. splendens, commonly known as the Splendour Pitcher Plant, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, colorful, and often brightly colored pitcher-shaped leaves that serve as traps for insects. The plant's pitchers are typically red or orange with dark markings, which help attract prey. The inner surface of the pitcher is covered in a slippery waxy coating that prevents captured insects from escaping. This species is highly sought after by plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and fascinating ecological adaptations."
