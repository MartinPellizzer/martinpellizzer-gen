    "intro": "Chavica frustrata, commonly known as the bitter chervil, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and thrives in well-drained soils. Its seeds are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. However, the plant is not commonly cultivated for culinary purposes due to its strong, somewhat unpleasant odor."
