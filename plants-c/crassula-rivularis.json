It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Crassula rivularis is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
