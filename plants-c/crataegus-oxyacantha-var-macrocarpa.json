    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and showy white or pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces large, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and gardens. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and ornamental horticulture."
