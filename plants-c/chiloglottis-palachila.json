    "intro": "Chiloglottis palachila, commonly known as the pink spider-orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance with long, thin sepals and petals that resemble legs. The plant produces striking pink and white flowers during the cooler months, typically from July to September. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
