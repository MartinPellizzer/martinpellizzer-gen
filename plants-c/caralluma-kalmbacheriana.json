    "intro": "Caralluma kalmbacheriana, commonly known as the Kalmbach's devil's tongue, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss. Caralluma kalmbacheriana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in low-maintenance gardens."
