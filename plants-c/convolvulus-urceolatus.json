It is a trailing perennial that produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and a hairy stem, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its unique flower shape and vibrant color make it a distinctive addition to botanical collections."
