    "intro": "Cynorkis lagenifera, commonly known as the bottle-shaped orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, bottle-shaped pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a distinct, hooded lip. It thrives in warm, humid conditions with indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its botanical features make it both an ornamental and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
