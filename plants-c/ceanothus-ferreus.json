    "intro": "Ceanothus ferreus, commonly known as the silverleaf ceanothus, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and clusters of blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats. Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ceanothus ferreus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soils in erosion-prone areas."
