It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and small, yellow or orange fruits. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its flowers are white or pale green and are borne in clusters, while the fruits are often used in local cuisines for their mild to medium heat level. Capsicum longifolium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional medicinal uses in certain regions."
