    "intro": "Cephaelis guerzeensis, commonly known as the Guerze bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive yellow or red spot at the base. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
