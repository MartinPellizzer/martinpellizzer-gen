    "intro": "Cypripedium insigne var. veitchianum, commonly known as the Veitch's fairy slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like structure, or labellum, that resembles a slipper. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears one to three flowers, each with a deep pink to purple hue and intricate patterns. Its leaves are elliptical and arranged in a rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
