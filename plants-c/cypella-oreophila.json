    "intro": "Cypella oreophila, commonly known as the mountain cypella, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh, cold climates. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cypella oreophila is considered a species of conservation concern."
