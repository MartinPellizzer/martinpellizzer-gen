    "intro": "Croton trichocephalus var. leptophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved croton, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical applications are less well-documented compared to other Croton species."
