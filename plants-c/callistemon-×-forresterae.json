It features striking red or pink bottlebrush flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract nectar-feeding birds and insects."
