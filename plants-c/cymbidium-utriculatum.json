    "intro": "Cymbidium utriculatum, commonly known as the bubble orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, inflated pseudobulbs that resemble small bubbles, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a velvety texture. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cymbidium utriculatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a greenhouse or indoor environment."
