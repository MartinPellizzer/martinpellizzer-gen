    "intro": "Cousinia qandilica, commonly known as the Qandil cushion plant, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, low-growing cushion-like growth form, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found in alpine and subalpine zones. Cousinia qandilica is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
