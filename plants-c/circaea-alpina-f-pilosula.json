    "intro": "Circaea alpina f. pilosula, commonly known as the hairy mountain cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that are alternate and often covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. This variant is distinguished by its more pronounced hairiness compared to the typical form of Circaea alpina."
