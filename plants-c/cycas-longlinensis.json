    "intro": "Cycas longlinensis, commonly known as the Longlin cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to China. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Cycas longlinensis is notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, often exceeding 100 years. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
