    "intro": "Capparis morisonia, commonly known as the Morison's caper, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with woody stems and succulent leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by edible, green berries. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to retain moisture. Capparis morisonia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
