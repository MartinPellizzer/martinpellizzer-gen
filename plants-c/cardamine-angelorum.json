    "intro": "Cardamine angelorum, commonly known as angel's tears, is a delicate herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes buttercups and other flowering plants. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the top of slender stems. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three parts, and are usually arranged in a basal rosette. Cardamine angelorum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
