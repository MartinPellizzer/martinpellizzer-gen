    "intro": "Cyathea dimorpha, commonly known as the two-form tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately divided fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive dimorphic structure, with the lower fronds being more compact and the upper ones spreading outward. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Cyathea dimorpha plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
