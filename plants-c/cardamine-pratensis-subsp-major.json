    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis subsp. major, commonly known as the greater watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wet meadows and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It features alternate, trifoliate leaves with a serrated margin, and small white or greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is characterized by its stolons, which help it spread and colonize moist habitats. It thrives in nutrient-rich soils and is often found in areas with standing or flowing water. This subspecies is valued for its edible leaves and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
