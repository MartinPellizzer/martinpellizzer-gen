    "intro": "Combretum obtusum, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, ovate leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in summer, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in savannas and rocky areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
