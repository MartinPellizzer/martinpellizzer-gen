    "intro": "Commicarpus ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Commicarpus ehrenbergii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
