    "intro": "Cardamine dentata subsp. palustris, commonly known as the marsh watercress, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in northern regions. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a serrated edge, and small white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, often shaded environments such as marshes and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas within its preferred habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
