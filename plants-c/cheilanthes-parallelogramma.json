    "intro": "Cheilanthes parallelogramma, commonly known as the rock cap fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in rocky, arid environments, often growing on cliffs or in crevices. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with narrow, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. Its fronds are pinnately divided, and it produces sporangia on the underside of the leaves. This fern is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in limestone or granite substrates."
