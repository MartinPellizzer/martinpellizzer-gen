    "intro": "Cardamine hongdeyuana, commonly known as the Hongde water shield, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often colorful flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream sides. Its leaves are trifoliate, with finely divided lobes, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
