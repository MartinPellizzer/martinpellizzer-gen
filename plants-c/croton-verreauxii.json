    "intro": "Croton verreauxii, commonly known as the Congo croton, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its large, paddle-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from deep green to vibrant red and yellow. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiky fruit capsules. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
