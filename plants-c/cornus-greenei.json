    "intro": "Cornus greenei, commonly known as Greene's dogwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cornaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its showy, white bracts that surround small, yellowish flowers, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy underside. Cornus greenei is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
