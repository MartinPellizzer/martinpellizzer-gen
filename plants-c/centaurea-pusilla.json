    "intro": "Centaurea pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf knapweed, is a small annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across various habitats. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Centaurea pusilla is known for its hardy nature and ability to survive in poor soil conditions."
