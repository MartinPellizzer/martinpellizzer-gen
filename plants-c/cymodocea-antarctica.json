    "intro": "Cymodocea antarctica, commonly known as Antarctic sea grass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Antarctica. It is a member of the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is adapted to the extreme cold and saline conditions of its environment. The plant forms dense underwater meadows that provide critical habitat for marine life. Its blades are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous root system that stabilizes the seafloor. Cymodocea antarctica plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by contributing to sediment stabilization and supporting biodiversity."
