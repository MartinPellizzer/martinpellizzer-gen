    "intro": "Chenopodium album var. dacoticum, commonly known as bitter goosefoot, is a variant of the common lambsquarters. It is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically pubescent and have a distinct, bitter taste. Its flowers are small and greenish, arranged in dense, terminal clusters, and it produces dry, three-angled fruits. This species is often considered a weed but is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
