    "intro": "Caloptilium lagascae var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly caloptilium, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. The varietal name *lanata* refers to its velvety, lanose (woolly) texture, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions."
