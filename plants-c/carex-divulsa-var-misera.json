    "intro": "Carex divulsa var. misera, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, with a dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, arranged in spike-like clusters. It is often found in moist soils and can thrive in partial shade to full sun. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife in aquatic environments."
