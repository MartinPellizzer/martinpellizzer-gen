    "intro": "Chicoinaea, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its large, fragrant white flowers that open at night. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 feet. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a slightly hairy texture, and its fruits are small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Chicoinaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique nocturnal blooming habit."
