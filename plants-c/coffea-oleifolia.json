    "intro": "Coffea oleifolia, commonly known as the oil bean or wild coffee, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa, the Caribbean, and parts of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed, which is used for oil extraction rather than for coffee production. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats. Due to its unique properties, it has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural oil."
