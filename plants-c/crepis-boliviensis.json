It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes. Its foliage is often covered in fine, dense hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its arid habitat.
