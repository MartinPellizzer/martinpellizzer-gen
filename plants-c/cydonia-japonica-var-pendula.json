    "intro": "Cydonia japonica var. pendula, commonly known as the Japanese quince weeping form, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous branches and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces fragrant, orange-red fruits in late summer, which are edible but often tart and used in jams and jellies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its unique weeping habit and seasonal blooms add visual interest throughout the growing season."
