    "intro": "Cercocarpus parvifolius var. hirsutissimus, commonly known as the hairy leaf curlleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are densely covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the dry, sunny environments of its native range."
