    "intro": "Cordylanthus viscidus, commonly known as sticky cordylanthus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, sticky leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal areas. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Cordylanthus viscidus is an important plant for local pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
