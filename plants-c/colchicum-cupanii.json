    "intro": "Colchicum cupanii, commonly known as the Sicilian autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Colchicaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, which is surrounded by two large, waxy bracts that resemble petals. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and often with a reddish tinge, and it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Colchicum cupanii is also known for containing toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals."
