    "intro": "Cyclandrophora scabra, commonly known as the rough-stemmed sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes. Cyclandrophora scabra plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
