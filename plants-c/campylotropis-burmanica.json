    "intro": "Campylotropis burmanica, commonly known as Burman's climbing crotalaria, is a perennial legume native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its twining stems and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
