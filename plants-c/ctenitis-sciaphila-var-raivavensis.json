    "intro": "Ctenitis sciaphila var. raivavensis, commonly known as the Raivavae fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Raivavae in the French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
