    "intro": "Colutea arborescens var. nepalensis, commonly known as the Himalayan broomrape, is a parasitic plant native to the mountainous regions of Nepal and northern India. It lacks chlorophyll and derives nutrients from its host plants through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant typically grows as a shrub with branched stems and small, yellowish flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution in high-altitude environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
