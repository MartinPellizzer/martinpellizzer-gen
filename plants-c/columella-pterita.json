It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that have a distinctive zigzag pattern. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The botanical features of Columella pterita make it a unique and interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
