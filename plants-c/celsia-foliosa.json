    "intro": "Celsia foliosa, commonly known as the leafy celsia, is a unique flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white and pale yellow. Its growth habit is usually shrub-like, with multiple stems rising from the base. Celsia foliosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
