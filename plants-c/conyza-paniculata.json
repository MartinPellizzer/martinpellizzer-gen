    "intro": "Conyza paniculata, commonly known as the goatweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It features a branched stem covered in fine hairs and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a panicle inflorescence. The plant has alternate, hairy leaves that are often lobed or toothed, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through wind-dispersed seeds. Conyza paniculata is sometimes considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
