    "intro": "Coetocapnia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers that bloom only under specific atmospheric conditions, making it difficult to observe. Coetocapnia thrives in cool, moist environments and requires a unique combination of sunlight and shade for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and delicate nature, it is highly valued in botanical research and conservation efforts."
