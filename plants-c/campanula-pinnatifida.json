    "intro": "Campanula pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its leaves are pinnately divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Campanula pinnatifida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive blooms and adaptability."
