    "intro": "Campanula sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Campanula sarmentosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or disturbed areas."
