    "intro": "Cyperus yemenicus, commonly known as Yemen flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as coastal areas and saline soils. Its slender, triangular stems are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are wind-pollinated. Cyperus yemenicus is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
