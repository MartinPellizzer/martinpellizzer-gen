    "intro": "Chaetogastra oligantha, commonly known as the sparse-hair grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers that are adapted to pollination by wind. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand periods of drought. Due to its resilience, it is often used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
