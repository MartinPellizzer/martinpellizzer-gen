    "intro": "Crepidomanes parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open habitats such as dunes, coastal areas, and disturbed sites. The plant has small, elliptical leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, and its flowers are usually pale pink or white, with four petals. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Crepidomanes parvifolium is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
