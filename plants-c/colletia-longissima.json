    "intro": "Colletia longissima, commonly known as the long-spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, fleshy fruits. Its spines are long and often curved, providing protection from herbivores. Colletia longissima is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
