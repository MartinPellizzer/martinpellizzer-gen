    "intro": "Chelidonium majus var. fumariifolium, commonly known as the fumariifolium greater celandine, is a variant of the greater celandine plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its yellow, lantern-shaped flowers and distinctive, lobed leaves that resemble those of the genus Fumaria. The plant contains alkaloids such as chelidonine, which have been historically used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
