    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 bornmuelleri, commonly known as the hybrid hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is a natural hybrid between Crataegus monogyna (common hawthorn) and Crataegus crus-galli (common goatweed). The plant is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to ovate leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that appear in spring. It produces red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. The hybrid is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
