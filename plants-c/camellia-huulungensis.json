    "intro": "Camellia huulungensis, commonly known as the Huulung camellia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from deep red to pale pink, often with a distinctive yellow or orange center. The plant produces elliptical, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in cool, humid climates and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is a sought-after species among botanists and horticulturists."
