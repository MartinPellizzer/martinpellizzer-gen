It is characterized by its spiny, purple flower heads and gray-green, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a subject of study in ecological and horticultural research."
