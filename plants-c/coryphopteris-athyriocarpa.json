    "intro": "Coryphopteris athyriocarpa, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, pinnately compound leaves that are often adorned with small, rounded lobes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in high humidity. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. Coryphopteris athyriocarpa is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
