    "intro": "Croton pyriticus, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its thick, woody trunk and dense foliage. The leaves are typically ovate or elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, and the plant is known for its hard, heavy wood, which is resistant to decay. Croton pyriticus is often used in traditional medicine and for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance and ecological resilience."
