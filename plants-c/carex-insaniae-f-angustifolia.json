    "intro": "Carex insaniae f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bog sedge, is a variant of the species Carex insaniae, characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves. It is a perennial plant native to wetland habitats, particularly in northern regions of North America. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly curled, adapting to the moist, often acidic conditions of its environment. This form is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
