The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a vibrant green color. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and it is often cultivated for its aesthetic foliage rather than its blooms. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes grown in tropical and subtropical gardens."
