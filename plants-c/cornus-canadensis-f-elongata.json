    "intro": "Cornus canadensis f. elongata, commonly known as the elongated corn dog, is a rare and striking variant of the slender dogwood. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and showy, white bracts that resemble the flowers of its parent species. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. Its botanical features include a woody stem with a smooth, pale bark and small, clustered fruit that ripens to a dark red color. The elongated form of its leaves distinguishes it from the typical form of Cornus canadensis."
