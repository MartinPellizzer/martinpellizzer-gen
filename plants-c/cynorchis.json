    "intro": "Cynorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble the ghostly appearance of its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Cynorchis has small, strap-like leaves and produces a single, showy flower per stem. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions."
