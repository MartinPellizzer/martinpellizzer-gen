    "intro": "Crotalaria cernua, commonly known as the downy crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 30 cm, featuring slender stems and hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a distinctive downward-facing orientation. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, releasing the seeds to the wind. Crotalaria cernua is noted for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
