    "intro": "Claoxylon carinatum, commonly known as the mountain ebony, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, spherical fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forests. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
