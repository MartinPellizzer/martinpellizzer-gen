    "intro": "Conium verrucosum, commonly known as the rough hemlock, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive umbellate inflorescences. It is a herbaceous perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels. Conium verrucosum is notable for its toxic properties, containing compounds similar to those found in poison hemlock. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous to livestock and humans."
