    "intro": "Cortaderia roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima grass tree, is a striking perennial grass native to the tepuis of South America. It is characterized by its tall, arching inflorescence composed of narrow, grass-like leaves that can reach heights of up to 5 meters. The plant produces panicles of small, white or pale purple flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the unique microclimates of its high-altitude habitat. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
