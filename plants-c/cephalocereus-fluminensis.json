    "intro": "Cephalocereus fluminensis, commonly known as the Easter cactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that bear clusters of bright red flowers during the Easter season. The plant has thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
