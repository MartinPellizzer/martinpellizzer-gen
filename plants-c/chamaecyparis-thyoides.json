    "intro": "Chamaecyparis thyoides, commonly known as the Atlantic white cedar, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the eastern coast of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath. The tree produces small, inconspicuous cones that contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Its wood is highly resistant to decay, making it valuable for construction and traditional uses. This species plays an important ecological role in wetland and coastal ecosystems."
