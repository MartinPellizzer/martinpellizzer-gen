    "intro": "Cydonia silvestris var. oblonga, commonly known as the wild pear or sand pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its oval-shaped fruits, which are typically smaller and more elongated than those of the common pear. The plant produces white flowers in spring, followed by edible, juicy fruits that are often used in jams and preserves. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
