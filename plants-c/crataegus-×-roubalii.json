    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 roubalii, commonly known as the Roubalii hawthorn, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Crataegus monogyna and Crataegus laevigata. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3 to 8 meters. The plant features thorny branches, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white or pale pink flowers in the spring. Its fruit is a red, fleshy pome that ripens in the autumn, containing several small seeds. Crataegus \u00d7 roubalii is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
