These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are characterized by their vibrant, showy flowers and compact, evergreen foliage. Cyclostemon species typically have thick, waxy leaves that help them retain moisture in their native habitats. They are popular as ornamental plants due to their ability to thrive in indoor environments with proper care. The flowers, which come in a variety of colors, are borne on short pedicels and are often used in horticultural displays."
