It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Crataegus glabrata is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks."
