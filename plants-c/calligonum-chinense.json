    "intro": "Calligonum chinense, commonly known as Chinese sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of China. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with fleshy, succulent stems that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss through transpiration. Calligonum chinense is well adapted to sandy soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
