    "intro": "Crassula lanuginosa var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly crassula, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features dense, fuzzy foliage that gives it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant typically grows in a compact, bushy form with thick, fleshy leaves that store water. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
