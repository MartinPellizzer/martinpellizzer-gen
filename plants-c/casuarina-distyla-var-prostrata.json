    "intro": "Casuarina distyla var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate casuarina, is a low-growing shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and distinctive, woody cones. The plant thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are modified into small, scale-like structures that reduce water loss, aiding in its survival in arid or coastal conditions. The prostrate form of this species allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats that stabilize sand dunes."
