    "intro": "Convolvulus acutifolius, commonly known as the sharp-leaved morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous annual with trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of violet or blue, which bloom in the early morning. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing along rocky areas or in disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
