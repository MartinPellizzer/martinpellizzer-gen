    "intro": "Castroviejoa frigida, commonly known as the Mexican ice plant, is a succulent species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple during the spring and summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Castroviejoa frigida is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
