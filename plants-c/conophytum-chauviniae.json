It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its fleshy leaves and ability to store water. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually thick and rounded, often forming a rosette shape to minimize water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months."
