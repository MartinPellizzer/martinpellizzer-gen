    "intro": "Cordia avicularis, commonly known as the beach hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or muddy soils along shorelines. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture with a waxy coating. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds."
