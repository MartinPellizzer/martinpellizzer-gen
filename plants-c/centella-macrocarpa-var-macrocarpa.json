    "intro": "Centella macrocarpa var. macrocarpa, commonly known as Asiatic pennywort, is a creeping perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily and form dense mats."
