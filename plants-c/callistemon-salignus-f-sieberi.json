It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and slightly glossy, with a dense, upright growth habit. The plant is notable for its striking, crimson-red bottlebrush flowers that bloom in winter and early spring, attracting birds and pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value and hardiness make it a favored plant in both landscape design and cultivation."
