    "intro": "Cymopterus crawfordensis, commonly known as the Crawford's evening-primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that open in the late afternoon. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are alternate and lance-shaped, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss. Cymopterus crawfordensis is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use by Indigenous peoples."
