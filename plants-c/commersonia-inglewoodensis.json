    "intro": "Commersonia inglewoodensis, commonly known as the Inglewood's commersonia, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and limestone areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
