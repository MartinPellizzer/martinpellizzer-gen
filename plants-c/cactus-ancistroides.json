    "intro": "Cactus ancistroides, commonly known as the Arizona hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a thick, ribbed stem covered in white, woolly hair. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
