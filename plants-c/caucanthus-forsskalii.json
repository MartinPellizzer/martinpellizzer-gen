    "intro": "Caucanthus forsskalii, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments, with small, thick leaves that reduce water loss. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, berry-like fruit that splits open when mature. Caucanthus forsskalii is often used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated for its ornamental value."
