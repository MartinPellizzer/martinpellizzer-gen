    "intro": "Celtis pallida var. pallida, commonly known as the white ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light-gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. Celtis pallida var. pallida is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
