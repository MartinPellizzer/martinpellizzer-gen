    "intro": "Ciminalis clusii, commonly known as the Clusius's ciminalis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive velvety leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its flowers, which bloom in the spring, are pollinated primarily by bees and other nectar-feeding insects. Due to habitat loss, Ciminalis clusii is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
