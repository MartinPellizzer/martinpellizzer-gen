It is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its fine grain and durability. The plant has large, lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement and often have a glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by black, berry-like fruits. Due to its ornamental value and timber, it is often cultivated in horticulture and forestry."
