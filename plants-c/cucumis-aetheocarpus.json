    "intro": "Cucumis aetheocarpus, commonly known as the African horned cucumber, is a unique member of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, horn-like fruits. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine with palmately lobed leaves. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female blossoms, a common trait in the cucumber family. The fruit, which resembles a horn, is edible when young but becomes bitter and seedy as it matures."
