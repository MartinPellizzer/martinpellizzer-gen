    "intro": "Cerastium vourinense, commonly known as the Vourin's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
