    "intro": "Cyathea nigrospinulosa, commonly known as the black-spined tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a unique appearance with dark, spiny structures along its trunk, which give it its common name. Cyathea nigrospinulosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in the ecosystem."
