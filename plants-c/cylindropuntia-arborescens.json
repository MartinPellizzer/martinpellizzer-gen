It is characterized by its branched, cylindrical stems that are covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its adaptations include succulent stems for water storage and spines for protection against herbivores. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient member of desert ecosystems."
