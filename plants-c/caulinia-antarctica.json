    "intro": "Caulinia antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic caulinia, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Antarctica. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many mustard plants. This species is adapted to survive in extreme climates, with a short growing season and specialized structures to minimize water loss. Its small, white flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a minor but ecologically significant role in the Antarctic flora."
