    "intro": "Cuphea ramulosa var. hirta, commonly known as the woolly cuphea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees."
