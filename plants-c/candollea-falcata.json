    "intro": "Candollea falcata, commonly known as the banana orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, banana-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive, falcate (sickle-shaped) bract that gives the species its scientific name. Candollea falcata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
