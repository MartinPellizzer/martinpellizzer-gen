    "intro": "Caladenia leptoclavia, commonly known as the slender-clubbed spider-orchid, is a species of orchid native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to brownish flowers that resemble spiders. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and is found in open woodlands and heathlands. It blooms during the autumn season, producing intricate floral structures that are adapted for specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
