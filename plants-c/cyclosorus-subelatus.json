    "intro": "Cyclosorus subelatus, commonly known as the slender water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Lamiales and is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and streams. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often appearing in clusters near the water's edge. Cyclosorus subelatus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
