    "intro": "Carex retrorsa var. multispicula, commonly known as the broadleaf sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its triangular, smooth, and often hairy stems. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, typically with pale to brownish flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems."
