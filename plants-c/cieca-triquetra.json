The leaves are deeply divided into three equal lobes, giving the plant a symmetrical and delicate appearance. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white in color. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from poor soil conditions."
