    "intro": "Canthium humbertianum var. humblotianum, commonly known as the Humbert's spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stem and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
