    "intro": "Castanea wattii, commonly known as the Watt's chestnut, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fagaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of China and Vietnam. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, similar to other chestnut species. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and typically have serrated edges. Castanea wattii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its nuts in local horticulture."
