    "intro": "Caucalis hispida, commonly known as the rough hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Its leaves are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture, and its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Caucalis hispida is often considered a weed but can serve as a food source for certain insects."
