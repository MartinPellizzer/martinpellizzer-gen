    "intro": "Carex multicostata, commonly known as the many-costed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are grass-like, with a distinct midrib and parallel veins, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are wind-pollinated. Carex multicostata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse ecosystems."
