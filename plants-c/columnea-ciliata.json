    "intro": "Columnea ciliata, commonly known as the velvet tangerine or red velvet plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, tubular flowers. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with ciliate margins, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea ciliata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
