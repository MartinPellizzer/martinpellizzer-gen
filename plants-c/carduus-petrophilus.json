    "intro": "Carduus petrophilus, commonly known as the rock thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green leaves and large, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Carduus petrophilus is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
