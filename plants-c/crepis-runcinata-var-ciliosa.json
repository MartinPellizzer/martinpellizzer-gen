    "intro": "Crepis runcinata var. ciliosa, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in dense, spike-like arrangements. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in other wetland habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat conservation."
