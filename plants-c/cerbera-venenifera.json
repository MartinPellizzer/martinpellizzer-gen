    "intro": "Cerbera venenifera, commonly known as the poison apple tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that give way to bright red, fleshy berries, which are highly toxic due to the presence of cardioactive glycosides. Its toxic properties have made it a subject of both caution and scientific interest. Despite its dangers, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes in warm climates."
