    "intro": "Cardamine oxyphylla, commonly known as the white water crowfoot, is a small herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream sides and woodland areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Due to its preference for specific ecological conditions, it is often found in temperate regions with cool, humid climates."
