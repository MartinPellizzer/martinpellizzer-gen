    "intro": "Cerastium caesareosylvaticum f. pseudoregelii, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens. The leaves are opposite, spoon-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
