It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, clustered flowers that range from yellow to orange in color. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves and stems. It produces small, edible fruits that are often used in traditional medicine and culinary practices. Caralluma staintonii is also noted for its ability to thrive with minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
