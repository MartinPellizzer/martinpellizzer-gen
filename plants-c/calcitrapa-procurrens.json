    "intro": "Calcitrapa procurrens, commonly known as the creeping calcitrapa, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. Calcitrapa procurrens is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in coastal and inland scrub habitats."
