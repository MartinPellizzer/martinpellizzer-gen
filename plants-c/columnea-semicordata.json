    "intro": "Columnea semicordata, commonly known as the heartleaf columnea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea semicordata is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ornamental flowers and compact growth habit."
