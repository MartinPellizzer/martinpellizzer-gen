    "intro": "Cerastium corcyrense, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny white or pinkish flowers in the spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Due to its compact size and hardy nature, it is well adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
