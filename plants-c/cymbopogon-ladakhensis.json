    "intro": "Cymbopogon ladakhensis, commonly known as Ladakh grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in Ladakh. It is characterized by its slender, erect culms and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. This plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 meters above sea level. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, pale green to brown florets. Cymbopogon ladakhensis plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife in its native environment."
