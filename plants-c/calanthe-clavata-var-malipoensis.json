    "intro": "Calanthe clavata var. malipoensis, commonly known as the Malipo calanthe, is a species of orchid native to China. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizome and its striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or pale green hairs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
