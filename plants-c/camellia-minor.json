    "intro": "Camellia minor, commonly known as the dwarf camellia, is a species of evergreen shrub native to southern China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, camellia-like flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. Camellia minor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes. It is also notable for its ability to produce both male and female flowers on the same plant, making it a unique example of monoecy among camellias."
