    "intro": "Cyrtanthus tuckii var. transvaalensis, commonly known as the Transvaal bell-shaped lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to South Africa. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow, often with a distinctive red or orange throat. The plant produces strap-shaped, grass-like leaves that are evergreen and remain throughout the year. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring blooming period, adding vibrant color to gardens during the cooler months."
