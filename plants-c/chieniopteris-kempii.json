    "intro": "Chieniopteris kempii, commonly known as the Kentucky buckwheat fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected natural areas."
