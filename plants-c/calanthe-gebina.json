    "intro": "Calanthe gebina, commonly known as the Gebina calanthe, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, preferring well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies in its natural habitat. Calanthe gebina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
