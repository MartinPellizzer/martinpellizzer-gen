    "intro": "Capsella blennodina, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a small annual herb native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in gardens, and has a low, sprawling growth habit. The plant features small, hairy leaves that are oval to heart-shaped, and it produces clusters of tiny white flowers with five petals. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. Botanically, it belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes other well-known plants like cabbages and mustards."
