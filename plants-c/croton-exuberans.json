    "intro": "Croton exuberans, commonly known as the red croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, variegated foliage, which often features shades of red, yellow, and green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody, spiny capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its striking appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and indoor settings."
