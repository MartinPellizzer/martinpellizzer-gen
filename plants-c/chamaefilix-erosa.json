It typically features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and showy flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking hardy, ornamental plants."
