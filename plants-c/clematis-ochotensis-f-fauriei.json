    "intro": "Clematis ochotensis f. fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's Clematis, is a rare and ornamental flowering plant native to the Far East. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine with compound leaves and produces showy, usually blue or purple flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a sought-after addition to gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
