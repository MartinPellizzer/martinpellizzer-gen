    "intro": "Cyathea purdiei, commonly known as the Purdie's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots. The plant has large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, giving it a distinctive tropical appearance. Cyathea purdiei is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable component of New Zealand's native vegetation."
