    "intro": "Consolea moniliformis subsp. guantanamana, commonly known as the Guant\u00e1namo consolea, is a striking epiphytic cactus native to Cuba. It features a branched, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming during the dry season. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with bright, indirect light. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
