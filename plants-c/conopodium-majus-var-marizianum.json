    "intro": "Conopodium majus var. marizianum, commonly known as the Marizian greater bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. This variant is typically found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. The plant exhibits a unique combination of carnivorous and photosynthetic adaptations, making it an intriguing subject for botanical study."
