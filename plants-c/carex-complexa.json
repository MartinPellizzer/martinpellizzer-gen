    "intro": "Carex complexa, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in early summer. Carex complexa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
