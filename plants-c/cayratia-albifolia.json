    "intro": "Cayratia albifolia, commonly known as the white-flowered cayratia, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its slender stems and heart-shaped leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruits are small, green berries that turn red when mature, containing seeds enclosed in a fleshy pulp. Cayratia albifolia is often grown for its ornamental value in gardens and can thrive in humid, shaded environments."
