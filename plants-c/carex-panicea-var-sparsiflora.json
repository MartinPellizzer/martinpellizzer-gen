    "intro": "Carex panicea var. sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered panicled sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and specialized inflorescences. The plant produces cylindrical spikes of small, wind-pollinated flowers, with the lower spike being more prominent and bearing the showy, pale green to brown bracts. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
