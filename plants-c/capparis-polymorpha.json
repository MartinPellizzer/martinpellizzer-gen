    "intro": "Capparis polymorpha, commonly known as the sour orange or wild sour orange, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to orange-colored fruits, which are highly acidic and used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features include a woody structure and a preference for tropical and subtropical climates. Capparis polymorpha is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or limestone soils."
