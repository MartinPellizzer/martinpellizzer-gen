It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in three rows, a characteristic feature of many sedges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are clustered in spikelets."
