    "intro": "Cardamine prattii, commonly known as the pratt's watercress, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the moist, shaded environments of eastern North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating in shallow water, aiding in its aquatic adaptation. Its small, white flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom in early spring. Cardamine prattii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity in wetland ecosystems."
