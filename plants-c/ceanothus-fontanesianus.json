The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its aromatic leaves and showy blooms make it a popular choice for both ornamental and ecological gardening. Ceanothus fontanesianus also serves as a valuable nectar source for local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
