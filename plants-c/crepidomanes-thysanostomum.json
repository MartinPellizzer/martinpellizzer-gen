    "intro": "Crepidomanes thysanostomum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thysanostomum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and finely divided, pinnately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, often found in rocky or calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
