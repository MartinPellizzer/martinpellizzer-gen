    "intro": "Ctenitis subconnexa var. subconnexa, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or in forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
