    "intro": "Calopogon oklahomensis f. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered grass pink, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive, showy white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant prefers moist, acidic wetlands and is often found in swamps and bogs. Its flowers are typically arranged in a loose cluster and have a unique, spurred structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
