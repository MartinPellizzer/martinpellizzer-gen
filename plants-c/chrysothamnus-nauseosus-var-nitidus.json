    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nauseosus var. nitidus, commonly known as the silverleaf goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spherical clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
