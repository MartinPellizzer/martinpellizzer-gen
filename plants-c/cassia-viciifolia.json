    "intro": "Cassia viciifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf cassia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnately compound, with serrated margins. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, followed by long, bean-like pods that contain flat, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Cassia viciifolia is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and vibrant floral display."
