    "intro": "Connarus odoratus, commonly known as the fragrant connarus, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage. The leaves are typically elliptical and have a glossy surface, while the flowers are small and white, often clustered in inflorescences. The plant produces berries that contain a single seed, and it is valued for its essential oils used in perfumery. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some areas."
