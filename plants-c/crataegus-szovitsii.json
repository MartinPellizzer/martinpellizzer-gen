    "intro": "Crataegus szovitsii, commonly known as the Szovits hawthorn, is a species of shrub native to Hungary and parts of Austria. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces red berries that are edible but typically used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
