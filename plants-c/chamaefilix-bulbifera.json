    "intro": "Chamaefilix bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbous rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage of silvery-gray leaves. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Chamaefilix bulbifera is also noted for its ability to form bulbous structures at the base, which help it survive in harsh environmental conditions."
