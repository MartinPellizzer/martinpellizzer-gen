    "intro": "Caladenia longicauda subsp. minima, commonly known as the dwarf spider orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open forests and grasslands. The plant features a single, slender stem that bears a single, elongated floral spike with a single, delicate orchid flower. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a spider, hence its common name. This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
