    "intro": "Chamaesyce cumbrae, commonly known as the Cumbrian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that bear small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
