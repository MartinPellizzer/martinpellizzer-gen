    "intro": "Corybas saprophyticus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique saprophytic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on decaying organic matter for nutrients. It is native to the moist, shaded environments of tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. The plant produces striking, often fluorescent flowers that are typically small and resemble fungi, a characteristic adaptation to its mycorrhizal relationships. Its flowers are usually greenish or pale in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its specialized habitat and ecological dependencies, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
