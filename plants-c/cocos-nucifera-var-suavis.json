    "intro": "Cocos nucifera var. suavis, commonly known as the sweet coconut or sweet variety of coconut, is a cultivar of the coconut palm native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its large, hairy, yellowish fruits that mature into sweet, aromatic coconuts. The plant produces a tall, slender trunk with pinnate leaves and is well-adapted to coastal and warm climates. Its fruits are highly valued for their sweet water and rich flesh, used in both culinary and commercial applications. This variety is often cultivated for its superior flavor and aroma compared to other coconut types."
