    "intro": "Calathea sellowii, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, patterned leaves that change color in response to light, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage displays intricate veining and coloration, often featuring shades of green, silver, and pink. Calathea sellowii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and air-purifying properties."
