    "intro": "Celtis trichocarpa, commonly known as the fragrant box elder, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It belongs to the family Ulmaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged fruits that disperse by wind. It is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, and it has moderate drought tolerance once established. Celtis trichocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
