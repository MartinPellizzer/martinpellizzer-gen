    "intro": "Cyperus senegalensis, commonly known as the Senegal flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, cylindrical flower clusters. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. It has rhizomatous growth and can form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Cyperus senegalensis is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of thatching in some regions."
