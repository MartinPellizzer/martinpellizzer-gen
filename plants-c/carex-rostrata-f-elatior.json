    "intro": "Carex rostrata f. elatior, commonly known as the tall spikerush, is a variant of the spikerush species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshes, swamps, or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive reddish hue at the base. This form is prized in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
