    "intro": "Cyphomandra ulei, commonly known as the yellow passionfruit vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to South America. It produces small, yellow, fleshy fruits that are typically harvested when fully mature. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces fragrant, five-petaled flowers. Its fruit is often used in culinary applications, though it is less commonly consumed than other passionfruit varieties. The botanical characteristics of Cyphomandra ulei make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ornamental gardening."
