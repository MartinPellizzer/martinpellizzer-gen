    "intro": "Cousinia pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered cudweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in dry, harsh environments. Its leaves are usually hairy and grayish-green, helping to reduce water loss. Cousinia pauciflora produces small, pale yellow to brown flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer."
