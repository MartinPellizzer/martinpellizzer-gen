    "intro": "Carex rariflora var. androgyna, commonly known as the rare-flowered androgynous sedge, is a unique variant of the Carex genus characterized by its androgynous flowers, which contain both male and female reproductive structures. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands, where it thrives in well-drained to moderately wet soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both staminate and pistillate flowers, facilitating self-pollination. Its foliage is grass-like, with narrow, grass-green leaves that are often clustered at the base. This plant is of interest to botanists due to its morphological and reproductive characteristics."
