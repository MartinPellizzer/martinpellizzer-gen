    "intro": "Cyperus digitatus var. obtusifructus, commonly known as the broad-fruited flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to wetland and marshy environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It has slender, grass-like stems that grow close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss in moist habitats. The fruit is a small, three-angled nutlet, which is characteristic of the Cyperaceae family."
