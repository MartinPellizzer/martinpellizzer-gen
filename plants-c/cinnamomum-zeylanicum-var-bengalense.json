    "intro": "Cinnamomum zeylanicum var. bengalense, commonly known as Indian cinnamon or Ceylon cinnamon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Sri Lanka and parts of southern India. It is characterized by its aromatic bark, which is harvested for its essential oils and medicinal properties. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by oval, dark blue berries containing winged seeds. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a distinct aromatic scent when crushed. This variety is closely related to the more widely known Cinnamomum zeylanicum, but it is often considered a subspecies with slightly different botanical features."
