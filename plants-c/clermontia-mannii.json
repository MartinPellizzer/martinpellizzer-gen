    "intro": "Clermontia mannii, commonly known as the Kona mountain ginger, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its striking red-orange bracts that surround its small white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments on the slopes of Hawaii's volcanoes. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Clermontia mannii is considered a rare and endangered species."
