    "intro": "Chamaefistula falcinella, commonly known as the Mediterranean boxwood, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is often used as a topiary or hedge plant."
