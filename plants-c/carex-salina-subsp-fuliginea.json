    "intro": "Carex salina subsp. fuliginea, commonly known as salt marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This subspecies thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, demonstrating tolerance to high salt concentrations. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in tidal areas. The plant plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing shorelines."
