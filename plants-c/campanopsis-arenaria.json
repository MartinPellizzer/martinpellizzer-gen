    "intro": "Campanopsis arenaria, commonly known as the sand bellflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, helping to reduce water loss. Campanopsis arenaria is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, dunes, and rocky areas."
