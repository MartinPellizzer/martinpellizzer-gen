It features small, hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or violet flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
