    "intro": "Cionosicys, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has no leaves, relying solely on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered."
