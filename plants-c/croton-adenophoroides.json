    "intro": "Croton adenophoroides, commonly known as the woolly croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific care to flourish."
