    "intro": "Columnea hirta, commonly known as the hairy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to red. The plant attaches itself to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host while also performing photosynthesis. It is often found in forest understories, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Columnea hirta is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique flowering habit."
