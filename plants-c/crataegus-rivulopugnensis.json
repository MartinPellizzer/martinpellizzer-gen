    "intro": "Crataegus rivulopugnensis, commonly known as the riverbank hawthorn, is a rare and specialized shrub native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, white flowers and red or orange berries that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, often rocky soils near streams and riverbanks, making it an important part of riparian ecosystems. Its leaves are typically oval with serrated edges, and it produces thorny branches typical of the Crataegus genus. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many areas, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
