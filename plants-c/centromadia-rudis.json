    "intro": "Centromadia rudis, commonly known as the coastal centromadia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Centromadia rudis is often found in dune ecosystems and is relatively rare, making it a unique component of coastal flora."
