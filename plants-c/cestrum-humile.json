    "intro": "Cestrum humile, commonly known as the night blooming jasmine, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats. Cestrum humile is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
