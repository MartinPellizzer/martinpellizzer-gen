    "intro": "Conophytum cordatum, commonly known as the heart-shaped stone plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. Its compact growth habit makes it an attractive addition to rock gardens and containers. It requires minimal water and full sun to thrive."
