    "intro": "Cinchona lambertiana, commonly known as Lambert's quinine tree, is a species of the Rubiaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 15 meters in height, featuring elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries containing numerous seeds. It is closely related to other cinchona species known for their medicinal properties, particularly the production of quinine. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
