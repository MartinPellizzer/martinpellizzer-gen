    "intro": "Cardamine cupanii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water crowfoot, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia, this species thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant is often found in nutrient-rich soils and is an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
