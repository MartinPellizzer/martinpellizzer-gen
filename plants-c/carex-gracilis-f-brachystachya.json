    "intro": "Carex gracilis f. brachystachya, commonly known as the short-stalked sedge, is a variant of the slender sedge native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically less than 5 cm in length, distinguishing it from the typical form. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream edges. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
