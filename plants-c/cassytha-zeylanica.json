    "intro": "Cassytha zeylanica, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a herbaceous vine characterized by its slender, twining stems that can spread along the ground or climb other plants. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often heart-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Cassytha zeylanica is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks."
