    "intro": "Chorizanthe pungens var. nivea, commonly known as white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry conditions with minimal care."
