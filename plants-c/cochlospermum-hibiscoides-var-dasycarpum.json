    "intro": "Cochlospermum hibiscoides var. dasycarpum, commonly known as the hairy-fruited cockspur, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces capsule fruits that are covered in dense, hairy protrusions, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
