    "intro": "Cyperus panormitanus, commonly known as the Mediterranean flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes, lake margins, and damp soils, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and its inflorescence consists of dense clusters of small, three-lobed flowers. Cyperus panormitanus is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
