These plants are characterized by their bright yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in dense, spiky clusters. Chrysopia species are native to various regions in Europe, Asia, and North America. They thrive in sunny environments and are often found in meadows, woodlands, and along roadsides. The genus includes several species, such as Chrysopia tinctoria, which has been historically used for its dye-producing properties."
