    "intro": "Cylindropuntia acanthocarpa subsp. coloradensis, commonly known as the Colorado prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in spines and are often green in color. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system for water storage. This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
