It is characterized by its striking red lip, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of pink and white. Cyrtochilum cocciferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
