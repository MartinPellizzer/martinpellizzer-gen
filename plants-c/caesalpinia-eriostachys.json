    "intro": "Caesalpinia eriostachys, commonly known as the flame tree or fire tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, feather-like, red or orange inflorescences that resemble flames, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. The plant has bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets, and its flowers are typically clustered in racemes. The seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sunlight."
