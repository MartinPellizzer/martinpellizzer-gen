It features showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its root system consists of fibrous roots that help anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil. Coulteria mollis is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade."
