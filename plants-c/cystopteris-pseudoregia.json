    "intro": "Cystopteris pseudoregia, commonly known as the New Zealand shield fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. The botanical features of Cystopteris pseudoregia make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora."
