    "intro": "Ctenitis setulosa, commonly known as the hairy bladder fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. Ctenitis setulosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
