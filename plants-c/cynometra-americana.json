    "intro": "Cynometra americana, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elongated, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, though it is often used in traditional crafts and as a source of timber. The plant also has medicinal uses in some African cultures, where various parts of the tree are employed in herbal remedies."
