    "intro": "Cynometra densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hard, heavy wood and dense foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its durable timber and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
