    "intro": "Cusparia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf cusparia, is a unique species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, which can range from lanceolate to ovate depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, a common feature among members of its family. Due to its adaptability and distinct appearance, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes in drought-tolerant gardens."
