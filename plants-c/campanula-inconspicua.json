    "intro": "Campanula inconspicua, commonly known as the inconspicuous bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or violet. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Campanula inconspicua is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
