    "intro": "Carex xerophila, commonly known as the desert sedge, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its resilience, it is often used in xeriscaping and habitat restoration projects."
