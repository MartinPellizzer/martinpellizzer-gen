    "intro": "Cerastium arcticum, commonly known as Arctic mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its tiny, clustered white flowers and hairy, succulent leaves. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its compact growth form helps it retain heat and avoid damage from strong winds. Cerastium arcticum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and provides forage for certain herbivorous insects."
