    "intro": "Cistanche eremodoxa, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for its nutrients, typically attaching itself to species of the genus Haloxylon. The plant produces yellowish-orange flowers and has a highly branched, thread-like structure. It is native to arid regions of Central Asia, including parts of China, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia. Due to its unique adaptations to harsh environments, it is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
