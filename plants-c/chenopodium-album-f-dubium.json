    "intro": "Chenopodium album f. dubium, commonly known as slender lambsquarters, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and alternate, ovate leaves that are usually hairy. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clustered inflorescences, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. This variety is similar to the common lambsquarters but differs in its more elongated growth habit."
