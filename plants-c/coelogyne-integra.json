    "intro": "Coelogyne integra, commonly known as the Orchid of the Forest, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters on long, pendulous stems. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Coelogyne integra is a popular choice for both indoor cultivation and botanical gardens due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
