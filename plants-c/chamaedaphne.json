    "intro": "Chamaedaphne, commonly known as leatherleaf, is a genus of evergreen shrubs belonging to the heath family (Ericaceae). It is native to the northern regions of North America and parts of Asia, typically found in wetland and coastal environments. The plant is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Chamaedaphne thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in sphagnum moss-dominated habitats. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a significant component of northern wetland ecosystems."
