    "intro": "Celtis crassifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to parts of the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ulmaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are thick and leathery. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spherical, berry-like fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with shallow fissures that become more pronounced as the tree matures. Celtis crassifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland areas."
