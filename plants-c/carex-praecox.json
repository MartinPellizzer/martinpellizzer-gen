    "intro": "Carex praecox, commonly known as early sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with triangular stems and dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, typically flowering in early spring before the leaves fully develop. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Carex praecox plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
