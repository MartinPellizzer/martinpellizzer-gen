    "intro": "Caladenia remota, commonly known as the remote spider-orchid, is an endemic orchid species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spider-like flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant has a single leaf and produces flowers in shades of pale yellow to cream, often with dark markings. Caladenia remota thrives in sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as coastal dunes and shrublands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
