    "intro": "Carex rosea var. texensis, commonly known as the Texas sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features grass-like leaves that are usually bluish-green in color, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early to mid-summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
