    "intro": "Comolia stenodon var. major, commonly known as the giant comolia, is a rare and distinctive plant species characterized by its large, elongated leaves and unique floral structure. Native to specific regions in South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. The plant exhibits a striking variation in leaf size and shape, with the \"major\" variety being notable for its significantly larger dimensions compared to other variants. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, displaying a range of colors from pale yellow to deep orange. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native habitat."
