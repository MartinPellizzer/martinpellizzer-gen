    "intro": "Catha emarginata, commonly known as khat, is a flowering plant native to the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its shrub-like structure, with elongated leaves that have serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into woody capsules containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, preferring well-drained soils. Its botanical significance is largely due to the stimulant properties of the alkaloids found in its leaves."
