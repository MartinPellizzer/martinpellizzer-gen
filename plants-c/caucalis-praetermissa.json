    "intro": "Caucalis praetermissa, commonly known as the lesser bladderwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating stems and small, bladder-like structures used for trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, often in nutrient-rich environments. Its flowers are usually pale blue or white, with five petals and a distinctive spurred structure. Caucalis praetermissa is a carnivorous plant that plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling algae and small invertebrate populations."
