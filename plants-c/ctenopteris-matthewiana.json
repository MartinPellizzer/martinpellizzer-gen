    "intro": "Ctenopteris matthewiana, commonly known as the Matthew's sea palm, is a rare and unique fern native to the tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant thrives in coastal environments, where it is adapted to tolerate salt spray and sandy soils. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ctenopteris matthewiana is considered a vulnerable species."
