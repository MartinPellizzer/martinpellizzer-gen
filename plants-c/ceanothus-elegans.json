    "intro": "Ceanothus elegans, commonly known as the silverleaf ceanothus, is a deciduous shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves that provide a striking visual contrast. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale blue flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Ceanothus elegans is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
