It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has slender, branched stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments."
