    "intro": "Cerastites macrocephalus var. maritimus, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand coastal salt spray and strong winds. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Due to its ecological importance, it is often found in maritime shrubland and coastal grassland ecosystems."
