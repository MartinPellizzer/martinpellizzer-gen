    "intro": "Clematis pubescens, commonly known as the downy clematis, is a perennial vine native to the eastern United States. It features slender, climbing stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, typically with three to five leaflets, and are also hairy. Clematis pubescens thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil."
