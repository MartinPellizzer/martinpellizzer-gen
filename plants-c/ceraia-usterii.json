It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Ceraia usterii is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks.
