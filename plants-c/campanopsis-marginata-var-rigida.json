It is characterized by its bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The rigid variety is distinguished by its more upright growth habit compared to other forms of Campanopsis marginata."
