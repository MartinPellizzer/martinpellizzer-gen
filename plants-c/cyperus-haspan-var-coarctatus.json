    "intro": "Cyperus haspan var. coarctatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in saturated soil conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. The flowers are small and clustered, with three stamens and a single pistil, typical of the Cyperaceae family."
