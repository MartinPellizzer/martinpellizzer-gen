It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by ellipsoidal, dry fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of desert flora."
