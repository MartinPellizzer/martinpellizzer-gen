    "intro": "Crinum nervosum, commonly known as the narrow-veined crinum, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features tall, erect stems that bear large, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy texture. Its bulbous structure allows it to store water and nutrients, aiding survival in dry conditions. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its dramatic floral display."
