    "intro": "Coffea vaughanii var. defuncta, commonly known as the extinct coffee plant, is a rare and now extinct variant of the Coffea vaughanii species. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and red flowers, which are typical of the Rubiaceae family. The plant was native to the highland regions of Ethiopia, where it thrived in cool, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it became extinct in the early 20th century. Its legacy remains in botanical records and historical studies of coffee diversity."
