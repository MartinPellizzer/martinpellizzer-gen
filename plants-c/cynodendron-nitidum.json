It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lanceolate, glossy green leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and disturbed areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
