    "intro": "Cactus aulacanthus, commonly known as the desert rose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of bright pink or red flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a succulent structure, allowing it to store water and survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. The flowers are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their striking appearance."
