    "intro": "Calamagrostis alpina var. extrema, commonly known as the Alpine sweetgrass, is a perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, silver-green foliage that turns coppery in the fall. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens with dry, sunny conditions. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of pale green to golden flowers in late summer."
