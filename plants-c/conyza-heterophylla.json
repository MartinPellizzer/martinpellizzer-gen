It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, which can range from basal rosettes to alternate leaves depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers with white ray florets, typically blooming in the summer months. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including fields and roadsides. Its adaptability makes it a common weed in agricultural and urban settings."
