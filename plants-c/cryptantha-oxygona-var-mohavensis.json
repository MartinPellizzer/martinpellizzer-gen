It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It produces small, cylindrical fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to desert conditions."
