    "intro": "Caulinia rubicunda, commonly known as the red-flowered clover, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, bright red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. Caulinia rubicunda has a deep root system that helps it thrive in poor soil conditions. It also plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil for other plants."
