    "intro": "Colymbada glehnii, commonly known as the Glehn's bladderwort, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves and specialized structures called bladders, which are used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. It is a carnivorous plant, relying on its bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
