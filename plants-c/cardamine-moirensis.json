    "intro": "Cardamine moirensis, commonly known as the moirensis water-cress, is a small perennial herb native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant features delicate, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in shallow water. Its small white or yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by round, hairy seed pods. Cardamine moirensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens."
