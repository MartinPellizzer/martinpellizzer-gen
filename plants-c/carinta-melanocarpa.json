    "intro": "Carinta melanocarpa, commonly known as the black-flowered carinta, is a rare and striking member of the Campanulaceae family. It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which contrast sharply with its green, lance-shaped leaves. Native to the mountainous regions of Central America, this plant thrives in cool, humid environments. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
