    "intro": "Crocus hybernus var. pyrenaeus, commonly known as the Pyrenean crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Pyrenean Mountains. It produces striking violet-blue flowers with a yellow center, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high altitudes. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to cold climates and its role in the local flora of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France."
