    "intro": "Cycas rumphii var. bifida, commonly known as the Bifid Cycas, is a cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base of the plant and female cones emerging from the upper stem. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is cultivated as a decorative plant in botanical gardens and private collections."
