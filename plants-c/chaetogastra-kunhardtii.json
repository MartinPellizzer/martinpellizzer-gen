    "intro": "Chaetogastra kunhardtii, commonly known as the Kunhardt's hairroot, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, cylindrical roots and its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
