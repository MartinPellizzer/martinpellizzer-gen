    "intro": "Couratari fagifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian walnut or fagifolia sycamore, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lecythidaceae. It is native to the rainforests of South America, particularly Brazil, Peru, and Colombia. The plant is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and produces an aggregate fruit composed of several woody follicles. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in folk medicine for their potential therapeutic properties. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat."
