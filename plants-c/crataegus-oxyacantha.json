It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the autumn, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus oxyacantha is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential cardiovascular benefits."
