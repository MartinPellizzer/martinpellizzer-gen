It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a vibrant touch to its compact form. The plant has slender, woody stems and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
