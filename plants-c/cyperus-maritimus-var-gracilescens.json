    "intro": "Cyperus maritimus var. gracilescens, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal and wetland areas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. The plant thrives in saline or brackish environments, making it a common sight in estuaries and tidal flats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and filter polluted water."
