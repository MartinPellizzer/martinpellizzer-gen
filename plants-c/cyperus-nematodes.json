    "intro": "Cyperus nematodes, commonly known as spike rush nematodes, are microscopic roundworms that parasitize various plants, including Cyperus species. These nematodes primarily affect the roots of their host plants, causing stunted growth and reduced vigor. They are commonly found in wetland and marshy environments where Cyperus plants thrive. The life cycle of these nematodes involves several stages, including egg, larval, and adult forms. Infestations can lead to significant damage in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
