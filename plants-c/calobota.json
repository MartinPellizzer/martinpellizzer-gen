    "intro": "Calobota, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by oval, woody fruits containing seeds. Calobota is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields due to its adaptability. It is considered an invasive species in some areas, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
