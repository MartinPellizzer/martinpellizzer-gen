    "intro": "Carya ovalis var. complanata, commonly known as the flat-leaf hickory, is a variant of the shagbark hickory. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that distinguish it from the typical shagbark hickory. The plant is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its fruit is a spiny, edible nut that matures in the fall. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in local ecosystems."
