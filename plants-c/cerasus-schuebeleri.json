    "intro": "Cerasus schuebeleri, commonly known as the Schuebeleri cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red, tart cherries that ripen in late summer. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its compact growth habit and seasonal interest. Cerasus schuebeleri is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun exposure."
