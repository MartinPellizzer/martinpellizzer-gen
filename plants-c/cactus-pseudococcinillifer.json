    "intro": "Cactus pseudococcinillifer, commonly known as the woolly cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering that helps reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling shrub with thick, fleshy stems that store water. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in clusters during the warmer months. Despite its appearance, it is not a true cactus but belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds."
