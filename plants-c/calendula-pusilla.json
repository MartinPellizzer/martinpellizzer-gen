    "intro": "Calendula pusilla, commonly known as dwarf sunflower, is a small, annual herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features delicate, daisy-like yellow to orange flowers with a central disk, and its leaves are hairy and serrated. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, making it a compact and ornamental species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Calendula pusilla is also valued for its medicinal properties, as it contains compounds with potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects."
