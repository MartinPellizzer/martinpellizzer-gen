    "intro": "Capsella draboides, commonly known as common mouse-ear or mouse-ear chickweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb with a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits called silicles. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and gardens. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural areas."
