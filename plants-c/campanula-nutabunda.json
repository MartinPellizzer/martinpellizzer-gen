    "intro": "Campanula nutabunda, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Campanula nutabunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine conditions."
