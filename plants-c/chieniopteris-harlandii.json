    "intro": "Chieniopteris harlandii, commonly known as the Harland's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
