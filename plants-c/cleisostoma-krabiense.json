    "intro": "Cleisostoma krabiense, commonly known as the Krabi ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered species of orchid native to Thailand. It is characterized by its unique, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with a short, horizontal rhizome and a single, erect stem. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a waxy texture and a dark green color. Cleisostoma krabiense thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests."
