    "intro": "Colea lantziana, commonly known as the Lantz's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands, often in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Colea lantziana is considered endangered and is protected in many states."
