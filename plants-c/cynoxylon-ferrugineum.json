    "intro": "Cynoxylon ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty wood fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its dark brown, rusty-colored rachises and fertile fronds that are typically shorter than the sterile ones. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Cynoxylon ferrugineum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
