It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The tree produces showy, bell-shaped, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its fruit is a long, cylindrical pod that splits open to release its seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
