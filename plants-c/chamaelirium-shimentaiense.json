    "intro": "Chamaelirium shimentaiense, commonly known as the Shimentai larkspur, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in East Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many showy and often toxic species. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically palmately divided, with a delicate, fern-like appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
