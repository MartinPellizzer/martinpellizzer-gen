    "intro": "Calochortus rhodothecus, commonly known as the redleaf globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking red or pinkish leaves and showy, globular flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its foliage and flowers are often used in native plant gardens for their ornamental value. Calochortus rhodothecus is also an important species for pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies."
