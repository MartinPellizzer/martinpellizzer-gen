    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 pseudohudsonii, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid between Carex hudsonii and Carex alpina, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically forms dense clumps of grass-like leaves, with narrow, linear blades that are often slightly hairy. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets arranged in a terminal cluster, typical of the sedge family. Carex \u00d7 pseudohudsonii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or wet meadows."
