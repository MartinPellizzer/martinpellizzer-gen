    "intro": "Cyclosorus lithophyllus, commonly known as the rock liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchaliaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and is typically found growing on rocky surfaces in moist, shaded environments. This species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor substrates, often colonizing limestone and other calcareous rocks. Its morphology includes a dorsiventral thallus with distinct leaf-like structures arranged in a spiral pattern. Cyclosorus lithophyllus plays a role in stabilizing rocky habitats and is an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
