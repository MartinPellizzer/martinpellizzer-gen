    "intro": "Ctenitis equestris, commonly known as the horse's tail fern, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is characterized by its long, creeping rhizomes that produce clusters of small, spore-bearing fronds. The fronds are typically narrow and linear, with a distinctive, feathery appearance. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and ability to spread vegetatively make it a notable species in both horticulture and ecological studies."
