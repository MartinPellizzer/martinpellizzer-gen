    "intro": "Cereus alatus, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height. The plant produces white, night-blooming flowers that are typically short-lived but striking. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems for survival in arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
