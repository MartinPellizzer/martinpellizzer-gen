    "intro": "Chaerophyllum humile, commonly known as small cow parsley, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and often covered in a fine white down. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and a delicate addition to gardens."
