    "intro": "Cenolophon oxymitrum, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange inflorescence, which resembles a flame, giving it its common name. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to efficiently capture moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Cenolophon oxymitrum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of rare orchids."
