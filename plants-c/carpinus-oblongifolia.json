    "intro": "Carpinus oblongifolia, commonly known as the Japanese hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and its smooth, gray bark that develops shallow fissures with age. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a hardy ornamental tree. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
