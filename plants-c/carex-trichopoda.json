    "intro": "Carex trichopoda, commonly known as the hairy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with triangular stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats, such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually hairy, giving it its common name, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex trichopoda plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
