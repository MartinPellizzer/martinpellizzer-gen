    "intro": "Cyclosorus edanyoi, commonly known as the Edanyo's water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant has four leaflets arranged in a cross shape, which is a distinctive feature of the genus Cyclosorus. It thrives in freshwater habitats with soft, muddy substrates and requires moderate to low light conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of aquatic ecosystem health."
