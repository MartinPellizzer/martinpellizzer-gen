It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with prominent veins, which give it its scientific name \"nervosa.\" It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
