    "intro": "Cyrtochilum palmatum, commonly known as the palmate orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers with a distinctive palmate (fan-shaped) appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are usually broad and strap-like, and the flowers are often white or pale pink with intricate patterns. Cyrtochilum palmatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
