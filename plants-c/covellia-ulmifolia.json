    "intro": "Covellia ulmifolia, commonly known as the elm-leaf cowwheat, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often hairy leaves that resemble those of an elm. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. Covellia ulmifolia is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is a component of the understory vegetation in temperate forests."
