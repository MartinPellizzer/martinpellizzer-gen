    "intro": "Cupressus cashmeriana subsp. himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude areas, reaching heights of up to 20 meters with a conical or columnar shape. The plant features scale-like leaves that are dark green and densely packed, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
