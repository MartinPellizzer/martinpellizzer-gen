    "intro": "Cleome alliacea, commonly known as garlic mustard, is an herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several small, rounded seeds. Cleome alliacea is often found in woodland edges and moist habitats, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
