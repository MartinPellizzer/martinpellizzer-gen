    "intro": "Copisma tenue, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes or along the edges of ponds. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, contributing to the ecological health of its wetland environment. Copisma tenue is often overlooked due to its subtle appearance but plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity."
