    "intro": "Cordia chamissoniana var. complicata, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for various birds and small mammals. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
