    "intro": "Carduncellus reboudianus, commonly known as the Persian artichoke, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces spiny, globe-shaped buds that are typically harvested before they fully open. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. The plant is valued both for its ornamental appeal and for its edible flower buds, which resemble artichokes in appearance and texture."
