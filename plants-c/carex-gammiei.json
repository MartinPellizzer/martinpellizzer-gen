    "intro": "Carex gammiei, commonly known as the Pacific coast sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and disturbed areas. Carex gammiei has a rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It plays an important role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
