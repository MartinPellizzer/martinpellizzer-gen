    "intro": "Cissus obovata, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a climbing plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in small, white, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often used in ornamental gardening. Cissus obovata is also known for its ability to climb using adventitious roots that form along its stems."
