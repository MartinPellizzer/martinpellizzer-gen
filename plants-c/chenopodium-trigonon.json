It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are encased in a hard, triangular capsule. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Chenopodium trigonon is known for its adaptability and can be both a weed and a forage plant for livestock."
