    "intro": "Codonorhiza micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered codonorhiza, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Codoniaceae. It is characterized by its compact stature and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a smooth surface and a fibrous root system adapted for nutrient absorption. Native to specific regions in Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and biodiversity."
