    "intro": "Chasmatophyllum maninum, commonly known as the Manin's chasmatophyllum, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its distinctive floral structure. The plant produces large, showy flowers with a specialized corolla that resembles a trumpet, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat destruction and climate change."
