    "intro": "Cyperus owanii var. rogersii, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide, with a bluish-green coloration. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often submerged or floating in shallow water. It thrives in moist to aquatic conditions and is often found in the southeastern United States. This variety is distinguished by its narrow foliage and is used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
