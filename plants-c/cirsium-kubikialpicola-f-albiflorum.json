    "intro": "Cirsium kubikialpicola f. albiflorum, commonly known as the alpine thistle, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, showy flower heads. The subspecies albiflorum is distinguished by its white or pale yellow flowers, which contrast with the dark green foliage. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it faces harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
