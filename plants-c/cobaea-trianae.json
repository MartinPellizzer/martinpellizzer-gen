    "intro": "Cobaea trianae, commonly known as the sweet pea vine, is a climbing plant native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor to supports as it climbs. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Cobaea trianae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its delicate, sweet scent."
