    "intro": "Chamaebuxus venenosa subvar. obovata, commonly known as the poison ivy, is a toxic shrub native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its alternate, trifoliate leaves that are typically oval or obovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It contains urushiol, a potent allergen that causes skin irritation in many people. Due to its toxicity, it is often considered a weed in forested areas."
