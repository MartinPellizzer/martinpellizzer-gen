    "intro": "Cleistocactus fieldianus subsp. samnensis, commonly known as the Samnensian Cactus, is a rare and specialized cactus native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that open only at night, a feature typical of many nocturnal flowering plants. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the extreme temperatures of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
