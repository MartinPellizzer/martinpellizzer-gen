    "intro": "Chironia uliginosa, commonly known as the bog gentian, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs and marshes. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces a single flower per stem. Chironia uliginosa plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators in its wetland environment."
