    "intro": "Carex fragilis, commonly known as the brittle sedge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. This species is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowering spikes that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. Its delicate, wind-pollinated flowers contribute to its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
