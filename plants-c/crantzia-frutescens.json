    "intro": "Crantzia frutescens, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous stems and leaves are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. Crantzia frutescens is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline."
