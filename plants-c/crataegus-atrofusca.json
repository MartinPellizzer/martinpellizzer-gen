    "intro": "Crataegus atrofusca, commonly known as the blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by the characteristic black fruits. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Crataegus atrofusca is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
