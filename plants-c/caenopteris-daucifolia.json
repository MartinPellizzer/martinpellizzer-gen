    "intro": "Caenopteris daucifolia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silvery, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing in dunes or on rocky shores. Caenopteris daucifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal ecosystems."
