    "intro": "Convolvulus hederaceus, commonly known as creeping wood sorrel, is a flowering plant belonging to the bindweed family (Convolvulaceae). It is a herbaceous perennial that produces small, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers with five petals. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a trailing growth habit and can spread rapidly, often forming dense mats. Its botanical features make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in cultivated areas."
