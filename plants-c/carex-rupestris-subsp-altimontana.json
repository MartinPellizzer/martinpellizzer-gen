    "intro": "Carex rupestris subsp. altimontana, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Its flowering spikes are usually short and clustered, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
