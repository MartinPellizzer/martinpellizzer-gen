    "intro": "Cyathostemon verrucosus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual with slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellow or greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters called cyathia, a characteristic feature of the genus. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Cyathostemon verrucosus is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats."
