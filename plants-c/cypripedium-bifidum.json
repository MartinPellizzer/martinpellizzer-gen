    "intro": "Cypripedium bifidum, commonly known as the bifid lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that feature a distinctive, pouch-like lip with a deep, red or orange coloration. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, upright stem that bears the ornate floral structure. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
