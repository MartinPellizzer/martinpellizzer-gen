    "intro": "Calamagrostis pilosula, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and panicles of small, silver-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as wet meadows and riparian areas. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense stands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and restoration projects."
