    "intro": "Cerastium fontanum subsp. schurii, commonly known as Schur's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Alps and adjacent regions of Central Europe. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous prostrate stems that root at the nodes, creating dense ground cover. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered with fine, silky hairs, giving them a distinctive soft texture. It thrives in moist, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and woodland edges."
