    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris var. coronopifolia, commonly known as the crownleaf weed, is a variant of the common chickweed. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, sprawling stems and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a distinctive, slightly lobed appearance. This plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it easily identifiable, though it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
