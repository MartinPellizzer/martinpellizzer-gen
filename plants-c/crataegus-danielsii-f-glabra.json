    "intro": "Crataegus danielsii f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth thornapple, is a rare hawthorn species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for ecological studies and conservation efforts."
