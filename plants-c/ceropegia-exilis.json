    "intro": "Ceropegia exilis, commonly known as the string of hearts, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale green, which are adapted for pollination by specific insects. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Ceropegia exilis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
