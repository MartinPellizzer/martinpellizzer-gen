    "intro": "Cyclosorus irayensis, commonly known as the Madagascar water fern, is a unique aquatic plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are often divided into four lobes. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is known for its ability to form dense mats on the water surface. Its reproductive structures are submerged, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Cyclosorus irayensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality maintenance."
