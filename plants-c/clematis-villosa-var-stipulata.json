    "intro": "Clematis villosa var. stipulata, commonly known as the stipulate clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with stipules, which are small, leaf-like structures at the base of the leaf stalks. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
