    "intro": "Calligonum polygonoides, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. Calligonum polygonoides is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience."
