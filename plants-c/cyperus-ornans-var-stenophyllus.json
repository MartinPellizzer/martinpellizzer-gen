    "intro": "Cyperus ornans var. stenophyllus, commonly known as narrow-leaf sedgeland, is a variant of the Cyperus ornans species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, thriving in well-drained to waterlogged soils. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, three-lobed flowers, which are often pale green to reddish in color. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
