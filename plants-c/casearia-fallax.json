    "intro": "Casearia fallax, commonly known as the white flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine white or silver hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, spherical fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. Casearia fallax is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
