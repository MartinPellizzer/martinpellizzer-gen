    "intro": "Crepidium lamii, commonly known as the broad-leafed twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has a slender, leafless stem and produces small, greenish-white flowers. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Crepidium lamii is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and is often found in temperate regions of Europe and Asia."
