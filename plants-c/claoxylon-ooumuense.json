    "intro": "Claoxylon ooumuense, commonly known as the Oumuense sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and compound leaves with a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its timber is valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional crafts and medicinal applications. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
