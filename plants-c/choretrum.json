    "intro": "Choretrum, commonly known as the \"buttercup grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers. Choretrum species typically grow in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. They have slender, grass-like leaves and produce small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants."
