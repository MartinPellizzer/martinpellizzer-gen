    "intro": "Cissus subtetragona, commonly known as the four-angled cissus, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive four-angled stems and heart-shaped leaves that are usually dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, grape-like berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and ease of care. Cissus subtetragona is also valued for its ability to climb and cover trellises or walls effectively."
