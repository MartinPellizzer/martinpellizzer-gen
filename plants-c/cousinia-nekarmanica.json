    "intro": "Cousinia nekarmanica, commonly known as the Nekarmanica cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flower heads that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Cousinia nekarmanica is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in environments with low precipitation."
