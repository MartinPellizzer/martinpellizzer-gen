    "intro": "Carlowrightia lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf cypress, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of California. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown hue. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, moist climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
