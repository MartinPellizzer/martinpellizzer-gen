    "intro": "Cortiella, commonly known as the common bird's nest fungus, is a species of basidiomycete fungus that belongs to the family Physalacriaceae. It is characterized by its unique, cup-shaped fruiting body that resembles a bird's nest, often filled with tiny, gelatinous spore sacs. The fungus typically grows on dead wood, particularly in temperate regions, and is often found in forested areas. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and the structure of the fruiting body provides protection for the spores until they are released. Cortiella is an important decomposer in forest ecosystems, contributing to the breakdown of organic matter."
