    "intro": "Corbularia serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, contributing to the ecological health of wetland environments. Corbularia serotina is valued for its role in aquatic ecosystems and its aesthetic appeal in water gardens."
