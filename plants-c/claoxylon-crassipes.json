    "intro": "Claoxylon crassipes, commonly known as the thick-stemmed claoxylon, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, woody stem and large, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its latex is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Claoxylon crassipes is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its durable wood."
