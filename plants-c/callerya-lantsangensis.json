    "intro": "Callerya lantsangensis, commonly known as the Lantsang orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to China and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually long and narrow, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Callerya lantsangensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
