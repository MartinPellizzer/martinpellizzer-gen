It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. It is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and erosion control."
