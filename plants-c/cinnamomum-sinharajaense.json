    "intro": "Cinnamomum sinharajaense, commonly known as Sinharaja cinnamon, is a rare and endemic species native to the Sinharaja Forest in Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces dark brown, rough-textured berries that contain elliptical seeds. It thrives in the humid, shaded understory of primary rainforests, often growing at elevations between 600 and 1,200 meters. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
