    "intro": "Cupressus lawsoniana var. pendula-vera, commonly known as the weeping Lawson cypress, is a variant of the Lawson cypress native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its cascading, weeping foliage that creates a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant has scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, and it produces small, spherical cones. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is often used in landscaping for its unique visual appeal and relatively slow growth rate."
