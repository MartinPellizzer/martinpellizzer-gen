    "intro": "Cycas circinalis subsp. papuana, commonly known as the Papuan cycas, is a rare cycad species native to the island of New Guinea. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones spherical, typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
