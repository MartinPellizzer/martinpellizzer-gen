    "intro": "Crocus reticulatus var. rectilimbus, commonly known as the straight-spurred crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, violet-blue flowers with distinctive, straight spurs that set it apart from other crocus varieties. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, making it one of the earliest flowering crocuses. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a dense rosette near the ground. The flowers are often pollinated by bees and other early spring pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance in alpine environments."
