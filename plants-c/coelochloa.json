    "intro": "Coelochloa, commonly known as the mountain grass or hill grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It consists of several species that are typically found in temperate and subtropical regions, often growing in mountainous or rocky habitats. The plants are characterized by their slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. Coelochloa species usually have narrow, grass-like leaves with parallel veins, and they produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. These plants are often used in landscaping for their hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
