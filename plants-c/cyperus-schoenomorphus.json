    "intro": "Cyperus schoenomorphus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Cyperus schoenomorphus produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the base of the plant. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
