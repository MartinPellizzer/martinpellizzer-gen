    "intro": "Cardamine killipii, commonly known as Killip's water shield, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy flowers and often toxic compounds. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, with leaves that are submerged or floating. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in early spring, and the plant is often found in association with other aquatic vegetation. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
