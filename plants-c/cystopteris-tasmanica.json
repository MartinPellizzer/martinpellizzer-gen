    "intro": "Cystopteris tasmanica, commonly known as the Tasman fern, is a species of shield fern native to Tasmania and southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Cystopteris tasmanica plays an important role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various organisms."
