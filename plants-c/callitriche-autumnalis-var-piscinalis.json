    "intro": "Callitriche autumnalis var. piscinalis, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds, ditches, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has small, star-shaped leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and appear in clusters, often floating on the water surface. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
