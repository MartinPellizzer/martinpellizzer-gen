    "intro": "Cattleya ghillanyi, commonly known as the Guiana Cattleya, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often with a contrasting lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Cattleya ghillanyi is valued in horticulture for its beauty and is relatively easy to cultivate under proper conditions."
