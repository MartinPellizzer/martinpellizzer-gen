    "intro": "Cinchona colorata, commonly known as the pink quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental pink flowers and red fruits. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and have a distinctive reddish hue when mature. While not as well-known for its medicinal quinine content as other cinchona species, it is valued for its horticultural appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
