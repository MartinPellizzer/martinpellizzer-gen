    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe pachypus, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its massive, tree-like form. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant features a central trunk covered in fibrous, woody tissue, with large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Crocodeilanthe pachypus thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
