    "intro": "Callista secunda, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Callista secunda is often found in moist, shady environments such as forests or wetlands. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
