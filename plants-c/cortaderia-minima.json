    "intro": "Cortaderia minima, commonly known as the silver feather grass, is a compact, clump-forming perennial grass native to South America. It features slender, arching blades with silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, feathery plumes during the flowering season, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for ornamental gardens and landscapes."
