    "intro": "Carex hypolytrifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like leaves and cylindrical flower clusters. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in suitable habitats. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically wind-pollinated, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
