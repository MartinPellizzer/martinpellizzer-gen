    "intro": "Castilleja kaibabensis, commonly known as Kaibab paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red to orange tubular flowers. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
