    "intro": "Cola suboppositifolia, commonly known as the African cola tree, is a species of the Rubiaceae family native to tropical Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 15 meters in height, with a dense canopy and smooth, greyish bark. Its leaves are elliptical,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often arranged in pairs along the branches, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by berries containing stimulant-containing seeds. It is valued for its caffeine-rich seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of cola nut."
