    "intro": "Chondrocarpus clavatus, commonly known as the clubbed hook sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and stream banks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its slender, triangular stems are often clustered, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The species is characterized by its distinctive club-shaped base, which gives it its common name."
