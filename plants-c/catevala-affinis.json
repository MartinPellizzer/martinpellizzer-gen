It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to absorb nutrients efficiently from the soil.
