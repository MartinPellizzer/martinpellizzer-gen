    "intro": "Chirita depressa, commonly known as the creeping chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically white or pale purple, appearing in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and spreads through runners, making it a common ground cover in suitable habitats. Chirita depressa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its mild sedative properties."
