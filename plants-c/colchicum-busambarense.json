    "intro": "Colchicum busambarense, commonly known as the Busambare mountain crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Ethiopian Highlands. It features striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring, typically from June to July. The plant has a robust corm, which serves as its storage organ and allows it to survive in harsh mountainous conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from the base of the plant. Colchicum busambarense is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils."
