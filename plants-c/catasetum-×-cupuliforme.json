    "intro": "Catasetum \u00d7 cupuliforme, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, hood-like flower structure that encloses the reproductive organs, a unique adaptation for pollination by specific wasps. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually bright yellow or orange, with a distinct, elongated spur that aids in pollination. Catasetum \u00d7 cupuliforme is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation under the right conditions."
