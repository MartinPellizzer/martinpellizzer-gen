    "intro": "Convolvulus supinus, commonly known as the prostrate morning glory, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often opening in the morning. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while the seeds are enclosed in a spiral-shaped capsule. Convolvulus supinus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
