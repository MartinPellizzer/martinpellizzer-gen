    "intro": "Cornus walteri var. insignis, commonly known as the Walter's dogwood, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its clusters of white, bract-like flowers that appear in late spring. The plant has opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. Its fruit is a red drupe that contains a single seed, and it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Due to its limited range and habitat loss, it is of significant botanical interest and conservation concern."
