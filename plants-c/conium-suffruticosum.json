    "intro": "Conium suffruticosum, commonly known as poison hemlock, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It belongs to theApiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, particularly coniine, which can be lethal to humans and animals if ingested. It often grows in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in fields. Due to its toxicity, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
