    "intro": "Correia, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, spurred flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Correia is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in tropical ecosystems."
