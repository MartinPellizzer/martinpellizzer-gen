It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. The plants are characterized by their woody stems, alternate leaves, and showy, often pink or red, five-petaled flowers. Cudrania species are adapted to survive in harsh environments, with some possessing succulent leaves and deep root systems to conserve water. They play an important role in their ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various animals."
