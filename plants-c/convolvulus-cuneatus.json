    "intro": "Convolvulus cuneatus, commonly known as the slender morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with trailing stems that produce small, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces capsules that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The flowers typically bloom in the morning, hence its common name."
