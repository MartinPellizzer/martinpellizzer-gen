    "intro": "Calanthe gustavii, commonly known as the Gustav's calanthe, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern. Its inflorescence consists of a raceme of flowers, with each bloom having three sepals and three petals, one of which is often modified into a lip. Calanthe gustavii thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories where it benefits from dappled sunlight."
