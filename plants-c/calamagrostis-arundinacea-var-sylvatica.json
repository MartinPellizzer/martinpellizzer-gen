    "intro": "Calamagrostis arundinacea var. sylvatica, commonly known as the silky blue reed, is a tall, clump-forming grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, arching stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often tinged with silver. The plant produces panicles of fluffy, silver-blue flowers in late summer to early autumn, adding a striking visual element to gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and marshy areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
