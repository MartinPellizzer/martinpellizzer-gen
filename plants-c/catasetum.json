    "intro": "Catasetum, commonly known as the orchid with the unique pollen sacs, is a genus of orchids native to tropical regions of the Americas. These plants are characterized by their striking, often colorful flowers that feature a specialized structure called a \"pollinarium,\" which holds the pollen. The flowers typically have a lip that is modified into a spur, which serves as a nectar source for pollinators. Catasetum species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they require high humidity and bright, indirect light. They are popular among orchid enthusiasts due to their beauty and the complexity of their pollination mechanisms."
