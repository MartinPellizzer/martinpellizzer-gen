    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental weed cock's-comb, is a flowering plant native to regions of Asia, including parts of China and the Middle East. It is an annual herb characterized by its distinctive cup-shaped seed pod, which resembles a small pouch or wallet. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. It has heart-shaped leaves and small white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. This subspecies is closely related to the common shepherd's purse, but it is distinguished by its geographic distribution and slightly different morphology."
