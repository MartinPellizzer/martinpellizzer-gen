    "intro": "Centaurea vlachorum, commonly known as the Balkan knapweed, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces bright yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive purple central disk. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Centaurea vlachorum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun conditions."
