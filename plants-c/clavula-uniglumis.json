    "intro": "Clavula uniglumis, commonly known as the single-barred grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Clavula uniglumis is adapted to grow in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and savannas. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy."
