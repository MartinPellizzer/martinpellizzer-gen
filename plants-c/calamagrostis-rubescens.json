    "intro": "Calamagrostis rubescens, commonly known as the red panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, reddish-purple inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more reddish in the fall. Calamagrostis rubescens is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support wildlife."
