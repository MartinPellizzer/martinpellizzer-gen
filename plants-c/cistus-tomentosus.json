    "intro": "Cistus tomentosus, commonly known as woolly rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, woolly gray foliage and showy, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid environments. Its leaves are covered in a thick layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cistus tomentosus is often used in xeriscaping and has historical uses in herbal medicine."
