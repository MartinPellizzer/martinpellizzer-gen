    "intro": "Caoutchoua, commonly known as the \"false rubber tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and includes several species that are often cultivated for their ornamental value. The plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with opposite leaves and often produce fruits that are capsules containing numerous seeds. Caoutchoua species are sometimes used in horticulture for their vibrant blooms and adaptability to warm, humid climates."
