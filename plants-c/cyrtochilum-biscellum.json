    "intro": "Cyrtochilum biscellum, commonly known as the Biscellum orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often arranged in a raceme. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. Cyrtochilum biscellum prefers warm, humid environments and is often found in forest understories where it receives filtered sunlight."
