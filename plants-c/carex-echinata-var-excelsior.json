    "intro": "Carex echinata var. excelsior, commonly known as the tall spiny sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and spiky, triangular inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and stiff, with a rough texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
