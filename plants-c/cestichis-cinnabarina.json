    "intro": "Cestichis cinnabarina, commonly known as the red-stemmed cestichis, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in woodland areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and less commonly encountered species."
