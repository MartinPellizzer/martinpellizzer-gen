    "intro": "Crucianella pentandra, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in brackish or freshwater environments, often in coastal areas with fluctuating salinity. Its leaves are small and often submerged, while its flowers are borne in clusters at the water's surface. Crucianella pentandra plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
