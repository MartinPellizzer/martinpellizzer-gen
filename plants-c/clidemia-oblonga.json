    "intro": "Clidemia oblonga, commonly known as false mallow, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to oblong leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, often with a distinctive calyx. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Clidemia oblonga is also known for its ability to spread aggressively, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain areas."
