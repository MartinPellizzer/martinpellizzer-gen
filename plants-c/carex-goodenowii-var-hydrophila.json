It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to aquatic environments and is often found in marshes, pond margins, and along streams.
