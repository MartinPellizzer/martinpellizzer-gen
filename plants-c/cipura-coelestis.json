    "intro": "Cipura coelestis, commonly known as the skyflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, sky-blue flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Cipura coelestis is considered a valuable species in botanical research and conservation efforts."
