    "intro": "Cardia aphylla, commonly known as the leafless cardia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its absence of leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique morphology, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience."
