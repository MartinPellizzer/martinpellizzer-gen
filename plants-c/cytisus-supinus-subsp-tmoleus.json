    "intro": "Cytisus supinus subsp. tmoleus, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, trifoliate, and covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
