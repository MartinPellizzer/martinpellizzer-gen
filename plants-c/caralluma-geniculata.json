    "intro": "Caralluma geniculata, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Africa. It features a distinctive, branching stem with small, fleshy leaves that help it store water. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, which are often followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments due to its thick cuticle and ability to go dormant during droughts. Caralluma geniculata is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
