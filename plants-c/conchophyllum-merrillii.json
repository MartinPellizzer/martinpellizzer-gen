    "intro": "Conchophyllum merrillii, commonly known as the Malayan starfish sponge or Malayan starfish, is a unique marine invertebrate belonging to the family Hexactinellida. It is characterized by its intricate, sponge-like structure composed of silica-based spicules arranged in a complex, star-shaped pattern. This organism is typically found in shallow tropical waters, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, where it thrives in coral reefs and rocky substrates. Its delicate, translucent body is often adorned with a network of fine, branching filaments that aid in filter feeding. Conchophyllum merrillii plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for smaller organisms."
