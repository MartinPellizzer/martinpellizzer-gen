It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, hair-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and crevices, demonstrating a strong ability to thrive in harsh environments. Its flowering spikes are usually small and inconspicuous, bearing tiny grass-like flowers. Chaetogastra saxicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
