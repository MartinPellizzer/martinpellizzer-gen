It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically submerged or partially submerged in moist environments. The plant produces small, white flowers with four petals, which are often clustered in umbels. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in wetlands and streamside habitats. The plant is notable for its ability to tolerate both full sun and partial shade, making it adaptable to a range of aquatic and semi-aquatic conditions."
