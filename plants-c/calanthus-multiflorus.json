    "intro": "Calanthus multiflorus, commonly known as the many-flowered calanthus, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Calanthus multiflorus thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it is primarily grown for its ecological benefits rather than its showy appearance."
