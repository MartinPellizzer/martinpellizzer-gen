    "intro": "Cebatha miqueliana, commonly known as the Miquel's cebatha, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
