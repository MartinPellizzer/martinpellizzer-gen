    "intro": "Carex breviculmis subsp. fibrillosa, commonly known as the fibrous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its fibrous, hairy texture distinguishes it from other sedges and contributes to its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
