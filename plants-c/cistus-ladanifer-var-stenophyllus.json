    "intro": "Cistus ladanifer var. stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a fragrant resin known as labdanum, which has been historically used in perfumery and traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or coastal environments. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
