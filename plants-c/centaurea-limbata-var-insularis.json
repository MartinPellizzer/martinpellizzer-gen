    "intro": "Centaurea limbata var. insularis, commonly known as the Canary Island star-thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Canary Islands. It features spiny, branching stems and produces purple to pinkish flowers with distinctive ray florets. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions outside its native range."
