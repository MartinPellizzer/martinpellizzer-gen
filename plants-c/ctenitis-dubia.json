    "intro": "Ctenitis dubia, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its spores are produced in small, clustered clusters on the underside of its fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Ctenitis dubia is considered an endangered species in its native range."
