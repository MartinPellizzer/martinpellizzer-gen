It is a low-growing, evergreen shrub that typically reaches a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves and produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
