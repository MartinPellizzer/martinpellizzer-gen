It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy, blue-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. Cousinia leptomera is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is an important component of its local ecosystem."
