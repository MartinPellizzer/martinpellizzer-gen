It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its dense, thorny branches. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in winter, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a soft, velvety texture with a distinct, waxy coating. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry that contains several seeds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
