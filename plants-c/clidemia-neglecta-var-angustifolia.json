    "intro": "Clidemia neglecta var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf clidemia, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a nuisance in certain ecosystems."
