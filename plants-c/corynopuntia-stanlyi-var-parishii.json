    "intro": "Corynopuntia stanlyi var. parishii, commonly known as the Paraguay apple cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Paraguay and Brazil. It is a low-growing, sprawling cactus with cylindrical stems that are typically ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, apple-like fruits that are edible for both humans and animals. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique fruit."
