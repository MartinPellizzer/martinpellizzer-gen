    "intro": "Corydalis pallida, commonly known as the pale corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from pale pink to white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Corydalis pallida is valued in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
