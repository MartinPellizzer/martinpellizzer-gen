    "intro": "Canavalia maritima, commonly known as the sea bean, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a legume that thrives in sandy soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant has compound leaves and produces small, green pods that contain edible seeds. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes through its extensive root system. Canavalia maritima is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil in its habitat."
