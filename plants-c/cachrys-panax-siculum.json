    "intro": "Cachrys panax-siculum, commonly known as the Sicilian ginseng, is a rare and lesser-known botanical species native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately compound leaves and small, white flowers. The plant is known for its medicinal properties, with roots containing bioactive compounds similar to those found in Panax ginseng. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
