    "intro": "Cuscuta australis subsp. breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. The plant is native to Australia and thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and shrublands. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
