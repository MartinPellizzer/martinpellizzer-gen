It is native to China, specifically the Yunnan and Guizhou provinces, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are elliptical and have a glossy surface. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
