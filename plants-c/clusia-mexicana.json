    "intro": "Clusia mexicana, commonly known as Mexican glory bush, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a smooth texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to various soil types and resistance to drought make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Clusia mexicana is also valued for its ability to thrive in coastal areas due to its tolerance of salt spray."
