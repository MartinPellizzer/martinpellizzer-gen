    "intro": "Coffea ciliolata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed coffee plant, is a species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture on the underside. Its flowers are white and clustered in panicles, followed by red, fleshy berries containing the seeds used for coffee production. This variety is less commonly cultivated than other coffee species but is valued for its unique flavor profile."
