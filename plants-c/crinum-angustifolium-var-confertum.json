The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear showy, white or pale pink flowers with a strong fragrance. Its bulbs are clustered and often used for propagation, while its roots are adapted to thrive in moist, swampy soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland habitats."
