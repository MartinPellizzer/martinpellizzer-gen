    "intro": "Catabrosa antarctica, commonly known as Antarctic hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Antarctica and southern South America. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in harsh, arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in extreme conditions. Catabrosa antarctica plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its extreme habitat."
