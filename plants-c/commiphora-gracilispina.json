    "intro": "Commiphora gracilispina, commonly known as the slender-spined myrrh, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, spiny stems and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces a fragrant resin, similar to myrrh, which is exuded from its bark and can be harvested for medicinal or aromatic purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its unique appearance and resinous properties, it is of interest to botanists and traditional medicine practitioners alike."
