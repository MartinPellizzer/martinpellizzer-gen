    "intro": "Clonodia racemosa var. mattogrossensis, commonly known as the Brazilian clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets that are hairy on the underside. This variant is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories."
