    "intro": "Corymbia dampieri, commonly known as the Red Hill bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that often displays a reddish hue, and its small, elliptical leaves that are usually clustered at the base of the branches. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, spherical capsules containing numerous seeds. It is a hardy species that thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in association with other rainforest flora."
