    "intro": "Carex arenaria subsp. ligerica, commonly known as the sand sedge, is a low-growing, perennial grass-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense coating of fine hairs. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
