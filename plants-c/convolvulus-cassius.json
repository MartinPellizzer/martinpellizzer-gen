    "intro": "Convolvulus cassius, commonly known as the scarlet bindweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
