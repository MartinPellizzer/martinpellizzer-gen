    "intro": "Cakile maritima subsp. maritima, commonly known as sea rocket, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lobed, succulent leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates with high salinity. Its leaves and flowers are edible, and it plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes. The subspecies is notable for its ability to tolerate salt spray and harsh coastal conditions."
