    "intro": "Carex mertensis, commonly known as Mert's sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, cylindrical inflorescences. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Carex mertensis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
