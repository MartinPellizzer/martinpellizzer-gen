    "intro": "Crassula decidua, commonly known as the frost plant or rock rose, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping in arid regions."
