    "intro": "Chenolea eurotioides, commonly known as the European false truffle, is a rare and elusive fungus that belongs to the family Eurotioideae. It is typically found in temperate regions, growing in association with certain tree species such as oaks and beeches. The fruiting bodies of Chenolea eurotioides are small, irregularly shaped, and often resemble truffles in appearance, though they are not edible. This fungus is characterized by its dense, fibrous texture and a distinct, earthy aroma. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is of particular interest to mycologists and conservationists."
