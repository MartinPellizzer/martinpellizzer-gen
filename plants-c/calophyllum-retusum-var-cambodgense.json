    "intro": "Calophyllum retusum var. cambodgense, commonly known as Cambodian flame tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a medium-sized tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, with a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptic in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. Its most striking feature is its bright orange to red flowers, which appear in clusters and bloom during the dry season. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
