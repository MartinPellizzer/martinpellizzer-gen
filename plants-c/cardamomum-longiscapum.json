It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant leaves and striking, showy inflorescences. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spike-like structures. Its rhizomes, similar to those of ginger, are often harvested for their medicinal and culinary uses. Cardamomum longiscapum is valued not only for its fragrance but also for its potential health benefits."
