    "intro": "Cirsium angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, prairies, and rocky areas. It has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads."
