    "intro": "Combretodendron, commonly known as the flame tree, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. These plants are characterized by their showy, often red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a striking visual display. The leaves are typically alternate and simple, with some species having serrated edges. Combretodendron species are often deciduous, shedding their leaves during dry seasons, and they play a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds. The genus is part of the family Combretaceae, which includes other ornamental and economically important plants."
