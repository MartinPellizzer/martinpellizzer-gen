    "intro": "Cistus umbellatus subvar. villosissimus, commonly known as the woolly rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features silvery-gray, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers in the spring, which are borne on short, hairy stems. Its aromatic leaves and flowers are often used in traditional herbal remedies. This subvariety is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant."
