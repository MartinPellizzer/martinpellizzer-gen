    "intro": "Carex pseudofrigida, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. It has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white bloom, enhancing its frosty appearance. Carex pseudofrigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
