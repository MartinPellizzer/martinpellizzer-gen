    "intro": "Ceratostylis tetrarioides, commonly known as the four-leafed marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often in the understory of tropical rainforests. The plant features a slender, leafless stem that bears a single, showy greenish-white flower with a distinctive, spurred lip. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the damp environment. The orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
