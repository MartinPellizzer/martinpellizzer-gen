    "intro": "Clidemia aguilarii, commonly known as the Guadaloupean mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Clidemia aguilarii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar to pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its native regions."
