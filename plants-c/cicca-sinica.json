    "intro": "Cicca sinica, commonly known as the Chinese cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to southern China. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones for reproduction. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk with a smooth, grayish bark and large, pinnate leaves that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
