    "intro": "Cordia coriacea, commonly known as the rough cordia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and has rough, bark-like stems covered in thick, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow, followed by orange or red berries. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Cordia coriacea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
