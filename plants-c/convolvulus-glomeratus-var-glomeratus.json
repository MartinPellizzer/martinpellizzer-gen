    "intro": "Convolvulus glomeratus var. glomeratus, commonly known as the clustered bindweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in groups of three to five. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed areas. Due to its invasive potential, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural settings."
