    "intro": "Castilleja moranensis var. cinerascens, commonly known as the grayleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vivid orange to red bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on host plants for water and nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands, often in association with other plant species. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
