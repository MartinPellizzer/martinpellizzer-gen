    "intro": "Cistus polifolius, commonly known as the many-leaved rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. Cistus polifolius is also known for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used in traditional herbal remedies."
