It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with photosynthesis occurring primarily through its floral bracts. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and moderate humidity. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts."
