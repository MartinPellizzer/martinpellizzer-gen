    "intro": "Centropogon urceolatus, commonly known as the water plantain, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in a spike, which are pollinated by insects. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in marshy areas, making it ecologically significant. Centropogon urceolatus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
