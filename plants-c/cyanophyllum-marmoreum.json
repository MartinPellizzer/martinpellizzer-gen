    "intro": "Cyanophyllum marmoreum, commonly known as the marble cypress, is a species of coniferous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, smooth, bluish-gray bark that resembles marble, giving it its common name. The plant has scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, forming a dense, conical shape. It produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. Cyanophyllum marmoreum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, acidic environments such as swamps and pine forests."
