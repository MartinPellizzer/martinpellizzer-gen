    "intro": "Cerastium alpinum subsp. aquaticum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions. It features small, succulent leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and windy conditions. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Its compact growth form and ability to tolerate harsh environments make it a characteristic species of high-altitude ecosystems."
