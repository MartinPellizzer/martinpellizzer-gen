    "intro": "Crabbea migiurtina, commonly known as the Desert Bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, featuring slender, branching stems. The plant produces clusters of tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Crabbea migiurtina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
