    "intro": "Caragana crassicaulis, commonly known as the thick-stemmed shrub or sand sagebrush, is a hardy shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, woody growth and small, compound leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Caragana crassicaulis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for wildlife."
