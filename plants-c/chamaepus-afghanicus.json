    "intro": "Chamaepus afghanicus, commonly known as Afghan bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Afghanistan. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Chamaepus afghanicus is often found in alpine meadows and is relatively resilient to drought and cold temperatures."
