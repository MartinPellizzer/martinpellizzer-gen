    "intro": "Coleus parvicalyx, commonly known as the small-leaved coleus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features vibrant, showy bracts that come in a variety of colors, including red, orange, and yellow, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive greenish-white underside. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Coleus parvicalyx is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
