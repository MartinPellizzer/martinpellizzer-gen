    "intro": "Collinsonia sinensis, commonly known as Chinese collinsonia, is a perennial herb native to China. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
