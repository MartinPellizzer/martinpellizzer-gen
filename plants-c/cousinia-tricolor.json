    "intro": "Cousinia tricolor, commonly known as the three-color cushion flower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and its striking tricolored flowers, which typically display shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, also known as the daisy or sunflower family, and is known for its ability to thrive in arid and rocky environments. Its foliage consists of dense, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to harsh climates. Cousinia tricolor is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
