It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a compact inflorescence during the spring and early summer. Its stems are erect and covered with fine, prickly hairs, contributing to its common name. Clypeola echinata is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a characteristic species of dry, sunny habitats."
