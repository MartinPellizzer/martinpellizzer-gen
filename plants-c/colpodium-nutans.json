    "intro": "Colpodium nutans, commonly known as the nodding colpodium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikelets. Its flowers are often described as nodding due to the way the inflorescence droops. Colpodium nutans typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
