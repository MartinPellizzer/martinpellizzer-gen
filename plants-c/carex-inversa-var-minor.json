    "intro": "Carex inversa var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf inverted sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water, contributing to its aquatic appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many sedges. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other water-saturated habitats. Its botanical structure supports its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
