    "intro": "Colliguaja triquetra, commonly known as the three-cornered nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are typically oval with a slightly hairy texture. It produces small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally not cultivated for food but is sometimes studied for its chemical composition."
