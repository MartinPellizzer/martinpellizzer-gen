It is an annual herb that grows up to 1 meter tall, characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions."
