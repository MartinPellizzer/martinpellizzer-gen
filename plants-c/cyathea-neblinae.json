    "intro": "Cyathea neblinae, commonly known as the misty tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-drained soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Cyathea neblinae plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity."
