    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha var. azarolus, commonly known as the Persian hawthorn, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia. It features dense, thorny branches and small, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative hedge. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and historical use in traditional medicine."
