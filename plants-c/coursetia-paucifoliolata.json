    "intro": "Coursetia paucifoliolata, commonly known as the sparse-leaved coursetia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, rocky soils. It is adapted to full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity."
