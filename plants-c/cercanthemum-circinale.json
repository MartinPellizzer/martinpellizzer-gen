It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
