    "intro": "Catasetum longiantennatum, commonly known as the long-whisked orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated sepals and petals that often display vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces a unique structure called a \"catasetum,\" which is a specialized pollination mechanism involving a pollinium that adheres to the insect's body. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Its botanical features make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts and horticulturists."
