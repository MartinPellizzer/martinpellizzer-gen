It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous minute seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
