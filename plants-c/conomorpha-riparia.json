    "intro": "Conomorpha riparia, commonly known as the riverbank morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and riverbanks of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found along the edges of streams and ponds. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an invasive species in some regions. Conomorpha riparia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
