It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate, serrated leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its flowers are small, white, and arranged in a dense, terminal cluster, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
