    "intro": "Ctenitis meridionalis, commonly known as the southern holly fern, is a species of fern native to southern regions of the United States. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it establish a dense root system, which aids in nutrient absorption. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round interest in gardens and natural habitats."
