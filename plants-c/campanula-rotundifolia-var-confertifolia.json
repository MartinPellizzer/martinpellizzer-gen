    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia var. confertifolia, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The leaves are rounded and slightly hairy, often appearing in a basal rosette. This variety is characterized by its dense flowering clusters, which distinguish it from other campanula species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and stream banks."
