It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are followed by three-sided, spike-like fruits. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
