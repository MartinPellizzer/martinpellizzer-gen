    "intro": "Calamagrostis arctica, commonly known as Arctic grass or northern feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, silver-gray foliage that reflects the harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold climates with minimal snow cover. Calamagrostis arctica plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
