    "intro": "Carex hirticaulis, commonly known as hairy spike-rush, is a perennial sedge native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant features cylindrical, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a single, slender spike that bears small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex hirticaulis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
