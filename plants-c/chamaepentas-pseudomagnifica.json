    "intro": "Chamaepentas pseudomagnifica, commonly known as the giant Himalayan maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Nepal and northern India. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter, providing a striking visual display during the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, hairy fruits that persist into winter. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects."
