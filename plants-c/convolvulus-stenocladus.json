    "intro": "Convolvulus stenocladus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a herbaceous annual with slender, twining stems that climb by means of tendrils. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in the morning. Its leaves are narrow and alternate, often with a slightly hairy surface. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals."
