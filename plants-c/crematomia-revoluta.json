It is characterized by its distinctive, curling leaves that give it a striking appearance. The plant belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is known for its delicate, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of purple and pink. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for horticulturists and botanists due to its limited distribution and ornamental value. However, it is also considered endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection."
