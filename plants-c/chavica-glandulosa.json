    "intro": "Chavica glandulosa, commonly known as the Kashmiri saffron or Indian saffron, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring. Its most notable feature is the stigmas of its flowers, which are harvested and used as a spice, similar to true saffron. Due to its aromatic properties and medicinal uses, it holds cultural and economic significance in traditional medicine and cuisine."
