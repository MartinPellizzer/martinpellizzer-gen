    "intro": "Cotoneaster verruculosus, commonly known as the rough cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, oval leaves with a rough, waxy texture, and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in the spring. The plant bears red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and seasonal interest. Cotoneaster verruculosus is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils."
