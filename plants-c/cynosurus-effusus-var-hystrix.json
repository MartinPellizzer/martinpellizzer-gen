    "intro": "Cynosurus effusus var. hystrix, commonly known as the hairy hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and woodland edges. Its inflorescence consists of a narrow, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect life."
