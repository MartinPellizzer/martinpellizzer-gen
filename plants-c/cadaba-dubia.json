    "intro": "Cadaba dubia, commonly known as the desert rose or African violet, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom throughout the warmer months. Its adaptability to drought and well-drained soil makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Cadaba dubia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
