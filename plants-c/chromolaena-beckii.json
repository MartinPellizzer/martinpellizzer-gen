    "intro": "Chromolaena beckii, commonly known as the tropical weed or false chaff tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, with rough, often hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsules that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it an invasive species in some areas. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and challenging to manage in agricultural settings."
