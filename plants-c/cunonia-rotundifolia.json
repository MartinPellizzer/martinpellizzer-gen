    "intro": "Cunonia rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf cunonia, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its rounded, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by round, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
