    "intro": "Centaurea romana, commonly known as the Roman cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking purple or red flowers, which are typically arranged in dense, spherical clusters. The plant has spiny, bract-like leaves and produces small, elongated seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and wastelands. Centaurea romana is also known for its medicinal properties, with historical use in treating skin conditions and as a diuretic."
