    "intro": "Coccoloba bejuco, commonly known as Spanish bayonet, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, often spiny leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually alternate and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Coccoloba bejuco is often found in coastal areas and can thrive in sandy or rocky soils."
