    "intro": "Cyrtocarpa quinquestila, commonly known as the five-winged mulga, is a small, shrub-like plant native to arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, winged fruits that split open when mature. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically small, oval, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Cyrtocarpa quinquestila is well-suited to dry, sandy soils and is often found in spinifex plains and saltbush woodlands."
