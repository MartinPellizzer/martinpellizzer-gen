    "intro": "Cynosurus dactylon, commonly known as the tufted hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form compact clumps. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and typically have a slight reddish or purple hue at the base. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This plant is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along the edges of wetlands, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
