It is characterized by its dense, branched growth habit and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture, and its leaves are typically gray-green with a velvety appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
