    "intro": "Capsella tenerescens, commonly known as the slender weed or slender peppergrass, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features slender, branching stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy leaves that are often lobed or toothed, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in fields. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
