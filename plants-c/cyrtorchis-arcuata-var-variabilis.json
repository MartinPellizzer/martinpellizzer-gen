It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and distinctive, zigzag-shaped flower spikes. The flowers are typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a faintly colored lip that distinguishes it from other similar species. This orchid thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its blooming period occurs from late spring to early summer, adding a unique ornamental value to its natural habitat."
