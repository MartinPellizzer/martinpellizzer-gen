    "intro": "Cassytha casuarinae, commonly known as the coastal dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using its yellow, thread-like stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and heathlands. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
