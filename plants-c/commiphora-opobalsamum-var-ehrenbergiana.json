    "intro": "Commiphora opobalsamum var. ehrenbergiana, commonly known as the African frankincense tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of East Africa. It produces a resinous sap that is harvested for its aromatic gum, which has been used traditionally for medicinal and incense purposes. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with the plant relying on wind for pollination."
