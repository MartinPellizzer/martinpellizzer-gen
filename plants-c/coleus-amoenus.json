    "intro": "Coleus amoenus, commonly known as the garden spider plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of Africa. It features striking, colorful leaves that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with contrasting green veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by capsule fruits containing tiny seeds. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage rather than its blooms. Coleus amoenus prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers."
