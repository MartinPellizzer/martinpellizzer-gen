    "intro": "Cocos pynaertii, commonly known as the Pynaert's coconut, is a rare and enigmatic species belonging to the Arecaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to three meters in length. Its inflorescences are typically borne at the base of the trunk, and the fruits are fibrous, similar to other coconut species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cocos pynaertii is considered a critically endangered plant."
