    "intro": "Cupressus ericoides, commonly known as the Ericoid Cypress, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like foliage that forms a compact, conical shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green cones, which are typically borne on the upper branches. Its leaves are dark green and remain on the tree for several years, contributing to its evergreen nature. This species is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
