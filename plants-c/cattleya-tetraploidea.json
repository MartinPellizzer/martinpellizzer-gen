    "intro": "Cattleya tetraploidea, commonly known as the purple-veined cattleya, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a vibrant purple or pink coloration with contrasting veining. The plant is a terrestrial orchid, meaning it grows in soil rather than on trees, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often reaching several inches in length. Cattleya tetraploidea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
