    "intro": "Cenchrus squamulatus, commonly known as the silky grass or sand couch, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant in livestock farming."
