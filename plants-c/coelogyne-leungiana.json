    "intro": "Coelogyne leungiana, commonly known as the Leung's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China and northern Vietnam. It features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces a single, showy inflorescence with several fragrant, pale yellow to orange flowers. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, typically arranged in two rows along the pseudobulb. Coelogyne leungiana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
