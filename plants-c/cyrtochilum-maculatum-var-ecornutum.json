    "intro": "Cyrtochilum maculatum var. ecornutum, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink, often with a distinctive spotted or mottled pattern on the petals. The plant grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rock faces or in forest understories, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
