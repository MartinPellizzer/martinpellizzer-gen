    "intro": "Caragana frutescens var. intermedia, commonly known as the Siberian peashrub, is a deciduous shrub native to Central Asia and parts of Siberia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically 5 to 11 pairs of leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by pea-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates, making it a hardy ornamental and potential windbreak species. Its botanical features make it useful in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
