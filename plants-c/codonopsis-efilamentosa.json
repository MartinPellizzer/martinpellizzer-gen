    "intro": "Codonopsis efilamentosa, commonly known as the threadleaf bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and thread-like, giving it its common name, while its flowers bloom in late summer. Codonopsis efilamentosa is valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
