    "intro": "Cordia guaranitica, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or *Cordia guianensis*, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and oval-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in moist forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic and practical properties."
