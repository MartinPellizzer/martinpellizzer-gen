    "intro": "Chondrilla gummifera, commonly known as the gum plant, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a sticky, resinous gum that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are typically small, narrow, and arranged alternately along the stems. Chondrilla gummifera is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils."
