    "intro": "Chamaesyce hypericifolia, commonly known as the coastal goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically thrives in sandy or disturbed soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its salty, windy environment. Chamaesyce hypericifolia is well adapted to coastal conditions and is often used in restoration projects to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
