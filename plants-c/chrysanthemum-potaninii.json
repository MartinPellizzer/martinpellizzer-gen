    "intro": "Chrysanthemum potaninii, commonly known as the Tibetan chrysanthemum, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of Tibet and adjacent regions. It features upright, branched stems and is characterized by its densely packed, small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Chrysanthemum potaninii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
