    "intro": "Calamagrostis purpurea var. vivipara, commonly known as purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and panicles of purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in wet or semi-wet conditions."
