    "intro": "Chamaesyce ocellata subsp. arenicola, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, hairy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its succulent stems and leaves help it store water, making it well-suited for sandy or gravelly soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects in its native range."
