    "intro": "Cryptostylis walkerae, commonly known as the Walkera's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking terrestrial orchid native to the subtropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its pale green, fleshy leaves and a single, slender flower that resembles a ghostly face, hence its common name. The plant produces a unique, fragrant flower with a white and greenish hue, often with a yellowish throat. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found growing on the forest floor or on the bases of trees. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species."
