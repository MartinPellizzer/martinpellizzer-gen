    "intro": "Commiphora capensis, commonly known as the Cape myrrh, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic resinous exudate, which has been used traditionally for medicinal and aromatic purposes. The plant features small, dark green leaves and produces yellowish flowers that are followed by small, woody fruits. Its resin, known as myrrh, is harvested from the bark and has a strong, balsamic scent. Commiphora capensis is well adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in fynbos vegetation."
