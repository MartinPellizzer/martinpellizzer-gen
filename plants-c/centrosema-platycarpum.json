    "intro": "Centrosema platycarpum, commonly known as the hairy bean or cowpea vine, is a tropical legume native to the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, round pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisines. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used as a forage crop for livestock. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in agricultural systems for soil enrichment."
