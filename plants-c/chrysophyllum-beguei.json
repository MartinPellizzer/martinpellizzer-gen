    "intro": "Chrysophyllum beguei, commonly known as the Beguei cherimoya, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the humid forests of Central Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by the development of its edible fruit. The fruit is similar to a cherimoya, with a creamy, sweet pulp that is highly valued in local cuisines. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruit, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a shade tree in tropical regions."
