    "intro": "Cremanthodium palmatum subsp. palmatum, commonly known as the palmate sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
