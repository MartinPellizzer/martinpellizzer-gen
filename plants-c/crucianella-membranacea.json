    "intro": "Crucianella membranacea, commonly known as the bladder nut, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal areas of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces round, bladder-like fruits that are filled with a sticky, aromatic resin. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in coastal landscaping for erosion control."
