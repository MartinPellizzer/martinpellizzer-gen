    "intro": "Coffea robusta, commonly known as Congolese coffee or African coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly the Congo basin, and is well adapted to humid, high-altitude environments. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain two seeds, which are the raw material for coffee beans. These beans are typically larger and have a stronger, more robust flavor compared to those of Coffea arabica. Coffea robusta is widely cultivated for its high yield and resilience to pests and diseases, making it a significant crop in global coffee production."
