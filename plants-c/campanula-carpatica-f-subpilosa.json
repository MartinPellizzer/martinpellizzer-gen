    "intro": "Campanula carpatica f. subpilosa, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a hybrid cultivar of the campanula genus. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value lies in both its foliage and its delicate, cascading floral display."
