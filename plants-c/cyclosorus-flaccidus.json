    "intro": "Cyclosorus flaccidus, commonly known as the flaccid water shield, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are typically rounded or oval in shape, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, which are followed by berry-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Cyclosorus flaccidus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
