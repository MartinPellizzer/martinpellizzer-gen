    "intro": "Cyathea glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a robust root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle. Cyathea glaberrima is often found in lowland rainforests and plays a role in maintaining soil stability and biodiversity in its habitat."
