It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems, small leaves, and clusters of white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically edible but not widely consumed by humans. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and conservation efforts due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations."
