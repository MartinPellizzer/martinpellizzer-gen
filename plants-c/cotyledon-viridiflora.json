    "intro": "Cotyledon viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green, with a waxy texture to store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Cotyledon viridiflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
