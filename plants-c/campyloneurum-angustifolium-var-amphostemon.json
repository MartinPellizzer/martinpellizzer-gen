    "intro": "Campyloneurum angustifolium var. amphostemon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved campyloneurum, is a rare moss species characterized by its slender, elongated leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The leaves are usually narrow and gradually tapering, with a distinct midrib that runs the length of the leaf. The plant produces small, club-shaped capsules that are often surrounded by a protective calyptra. This variety is noted for its delicate structure and is often found in specific microhabitats across temperate regions."
