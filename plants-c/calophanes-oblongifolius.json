It is characterized by its elongated, oblong leaves that are often glossy and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
