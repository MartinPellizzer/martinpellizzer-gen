    "intro": "Cynoctonum molle, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible but have a strong, spicy flavor. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and vibrant flowers. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
