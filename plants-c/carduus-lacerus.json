    "intro": "Carduus lacerus, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features a sturdy, upright stem covered in rough, bristly hairs, and its leaves are deeply lobed with a serrated edge. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind.
