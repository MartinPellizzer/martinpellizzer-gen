It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It has a compact growth habit with hairy leaves and produces fruit that is capsule-like in structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
