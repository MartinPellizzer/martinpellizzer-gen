    "intro": "Coleocephalocereus pachystele, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can reach heights of several meters. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. Its thick, ribbed stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The cactus is also notable for its slow growth rate and long lifespan, often living for several decades."
