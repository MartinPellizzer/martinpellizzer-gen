    "intro": "Centromadia parryi subsp. congdonii, commonly known as the Congdon's centromadia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and often emit a mild, spicy odor, while its flowers are small and white, arranged in complex clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
