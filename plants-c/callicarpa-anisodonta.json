    "intro": "Callicarpa anisodonta, commonly known as the red beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces striking clusters of bright red berries in the fall, which are a key feature for identification. These berries are edible for humans but can be toxic to livestock. Callicarpa anisodonta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited for moist, partially shaded environments."
