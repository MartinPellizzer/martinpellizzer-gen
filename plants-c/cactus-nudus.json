    "intro": "Cactus nudus, commonly known as the naked cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its lack of spines, which distinguishes it from many other cactus species. The plant has a cylindrical stem that is covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
