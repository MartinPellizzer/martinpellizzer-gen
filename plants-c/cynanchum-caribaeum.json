    "intro": "Cynanchum caribaeum, commonly known as the Caribbean milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stem and opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. Cynanchum caribaeum is often found in disturbed soils and coastal areas, thriving in humid tropical climates."
