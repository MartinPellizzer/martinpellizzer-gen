    "intro": "Chaetachme aristata var. kamerunensis, commonly known as the Cameroon slender grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas."
