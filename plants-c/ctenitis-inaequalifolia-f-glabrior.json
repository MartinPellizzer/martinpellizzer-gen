    "intro": "Ctenitis inaequalifolia f. glabrior, commonly known as the smooth-leafed tree fern, is a variant of the tree fern species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of fronds that are typically more robust and less hairy compared to the typical form. The fronds are bioluminescent, with a distinctive pattern of light and dark green that enhances its visual appeal. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in tropical and subtropical climates."
