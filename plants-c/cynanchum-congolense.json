    "intro": "Cynanchum congolense, commonly known as African milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds and related plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to many herbivores. Cynanchum congolense is often found in woodland and grassland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils."
