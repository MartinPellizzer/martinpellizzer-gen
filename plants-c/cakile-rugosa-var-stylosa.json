It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves that are often lobed or toothed. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its ability to colonize coastal environments."
