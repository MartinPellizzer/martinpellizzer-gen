It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with a distinctive silver-blue hue on the leaf surfaces. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wet meadows, and thrives in full to partial sunlight. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, three-ranked flowers. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
