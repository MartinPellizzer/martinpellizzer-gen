    "intro": "Celsia sorgerae, commonly known as the Sorger's celsia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a compact, shrub-like appearance. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, often covered in a fine, silvery down. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Celsia sorgerae is considered a vulnerable species."
