    "intro": "Cytisus collinus, commonly known as the Scotch broom, is a shrub native to western Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, woody stems and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Cytisus collinus is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which can improve soil fertility."
