It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually green with a reddish or purplish underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in swampy areas. Its ornamental value is sometimes appreciated in horticulture, though it is more commonly found in its natural habitat."
