It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The plant produces small, spiny capsules that contain one to three chestnut-like seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream valleys. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and native plant gardening."
