    "intro": "Ceropegia glabriflora, commonly known as the woolly ceropegia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent species characterized by its fleshy, tuberous stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, white, woolly coating. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to store water in its thick stems. Ceropegia glabriflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
