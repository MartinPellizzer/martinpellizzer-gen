    "intro": "Chaptalia latipes, commonly known as the narrowleaf chaptalia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, contributing to its ecological role in pollination."
