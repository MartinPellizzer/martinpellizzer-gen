It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks, preferring rich, loamy soils. The plant features delicate, palmately divided leaves that resemble oak leaves, hence its common name. Its flowers are bright yellow and consist of five petals arranged in a cup-like shape. It is often found in association with oak and other hardwood trees, contributing to the biodiversity of forest understories."
