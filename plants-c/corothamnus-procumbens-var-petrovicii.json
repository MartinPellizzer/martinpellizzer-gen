    "intro": "Corothamnus procumbens var. petrovicii, commonly known as the Petrovici's creeping thimbleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to specific regions of eastern Europe. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. The plant has hairy, branched stems that often lie flat on the ground, forming a mat-like growth habit. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is adapted to moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks."
