    "intro": "Cirsium semzinanicum, commonly known as the Semzina thistle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Carpathian Basin, primarily found in Hungary and parts of Serbia. The plant is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky or dry soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
