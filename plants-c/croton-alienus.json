    "intro": "Croton alienus, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical plant characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. It is native to regions of Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant foliage and showy blooms. The plant has palmate leaves with three to five lobes, and its bark is rough and fissured. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.
