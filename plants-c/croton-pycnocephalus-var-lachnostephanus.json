    "intro": "Croton pycnocephalus var. lachnostephanus, commonly known as the red-veined croton, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with prominent red veins that create a visually appealing contrast. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that transition from green to yellow as they mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its vibrant foliage, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
