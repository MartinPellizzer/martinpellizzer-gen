    "intro": "Cuphea dodecandra, commonly known as the flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its striking, tubular, red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Cuphea dodecandra is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower."
