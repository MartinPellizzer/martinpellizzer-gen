    "intro": "Cheilanthes bullata, commonly known as the bullate fern, is a species of rock fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky slopes and crevices. The plant is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients in harsh conditions. Cheilanthes bullata is well adapted to drought and can survive in low-nutrient soils."
