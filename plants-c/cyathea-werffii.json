It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments, often in shaded, moist forest areas. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its tall stature, while its fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions. Cyathea werffii plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various organisms."
