    "intro": "Cicuta grandifolia, commonly known as water hemlock, is a toxic member of the parsley family (Apiaceae) native to North America. It is a biennial herb that grows up to 2 meters tall, with smooth, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters, and its roots contain potent toxins, including cicutoxin. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, stream banks, and roadside ditches. Due to its high toxicity, it is considered one of the most dangerous plants in North America."
