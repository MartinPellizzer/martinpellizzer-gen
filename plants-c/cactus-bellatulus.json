    "intro": "Cactus bellatulus, commonly known as the Mexican cactus or the red cactus, is a species native to the deserts of Mexico. It is a spineless cactus that typically grows in clusters, forming a dense, rounded shape. The plant has bright red or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. The plant is adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
