It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
