    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 pseudohelvola, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Carex helvola and Carex praelata, characterized by its clumping growth habit and dense foliage. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet environments, making it a common sight in wetlands and along stream banks. Its ability to tolerate varying water levels makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
