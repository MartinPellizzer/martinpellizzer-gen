    "intro": "Campanula alaskana, commonly known as Alaska bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as tundra and alpine meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold climates. Campanula alaskana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
