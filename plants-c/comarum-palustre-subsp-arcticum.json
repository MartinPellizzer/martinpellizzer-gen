    "intro": "Comarum palustre subsp. arcticum, commonly known as the Arctic marsh cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in wet, boggy environments and has small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces five-petaled flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to cold climates and has a rhizomatous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
