    "intro": "Cousinia lasiophylla, commonly known as the woolly cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in the summer months. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Cousinia lasiophylla is often found in mountainous and semi-desert regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
