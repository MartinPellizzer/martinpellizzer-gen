    "intro": "Cassia swainsonii, commonly known as the silky cassia, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright yellow, fluffy flower clusters that bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its seeds are encased in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Cassia swainsonii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
