    "intro": "Cyperus leptocladus, commonly known as narrow-leaved flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense stands in wetlands and along water bodies. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spikelets, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. Cyperus leptocladus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms."
