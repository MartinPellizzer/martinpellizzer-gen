    "intro": "Carex geniculata, commonly known as the bent-stem sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as wet meadows, stream banks, and marshy areas. It produces small, clustered inflorescences of greenish flowers that mature into dark brown berries. Carex geniculata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
