    "intro": "Chusua roborowskyi var. unifoliata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chusua, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. It is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
