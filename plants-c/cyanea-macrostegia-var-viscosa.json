    "intro": "Cyanea macrostegia var. viscosa, commonly known as the sticky cyanea, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers with five petals, which are typically arranged in clusters. Its habitat is primarily in moist, shaded areas on forest floors, where it thrives in the unique microclimates of Hawaii. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
