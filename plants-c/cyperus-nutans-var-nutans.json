    "intro": "Cyperus nutans var. nutans, commonly known as the drooping flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically found in clusters at the base of the plant. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of wetland ecosystems."
