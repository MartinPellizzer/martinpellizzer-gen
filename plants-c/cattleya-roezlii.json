    "intro": "Cattleya roezlii, commonly known as the R\u00f6sel's Cattleya, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple, often with a contrasting lip. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and sword-shaped, and it prefers bright, indirect light with high humidity. Cattleya roezlii is a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
