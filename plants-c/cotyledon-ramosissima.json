    "intro": "Cotyledon ramosissima, commonly known as the frost plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and summer months. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in arid conditions make it a popular choice for rock gardens. Cotyledon ramosissima is also known for its ability to survive extreme temperatures and is relatively low maintenance."
