    "intro": "Cotoneaster hymalaicus, commonly known as the Himalayan cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1-3 meters and is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats at high elevations. Cotoneaster hymalaicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh climates."
