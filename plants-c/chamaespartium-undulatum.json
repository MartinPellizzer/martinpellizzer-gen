It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as grasslands and forest edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds.
