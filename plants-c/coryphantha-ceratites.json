    "intro": "Coryphantha ceratites, commonly known as the horned cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are often covered in white or yellow spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Coryphantha ceratites is a slow-growing plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil."
