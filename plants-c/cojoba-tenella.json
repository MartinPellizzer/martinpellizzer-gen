    "intro": "Cojoba tenella, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in coastal areas and is often found growing along shorelines and in sandy soils. Its ability to tolerate salt spray makes it well adapted to maritime environments. Cojoba tenella is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture."
