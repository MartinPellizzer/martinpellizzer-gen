    "intro": "Coelogyne simplex, commonly known as the simple coelogyne, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces elegant, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically blooms once a year, with flowers emerging from the base of the pseudobulbs. Its leaves are strap-like, arranged in a fan shape, and are often covered in a fine, silky texture. Coelogyne simplex is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
