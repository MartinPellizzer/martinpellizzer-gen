    "intro": "Cyrtandra dolichocalyx, commonly known as the long-stalked cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. Cyrtandra dolichocalyx is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
