It features dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has dark green, fleshy leaves that are often used in succulent arrangements. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
