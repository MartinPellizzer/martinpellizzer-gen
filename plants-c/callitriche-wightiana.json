    "intro": "Callitriche wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's water star, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces tiny, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue, and it has slender, branching stems with small, oval leaves. It is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in moist environments. Callitriche wightiana is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through vegetative reproduction."
