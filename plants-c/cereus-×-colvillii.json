    "intro": "Cereus \u00d7 colvillii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a hybrid cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, emitting a fragrant scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its succulent leaves are modified into spines, and it thrives in full sun with minimal water. Cereus \u00d7 colvillii is a popular choice for desert gardens due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
