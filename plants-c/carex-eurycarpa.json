    "intro": "Carex eurycarpa, commonly known as broadfruit sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to North America and typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes and swamps. The plant has grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its fruiting structures, called achenes, are enclosed in a three-lobed bract, which is a distinctive botanical feature. Carex eurycarpa plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms."
