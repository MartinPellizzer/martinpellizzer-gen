    "intro": "Carex goodenowii subsp. stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and pond edges. The plant features grass-like leaves that are generally narrow and grass-green in color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. The stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil in wetland environments."
