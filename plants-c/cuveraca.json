    "intro": "Cuveraca, commonly known as the sacred orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cuveraca is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations and cultural importance to indigenous communities."
