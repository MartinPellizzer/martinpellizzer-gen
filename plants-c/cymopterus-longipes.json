    "intro": "Cymopterus longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and showy yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cymopterus longipes thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and it is adapted to arid environments with limited water availability. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential medicinal research."
