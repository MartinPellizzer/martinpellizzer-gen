    "intro": "Campyloneurum jalapense, commonly known as the Jalape\u00f1o fern, is a species of polypodiaceae native to Mexico. It is a small, epiphytic fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions, a unique feature that aids in its ecological adaptation."
