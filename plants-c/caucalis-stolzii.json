    "intro": "Caucalis stolzii, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through features such as succulent leaves and deep root systems. Caucalis stolzii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
