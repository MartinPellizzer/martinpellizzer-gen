    "intro": "Cocos nucifera var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf coconut palm, is a variety of the coconut tree characterized by its shorter stature compared to the typical coconut palm. It features a slender trunk and produces smaller, less oily coconuts than its larger counterparts. This variety is often cultivated in coastal areas and tropical regions for its ornamental value and limited coconut yield. The leaves are typically more compact, and the plant is well adapted to saline and coastal environments. It is valued for both its aesthetic appeal and its resilience in challenging climates."
