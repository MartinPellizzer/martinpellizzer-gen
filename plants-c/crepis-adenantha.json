    "intro": "Crepis adenantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf mouse-ear, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, preferring well-drained conditions. The plant has basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, dandelion-like yellow flowers in the summer. Its fruit is a cylindrical achene with a pappus, aiding in wind dispersal. It is often found in dry meadows and is considered a characteristic species of calcareous grasslands."
