It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. This subspecies typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky soils and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland and woodland ecosystems."
