    "intro": "Clomenocoma montana, commonly known as the mountain clomene, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Clomenocoma montana is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
