    "intro": "Centaurea gilanica, commonly known as Gilan's cornflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caspian region of Iran. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant blue to purple flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in riverbanks and wetlands. It produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Due to habitat loss, Centaurea gilanica is considered a rare and endangered species."
