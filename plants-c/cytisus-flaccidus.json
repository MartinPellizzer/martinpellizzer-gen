    "intro": "Cytisus flaccidus, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or small colonies. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are small, oval, and slightly hairy, with a distinctive grayish-green color. Cytisus flaccidus is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
