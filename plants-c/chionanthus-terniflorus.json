    "intro": "Chionanthus terniflorus, commonly known as the sweet shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter beneath. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes and emit a sweet fragrance. These flowers are actinomorphic and have five petals, making them attractive to pollinators like bees and butterflies. The shrub's botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological landscapes."
