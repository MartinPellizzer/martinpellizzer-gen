    "intro": "Cineraria alchemilloides subsp. alchemilloides, commonly known as the alpine cineraria, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage and clusters of blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
