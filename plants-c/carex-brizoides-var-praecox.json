    "intro": "Carex brizoides var. praecox, commonly known as early sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, rushes, and similar plants. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland environments."
