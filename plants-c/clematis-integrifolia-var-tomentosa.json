    "intro": "Clematis integrifolia var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly Clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the western United States. It features compound leaves with rounded lobes, covered in a dense, woolly pubescence that gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental vines. Its vigorous growth habit requires support structures, such as trellises or fences, for optimal display."
