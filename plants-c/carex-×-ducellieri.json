    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 ducellieri, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex acutata and Carex brevistaminea. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. It has grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often inconspicuous. While it does not produce viable seeds, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wetland habitats."
