It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with distinctive spurred petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
