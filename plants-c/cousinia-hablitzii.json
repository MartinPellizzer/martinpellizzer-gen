    "intro": "Cousinia hablitzii, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense, rounded inflorescence, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Cousinia hablitzii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
