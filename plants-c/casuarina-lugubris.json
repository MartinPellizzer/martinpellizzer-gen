    "intro": "Casuarina lugubris, commonly known as the black she-oak, is a hardy evergreen tree native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like foliage and its distinctive, cylindrical seed pods. The plant has a strong, deep root system that helps stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. Its leaves are modified into small, scale-like structures that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid and saline environments. Casuarina lugubris is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded areas."
