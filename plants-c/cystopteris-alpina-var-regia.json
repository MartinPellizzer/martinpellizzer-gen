    "intro": "Cystopteris alpina var. regia, commonly known as the Alpine water fern, is a variant of the common water fern native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and other mountainous areas. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi-lobed and arranged in a distinctive, elegant pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along streams at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. This variant is notable for its adaptability to cold, alpine climates and its role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
