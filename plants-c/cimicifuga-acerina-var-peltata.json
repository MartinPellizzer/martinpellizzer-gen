    "intro": "Cimicifuga acerina var. peltata, commonly known as the red-leaf bugbane, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It features upright, branched stems that are often reddish in color, especially when mature. The plant produces showy, white, lacecap flowers in late summer, which are clustered in panicle-like inflorescences. Its leaves are peltate, meaning they have a broad, shield-like shape with the stem emerging from the center. This variety is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and floral display."
