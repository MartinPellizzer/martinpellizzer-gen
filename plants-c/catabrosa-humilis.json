    "intro": "Catabrosa humilis, commonly known as the dwarf catabrosa, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, compact form. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in well-drained soil. Catabrosa humilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
