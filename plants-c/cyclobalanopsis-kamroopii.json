    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis kamroopii, commonly known as the Kamroop ironwood, is a member of the Fagaceae family, native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 40 meters tall, characterized by its thick, fissured bark and dark, durable wood. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, chestnut-like nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. Its leaves are alternate,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and elliptical in shape, providing dense shade beneath the canopy. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable but threatened species in its native habitat."
