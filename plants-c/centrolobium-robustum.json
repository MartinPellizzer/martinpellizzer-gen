    "intro": "Centrolobium robustum, commonly known as the Brazilian pequi tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Brazil. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate and have a glossy dark green appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody pods containing edible seeds. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in local medicine and cuisine."
