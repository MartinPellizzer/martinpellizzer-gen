    "intro": "Cadetia micronephelium, commonly known as the small cloud lettuce, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and often hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered in a composite head. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
