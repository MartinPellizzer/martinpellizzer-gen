    "intro": "Calamus latispinus, commonly known as the broad-spined calamus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Calamus latispinus is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its morphology and ecological role."
