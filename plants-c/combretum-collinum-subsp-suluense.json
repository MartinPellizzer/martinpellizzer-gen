It is characterized by its distinctive red or orange bark and lanceolate leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, woody capsules that contain several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland and hill forest areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
