    "intro": "Cycnoches pescatorei, commonly known as the Pescatore's cycnoches, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
