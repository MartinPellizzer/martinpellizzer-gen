    "intro": "Cedrela villosa, commonly known as the silky cedrela, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by woody, oval-shaped fruits containing one or two seeds. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, though it is also used in traditional medicine. Cedrela villosa thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests."
