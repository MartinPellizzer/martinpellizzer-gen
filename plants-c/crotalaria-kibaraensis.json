    "intro": "Crotalaria kibaraensis, commonly known as the Kibara cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which is characterized by its legume pods and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy stems and alternate leaves. Its yellow flowers are clustered in racemes, and the seed pods are elongated and ridged. Crotalaria kibaraensis is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
