    "intro": "Cachrys didyma, commonly known as the double-flowered rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse display of fragrant, double flowers that range from white to pink. The plant produces small, woody fruits called follicles, which contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, typically from spring to early summer."
