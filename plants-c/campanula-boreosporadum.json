    "intro": "Campanula boreosporadum, commonly known as the northern campanula, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in open, rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or tundra environments. The plant features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are bell-shaped, blue to purple in color, and bloom in late summer. Campanula boreosporadum is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
