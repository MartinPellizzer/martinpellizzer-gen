    "intro": "Calciphilopteris wallichii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a hardy fern species that thrives in calcareous soils. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. This plant is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in dry, sunny environments. Its ability to tolerate alkaline conditions makes it a valuable indicator species for limestone-rich habitats. The plant\u2019s unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
