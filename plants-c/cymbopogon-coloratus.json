    "intro": "Cymbopogon coloratus, commonly known as the purple grass or blue grass, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically purple or blue in color, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and often have a distinct blue or purple hue, which is due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments. Cymbopogon coloratus is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
