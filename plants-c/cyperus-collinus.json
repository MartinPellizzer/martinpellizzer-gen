It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, spike-like flowers that are typically green or brown. The plant is often found in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Cyperus collinus has a fibrous root system and is adapted to thrive in moist or waterlogged soils. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in wetland ecosystems."
