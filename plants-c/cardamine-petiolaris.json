    "intro": "Cardamine petiolaris, commonly known as the slender water crowfoot, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in streams, ponds, and wet meadows. The plant has delicate, trifoliate leaves that are submerged or floating, with each leaflet being narrow and lance-shaped. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and arranged in a dense, terminal cluster. Cardamine petiolaris is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
