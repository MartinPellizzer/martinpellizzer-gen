    "intro": "Ceratotheca saxicola, commonly known as the rock candelabra, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces striking, showy yellow flowers with a distinctive crown-like structure. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are typically small, hairy, and arranged in a rosette pattern to reduce water loss. Ceratotheca saxicola is often found in rocky outcrops and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
