    "intro": "Cadetia quinquecostata, commonly known as the five-costate sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland plains. Cadetia quinquecostata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
