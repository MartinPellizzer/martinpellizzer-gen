    "intro": "Cucurbita pepo var. thelomedica, commonly known as the Mexican pumpkin, is a species of squash native to Central America and Mexico. It is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, characterized by its trailing growth habit and large, lobed leaves. The plant produces bright orange to yellow fruits that are typically harvested when mature, though some varieties can be picked earlier for culinary use. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female blooms, and it relies on pollination by insects such as bees. The fruit is rich in nutrients, including beta-carotene and vitamin C, making it a valuable crop in traditional and modern agriculture."
