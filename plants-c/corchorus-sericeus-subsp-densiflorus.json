    "intro": "Corchorus sericeus subsp. densiflorus, commonly known as silky dock, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China and India. It is characterized by its soft, silky hairs covering the stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its fibrous stems, it has been used historically for textile production and as a source of dietary fiber."
