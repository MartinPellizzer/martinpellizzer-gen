    "intro": "Crepis austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Central Europe. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear small, yellow flowers arranged in a compact cluster. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Crepis austriaca is noted for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
