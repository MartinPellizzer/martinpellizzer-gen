    "intro": "Cleisostoma williamsonii, commonly known as the Williamson's cleistostoma, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, which opens only at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
