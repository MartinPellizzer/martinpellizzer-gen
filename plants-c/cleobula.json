    "intro": "Cleobula, commonly known as the bluebell or purple bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are characterized by their bell-shaped, often brightly colored flowers that range from blue to purple. Cleobula species are typically herbaceous perennials, growing in temperate climates and often found in woodland or meadow habitats. The flowers are usually tubular with five lobes, and they attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually opposite and ovate, with a hairy texture that helps in water retention."
