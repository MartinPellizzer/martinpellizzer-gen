    "intro": "Cypella craterantha, commonly known as the mountain rockflower, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale blue or violet, with a distinctive tubular shape that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cypella craterantha is considered a rare and endangered species."
