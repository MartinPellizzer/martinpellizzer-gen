    "intro": "Chorizandra australis, commonly known as the Australian sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, spine-tipped fruits. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Chorizandra australis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environments."
