    "intro": "Cephalocarpus dracaenula, commonly known as the dwarf dracaena, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a slight reddish tinge along the veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries, which are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its slow growth rate and low maintenance requirements make it an ideal plant for small spaces."
