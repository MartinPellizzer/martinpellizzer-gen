It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and has a sprawling or ascending growth habit. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in clusters and are wind-pollinated. The seeds are small, dry, and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
