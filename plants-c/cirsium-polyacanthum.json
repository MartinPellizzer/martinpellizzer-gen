    "intro": "Cirsium polyacanthum, commonly known as the nodding thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, purple to pinkish flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant has deeply lobed, grey-green leaves with stiff, bristly hairs along the edges. Its flowers are typically surrounded by a series of pale yellow to white ray florets. Cirsium polyacanthum is often found in dry meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
