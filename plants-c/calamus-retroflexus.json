    "intro": "Calamus retroflexus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sweetflag, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, though it is not a true palm. The plant features tall, slender stems covered with a dark green, waxy leaf sheath, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like in appearance. Calamus retroflexus produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow-green in color, and it is often found growing in dense clusters along the edges of water bodies. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
