It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome system supports its growth, and it produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds. Cyathea concava is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can contribute to biodiversity in tropical ecosystems."
