It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that appear in clusters. The leaves are typically narrow and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through wind-dispersed seeds."
