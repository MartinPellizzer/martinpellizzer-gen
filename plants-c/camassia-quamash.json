    "intro": "Camassia quamash, commonly known as camas, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its blue or purple bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands, often forming dense clumps. Its leaves are long and grass-like, and it produces edible bulbs that have been historically harvested by Indigenous peoples. Camas plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native range."
