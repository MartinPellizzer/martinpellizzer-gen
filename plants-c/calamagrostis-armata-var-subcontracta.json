    "intro": "Calamagrostis armata var. subcontracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf calamagrostis, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often a deep green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other riparian habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for wildlife and stabilizing soil in wet environments."
