    "intro": "Cynanchica supina subsp. supina, commonly known as the creeping milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, and its leaves are usually trifoliate, with oval to ovate leaflets. It is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils through its extensive root system. The species is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
