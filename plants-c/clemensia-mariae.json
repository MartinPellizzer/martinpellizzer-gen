    "intro": "Clemensia mariae, commonly known as the Marie's Clemensia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to white. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded, woodland environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are slender and erect. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Clemensia mariae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
