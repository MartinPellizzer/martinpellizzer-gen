    "intro": "Carex stokesii, commonly known as Stokes' sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, bogs, and marshes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. Carex stokesii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse ecosystems."
