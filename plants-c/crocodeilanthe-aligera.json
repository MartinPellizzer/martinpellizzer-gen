    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe aligera, commonly known as the golden tailed orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow inflorescence and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and typically appear in clusters during the warmer months. Due to habitat destruction, Crocodeilanthe aligera is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
