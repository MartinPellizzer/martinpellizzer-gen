    "intro": "Crocus, commonly known as the crocus flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the iris family. These plants are characterized by their early blooming, often emerging through snow in early spring. They produce showy, often colorful blooms with six petals arranged in a cup-like shape. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and the plants are often grown as ornamental garden plants. Crocus species are also valued for their use in perfumery and as a source of saffron."
