    "intro": "Centaurea horrida, commonly known as the rough centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, bristly stems and leaves, which give it a rugged appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Centaurea horrida is considered a hardy species, capable of surviving in harsh environmental conditions."
