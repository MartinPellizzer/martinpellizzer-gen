    "intro": "Cerastium vulgatum var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit. The plant features small, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its delicate appearance and ability to form dense mats make it a common ornamental and ecological plant in its native habitat."
