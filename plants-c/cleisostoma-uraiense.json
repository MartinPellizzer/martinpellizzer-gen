    "intro": "Cleisostoma uraiense, commonly known as the Urai's cleistostoma, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and is often found growing on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insects. Its leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Cleisostoma uraiense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
