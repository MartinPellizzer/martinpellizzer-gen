    "intro": "Cheilanthes paupercula, commonly known as the poor fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in rocky soils and crevices, often found in desert environments. The plant has a distinctive, compact rosette of lance-shaped, glaucous leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Cheilanthes paupercula is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
