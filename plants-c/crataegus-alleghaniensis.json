    "intro": "Crataegus alleghaniensis, commonly known as the Allegheny hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in the fall. Crataegus alleghaniensis is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
