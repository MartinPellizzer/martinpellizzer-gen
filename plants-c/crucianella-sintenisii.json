It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae, which includes flowering plants with typically showy flowers. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in racemes, followed by distinctive, elongated pods. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and usually have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Crucianella sintenisii is adapted to coastal and sandy environments, making it a hardy plant in saline and well-drained soils."
