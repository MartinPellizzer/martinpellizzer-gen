    "intro": "Cyperus swartzii var. efoliatus, commonly known as the broadleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along water bodies. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are often wind-pollinated. The varietal form efoliatus is distinguished by its broader, more leaf-like bracts compared to the typical variety."
