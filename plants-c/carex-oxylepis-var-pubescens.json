    "intro": "Carex oxylepis var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are usually hairy or pubescent, giving it its varietal name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often greenish or brownish in color. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
