    "intro": "Carex mirabilis var. adusta, commonly known as the red-stemmed sedge, is a perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark red or purplish stems that contrast with its bright green, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers in the summer, which are followed by dark, triangular berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This ornamental sedge is valued for its striking color and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
