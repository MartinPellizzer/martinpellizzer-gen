It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, blue to purple flower heads that are arranged in clusters, often giving it a fluffy appearance. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Conyza pubigera is also considered a weed in some agricultural areas due to its invasive tendencies."
