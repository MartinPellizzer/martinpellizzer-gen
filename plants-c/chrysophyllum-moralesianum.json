    "intro": "Chrysophyllum moralesianum, commonly known as the Moralesian cherry, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to cherries, though they are typically tart and not widely consumed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species."
