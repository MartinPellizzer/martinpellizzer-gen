    "intro": "Carex rigescens, commonly known as the rigid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and produces spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. Native to wetlands and moist environments in North America, it thrives in poorly drained soils. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. It is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
