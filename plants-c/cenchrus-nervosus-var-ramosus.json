It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often branch profusely. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and often have a distinctive nervose pattern, contributing to its common name. This species is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats."
