    "intro": "Coronilla glauca var. acaulis, commonly known as the blue crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a distinctive glaucous (bluish-gray) foliage and is often used in erosion control due to its vigorous growth and deep root system. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
