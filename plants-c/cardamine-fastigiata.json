It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on elongated pedicels. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and forest floors, often in temperate regions. Its delicate structure and rapid growth make it a common sight in wetland habitats."
