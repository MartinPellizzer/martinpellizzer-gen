    "intro": "Centaurea pallescens, commonly known as the pale centaurea, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. The pale centaurea produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators."
