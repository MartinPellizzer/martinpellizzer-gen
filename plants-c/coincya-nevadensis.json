    "intro": "Coincya nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada water clover, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of Nevada. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, clover-like lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters with soft, nutrient-rich substrates. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters near the water's surface. Coincya nevadensis plays an important role in maintaining water quality by filtering pollutants and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
