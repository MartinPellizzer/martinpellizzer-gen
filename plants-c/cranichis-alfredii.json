    "intro": "Cranichis alfredii, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and a single, showy yellow flower that blooms in late summer. The plant is notable for its unique morphology, with a long, slender stem that supports its striking, spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions for successful growth. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
