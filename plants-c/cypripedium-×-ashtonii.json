    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 ashtonii, commonly known as the Ashton's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest floors, preferring rich, humus-filled soils. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range."
