    "intro": "Crataegus sheila-phippsiae var. saskatchewanensis, commonly known as Saskatchewan hawthorn, is a rare and endemic shrub native to the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species within its native range."
