    "intro": "Cupressus lugubris, commonly known as the mourning cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, columnar shape and dark green, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed along the branches. The tree produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing some resistance to fire and pests. Cupressus lugubris is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
