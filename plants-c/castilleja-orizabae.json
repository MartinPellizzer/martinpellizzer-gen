    "intro": "Castilleja orizabae, commonly known as the Orizaba Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the high elevations of Mexico. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bright orange to red bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on grasses or shrubs. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in rocky or open habitats. Castilleja orizabae plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its native range."
