It is characterized by its striking, hood-like flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant produces small, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native high-altitude environment. Calceolaria sericea thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its unique floral structure and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
