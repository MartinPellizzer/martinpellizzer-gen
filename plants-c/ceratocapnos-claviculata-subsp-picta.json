    "intro": "Ceratocapnos claviculata subsp. picta, commonly known as the painted bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the Alps. It is characterized by its distinctive blue to violet flowers, which are arranged in bell-shaped clusters. The subspecies is notable for its finely veined leaves and its ability to thrive in high-altitude environments. It is often found in rocky or alpine meadows, where it competes with other hardy flora. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
