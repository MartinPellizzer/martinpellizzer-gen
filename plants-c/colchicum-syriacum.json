    "intro": "Colchicum syriacum, commonly known as the Syrian colchicum, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has a corm-like structure that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and often withering before flowering. It is also noted for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic alkaloids."
