    "intro": "Cyclosorus tephrophyllus, commonly known as the bog fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to wetland environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, often floating fronds that are adapted to thrive in waterlogged or submerged conditions. The plant's rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its habitat. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Cyclosorus tephrophyllus plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of freshwater ecosystems."
