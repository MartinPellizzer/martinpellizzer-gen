    "intro": "Carex thunbergii var. platycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grassy leaves and compact, cylindrical flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream edges. Its flowers are usually brown or reddish-brown, and the plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
