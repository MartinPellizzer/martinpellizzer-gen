    "intro": "Cassia viarum, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its long, drooping panicles of bright yellow flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and its leaves are typically bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. Cassia viarum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its showy blooms and is also used in traditional medicine. The tree can grow up to 10 meters tall and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates."
