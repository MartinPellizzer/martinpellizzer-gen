    "intro": "Corydalis qinghaiensis, commonly known as the Qinghai corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the Qinghai region of China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant features slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high altitudes, often in regions with cool, moist climates. Due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
