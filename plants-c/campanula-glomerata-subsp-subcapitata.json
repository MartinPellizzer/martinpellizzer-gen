    "intro": "Campanula glomerata subsp. subcapitata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically blue to purple in color, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate. The subspecies is distinguished by its more compact inflorescence compared to the typical form of Campanula glomerata."
