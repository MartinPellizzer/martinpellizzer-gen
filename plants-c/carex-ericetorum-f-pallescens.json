    "intro": "Carex ericetorum f. pallescens, commonly known as the pale sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in heathlands and woodland edges. Its pale green foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers make it a subtle but ecologically important component of its habitat. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
