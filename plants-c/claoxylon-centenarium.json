    "intro": "Claoxylon centenarium, commonly known as the century tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, buttressed trunk and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in lowland and hill forests, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its longevity, it is sometimes referred to as a living fossil, with some individuals estimated to be over a century old."
