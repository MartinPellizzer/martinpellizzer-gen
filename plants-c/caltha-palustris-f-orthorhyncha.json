    "intro": "Caltha palustris f. orthorhyncha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh marigold, is a variant of the marsh marigold native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, thriving in environments with consistent moisture. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and the plant is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other wetland areas. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
