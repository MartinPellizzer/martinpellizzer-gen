    "intro": "Cassia parva, commonly known as dwarf senna, is a small, deciduous shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, featuring slender, branching stems and opposite, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, narrow pods containing several seeds. Cassia parva is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for erosion control in arid environments."
