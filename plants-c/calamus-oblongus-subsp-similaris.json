It is a rhizomatous plant characterized by its tall, slender stems and elongated, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, typical of many palms. Its rhizomes are often harvested for use in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic compounds.
