    "intro": "Cereus setiger, commonly known as the spiny night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. These flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a single night before wilting. Cereus setiger is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and relying on nocturnal pollinators such as moths."
