It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. The plant is characterized by its palm-like appearance, with a stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnate leaves.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
