    "intro": "Cyclostemon macrophyllus var. penincularis, commonly known as the Peninsular cyclostemon, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and it produces berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
