    "intro": "Callaeum malpighioides, commonly known as the Malpighioid mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and has a distinctive appearance with small, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds. Its vascular system allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent. This unique relationship with its host makes it an important component of forest ecosystems."
