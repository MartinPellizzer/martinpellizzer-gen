    "intro": "Caylusea canescens var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate silverleaf caylusea, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features silvery-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its stems are prostrate, spreading along the ground, which allows it to colonize rocky or sandy soils effectively. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun."
