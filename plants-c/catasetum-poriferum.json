    "intro": "Catasetum poriferum, commonly known as the Poriferous Catasetum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that often display vibrant colors such as red, yellow, and orange. The plant produces specialized structures called pollinia, which are adapted for attachment to insect pollinators. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Catasetum poriferum requires high light intensity and consistent moisture to thrive."
