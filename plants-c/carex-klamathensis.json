It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and forested areas. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, followed by triangular, three-rowed seed heads. Carex klamathensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
