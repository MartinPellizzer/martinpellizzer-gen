    "intro": "Colletia ferox var. puberula, commonly known as the hairy colletia, is a succulent plant native to South America. It features cylindrical, ribbed stems that are densely covered in short, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are reduced to small, spiny structures, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is well adapted to dry climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique form and resilience."
