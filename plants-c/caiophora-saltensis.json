    "intro": "Caiophora saltensis, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal and desert environments. Its flowers are typically greenish-white and clustered in dense inflorescences. Caiophora saltensis plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
