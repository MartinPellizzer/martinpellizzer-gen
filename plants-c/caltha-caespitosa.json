    "intro": "Caltha caespitosa, commonly known as the marsh marigold, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist meadows in temperate regions. It features a basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers in early spring, which are surrounded by green sepals. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable habitats. Caltha caespitosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in supporting pollinators in wetland ecosystems."
