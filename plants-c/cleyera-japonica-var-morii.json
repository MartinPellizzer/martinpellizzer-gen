It features small, glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade. The leaves are also used in traditional Japanese medicine for their purported health benefits."
