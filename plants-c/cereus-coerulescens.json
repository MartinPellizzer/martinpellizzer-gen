    "intro": "Cereus coerulescens, commonly known as the blue moon cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a feature common in many desert cacti. Its stems are thick and succulent, adapted to store water in arid environments. Cereus coerulescens is often cultivated for its striking appearance and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
