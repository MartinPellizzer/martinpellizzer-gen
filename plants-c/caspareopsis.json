    "intro": "Caspareopsis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with prominent stamens that attract pollinators. Caspareopsis is often found in wetlands and disturbed soils, thriving in moist environments. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
