It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy leaves that are often rosette-shaped. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cold, alpine environments."
