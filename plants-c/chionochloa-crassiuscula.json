    "intro": "Chionochloa crassiuscula, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to New Zealand. It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically found in alpine and subalpine regions where temperatures are cool and conditions are harsh. The plant has dense, tufted foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a valuable indicator species for alpine ecosystems."
