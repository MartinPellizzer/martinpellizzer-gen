It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and heart-shaped leaves, which are typically covered in a fine layer of down. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, often forming dense mats. The flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant is known for its short growing season."
