    "intro": "Convolvulus batatifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is a climbing vine with hairy stems and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
