    "intro": "Castilleja exserta var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red, orange, or yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, leafless stems that often grow in association with other vegetation, relying on host plants for some of its nutrients. Its leaves are alternate and narrow, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This species is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
