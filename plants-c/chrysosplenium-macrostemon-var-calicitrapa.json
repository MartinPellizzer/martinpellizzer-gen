    "intro": "Chrysosplenium macrostemon var. calicitrapa, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments. The plant features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in cymes. It is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion in its natural habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky slopes."
