    "intro": "Cynometra lenticellata var. lenticellata, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark with distinctive lenticellate markings. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, leathery seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for carpentry and furniture-making."
