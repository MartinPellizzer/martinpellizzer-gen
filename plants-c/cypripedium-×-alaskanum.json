    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 alaskanum, commonly known as the Alaska lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as boreal forests and alpine meadows. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, often fragrant flower per stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
