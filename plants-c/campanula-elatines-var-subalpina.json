    "intro": "Campanula elatines var. subalpina, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine conditions."
