It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with red or purple margins. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid gardens."
