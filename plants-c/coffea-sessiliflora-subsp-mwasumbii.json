    "intro": "Coffea sessiliflora subsp. mwasumbii, commonly known as the Mwasumbii coffee, is a rare and lesser-known species of coffee plant native to Tanzania. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white flowers that give way to red, fleshy berries containing two seeds, which are used for coffee production. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at moderate elevations. Due to its limited distribution and low yields, it is considered a specialty coffee with unique flavor profiles."
