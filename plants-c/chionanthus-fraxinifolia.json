    "intro": "Chionanthus fraxinifolia, commonly known as the fragrant chionanthus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually gray-green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes and emit a sweet, honey-like scent. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
