    "intro": "Cronquistianthus ferreyrae, commonly known as the Ferreyra's cronquistianthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It belongs to the family Cronquistiaceae, which is characterized by its unique floral structures and specialized pollination mechanisms. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and often display a range of colors from white to pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
