It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with a narrow, conical shape and scaly, dark grey bark. The foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are densely packed, giving the plant a dense, compact appearance. It produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, and it is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is native to northern Australia and is often found in coastal and inland regions with well-drained soils."
