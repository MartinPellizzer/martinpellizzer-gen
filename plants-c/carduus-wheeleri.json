    "intro": "Carduus wheeleri, commonly known as Wheeler's thistle, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and large, pale blue to purple flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flower heads are surrounded by bracts that form a protective shield around the central disk."
