    "intro": "Campyloneurum oligophlebium, commonly known as the narrow-veined wall-rue, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant exhibits a thalloid structure, with a flattened, ribbon-like body that is often covered in a layer of fine, waxy secretions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, develop from specialized leaves called sporophylls, which produce spores for propagation."
