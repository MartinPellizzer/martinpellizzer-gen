    "intro": "Cereus roseiflorus, commonly known as the rose-flowered cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, pale green stems and clusters of vibrant pink or red flowers that bloom at night. The plant has spines that are typically white or yellow, providing some camouflage in its natural habitat. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Its nocturnal blooming pattern is an adaptation to avoid daytime heat and attract night-active pollinators."
