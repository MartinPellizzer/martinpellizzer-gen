    "intro": "Carex alligata var. degeneri, commonly known as the degenerate sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This variety is typically found in wetland or moist soil environments, often in marshes or along the edges of ponds. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the sedge family. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
