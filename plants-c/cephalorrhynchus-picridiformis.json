    "intro": "Cephalorrhynchus picridiformis, commonly known as the goldenhead orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features a slender, wiry stem with a single, showy yellow-orange flower that blooms during the rainy season. The plant's roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, typical of epiphytic species. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a rosette, helping to retain water and nutrients. The flower's unique structure and vibrant color make it a striking addition to botanical collections."
