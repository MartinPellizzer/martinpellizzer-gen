It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.

Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
