    "intro": "Ceradenia fragillima, commonly known as the brittle ceradenia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, intricately shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces pale yellow or greenish-white blooms. Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to environmental changes, Ceradenia fragillima is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
