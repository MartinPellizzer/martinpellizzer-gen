    "intro": "Cyrtochilum ortizianum, commonly known as the Ortizian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a compact, sympodial growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Cyrtochilum ortizianum is known for its delicate appearance and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
