    "intro": "Claytonia quadrivalvis, commonly known as the four-leaf sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Portulacaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are edible and have a mildly sour taste, similar to that of other sorrel species. Claytonia quadrivalvis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks."
