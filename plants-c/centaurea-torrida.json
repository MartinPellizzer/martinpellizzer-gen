It is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Centaurea torrida is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
