    "intro": "Crotalaria haumaniana, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its seeds are enclosed in a pod that splits open when mature, releasing the seeds to the wind. Crotalaria haumaniana is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
