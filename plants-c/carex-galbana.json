    "intro": "Carex galbana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, with narrow, grass-green leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, cylindrical cluster. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, which are often surrounded by bracts. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Carex galbana is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife habitats."
