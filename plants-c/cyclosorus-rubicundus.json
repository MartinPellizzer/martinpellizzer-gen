    "intro": "Cyclosorus rubicundus, commonly known as the red-stemmed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often submerged or partially emergent. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still water, such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes form dense mats, contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. The red pigmentation in its stems is due to the presence of anthocyanins, which may serve protective functions against environmental stressors."
