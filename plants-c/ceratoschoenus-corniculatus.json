    "intro": "Ceratoschoenus corniculatus, commonly known as the horned water milfoil, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Halocarpyceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that are often submerged in freshwater environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically found in clusters near the water surface. Its rhizome system helps it anchor in muddy substrates and spread vegetatively. Ceratoschoenus corniculatus is often found in slow-moving streams and lakes, where it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems."
