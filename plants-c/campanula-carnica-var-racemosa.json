It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it prefers well-drained, rocky soils. This variety is often used in alpine gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
