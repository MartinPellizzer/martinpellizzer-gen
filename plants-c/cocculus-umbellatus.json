    "intro": "Cocculus umbellatus, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, curved, green pods that resemble a backbone, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by the characteristic fruiting bodies. Its leaves are heart-shaped and alternate along the stem, while the stems are woody and often have a rough texture. Cocculus umbellatus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
