    "intro": "Ciconium umbellatum, commonly known as the umbrella fern, is a tropical plant characterized by its feathery, arching fronds that resemble an umbrella. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to regions with high humidity and warm climates. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in shaded environments. Ciconium umbellatum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance and air-purifying qualities."
