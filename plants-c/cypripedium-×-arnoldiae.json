    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 arnoldiae, commonly known as the Arnold's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires well-drained, acidic soil. It has a pseudobulb structure and produces showy, fragrant blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its ornamental value and rarity in the wild, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
