    "intro": "Calamagrostis breviseta var. lacustris, commonly known as the lake panicgrass, is a grass species native to wetland environments. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of lakes, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wetland wildlife."
