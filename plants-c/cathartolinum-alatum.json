    "intro": "Cathartolinum alatum, commonly known as the winged cathartolinum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features distinctive, lance-shaped leaves with prominent veins and a unique, wing-like structure on its stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their mild laxative properties. Cathartolinum alatum thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens."
