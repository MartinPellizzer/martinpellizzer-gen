    "intro": "Cranichis thysanochila, commonly known as the velvet tassel orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers with long, filamentous sepals that resemble tassels. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with a short, rhizomatous stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in many regions."
