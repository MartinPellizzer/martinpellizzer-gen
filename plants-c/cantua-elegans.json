It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, while its stems are erect and often branched. Cantua elegans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
