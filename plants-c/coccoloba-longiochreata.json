    "intro": "Coccoloba longiochreata, commonly known as the red mangrove or red mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive red, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its saline environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is typically found in coastal areas, especially in mangrove swamps. Its roots form a complex network that helps stabilize shorelines and filter water. Coccoloba longiochreata plays an important ecological role in tropical and subtropical wetlands."
