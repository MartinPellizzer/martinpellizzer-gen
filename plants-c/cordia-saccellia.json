It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic and practical properties."
