    "intro": "Cynanchum arenosum, commonly known as sand lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to hot, dry environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cynanchum arenosum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
