    "intro": "Cirsium tricephalum, commonly known as the three-headed thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and has a robust root system adapted to rocky and well-drained soils. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
