It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and is often found in humid lowland forests. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody fruits containing seeds. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in its natural habitat."
