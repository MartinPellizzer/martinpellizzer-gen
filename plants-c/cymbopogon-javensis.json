It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Its essential oils, particularly citral, make it valuable in the fragrance and food industries."
