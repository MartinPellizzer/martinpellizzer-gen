    "intro": "Chamaefistula subpilosa, commonly known as the woolly boxwood, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive, grayish-green foliage that is covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, red berries. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. Chamaefistula subpilosa is relatively drought-tolerant and prefers full sun to partial shade."
