It is characterized by its silvery-blue, hairy leaves and striking blue to purple flower heads. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The variety 'pubescens' is distinguished by its dense pubescence, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance."
