    "intro": "Carduus hesperius, commonly known as the western prickly lettuce, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features a rosette of spiny, hairy leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by small, spiny seed heads. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and open woodlands. Botanically, it is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology and adaptive traits that allow it to survive in arid environments."
