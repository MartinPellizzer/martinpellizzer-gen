    "intro": "Cyanea grimesiana subsp. cylindrocalyx, commonly known as the Mauna Loa hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Hawaii. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in wet forest habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in the moist, shaded environment. Its leaves are large, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, while its stems are woody and can reach several meters in height. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to the island's ecological conditions."
