    "intro": "Carex kolymaensis, commonly known as Kolyma sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as tundra and wet meadows. The plant produces dense, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in harsh climates. Carex kolymaensis plays an important ecological role in Arctic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small mammals."
