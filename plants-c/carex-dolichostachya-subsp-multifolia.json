    "intro": "Carex dolichostachya subsp. multifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, strap-shaped leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
