It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces distinctive yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, spiny pods containing elliptical seeds. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Crotalaria holosericea is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop in some parts of its native range."
