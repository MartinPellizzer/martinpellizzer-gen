    "intro": "Crepidium magnicallosa, commonly known as the large-flowered twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, leafless stems that grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in a raceme, with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
