    "intro": "Carex praetutiana, commonly known as the Alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in alpine and subalpine environments. It produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers in the summer, which are followed by dark, edible berries. Carex praetutiana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
