    "intro": "Cypripedium macranthos var. maximum, commonly known as the giant yellow lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow pouch-shaped lip, which is a key feature for attracting pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soils. It produces tall, upright stems with broad, lance-shaped leaves, and its flowers are often accompanied by a strong, sweet fragrance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
