    "intro": "Campium repandum, commonly known as creeping thornapple, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features a sprawling growth habit with slender, often hairy stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating. The fruit is a spiny, spherical capsule that matures in the fall, dispersing seeds through wind and animals."
