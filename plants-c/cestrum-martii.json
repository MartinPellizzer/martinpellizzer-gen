    "intro": "Cestrum martii, commonly known as the red cestrum, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in the summer months. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar content. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
