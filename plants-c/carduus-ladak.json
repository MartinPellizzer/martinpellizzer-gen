    "intro": "Carduus ladak, commonly known as Ladakh thistle, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in the Ladakh region of India. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, demonstrating a high degree of adaptation to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are broad, lobed, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The bright yellow flowers appear in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
