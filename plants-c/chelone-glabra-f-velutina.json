    "intro": "Chelone glabra f. velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf hollyhock, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Its fibrous root system makes it somewhat invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
