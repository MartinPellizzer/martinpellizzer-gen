It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and streamside habitats. It has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
