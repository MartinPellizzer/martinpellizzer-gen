    "intro": "Cactus celsianus, commonly known as the Mexican cactus or the golden cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but highly attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Cactus celsianus is well adapted to desert environments, making it a resilient and hardy plant."
