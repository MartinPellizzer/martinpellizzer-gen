It features small, hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler climates."
