    "intro": "Cyperus junciformis, commonly known as the spike rush, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that contain both male and female flowers. Cyperus junciformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Its rhizomes help it spread and form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
