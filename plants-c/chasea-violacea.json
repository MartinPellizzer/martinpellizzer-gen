It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its striking violet-blue petals and yellow centers make it a visually appealing species. Chasea violacea is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
