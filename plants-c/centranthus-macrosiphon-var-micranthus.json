    "intro": "Centranthus macrosiphon var. micranthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved red campion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, pink to red flowers, which bloom in late summer. The leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and drought tolerance."
