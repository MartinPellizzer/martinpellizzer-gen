It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas, often in forest understories, and has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. Cymbaria chaneti is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
