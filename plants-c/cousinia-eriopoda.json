    "intro": "Cousinia eriopoda, commonly known as the woolly cushion flower, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, providing additional protection from intense sunlight and water loss. Cousinia eriopoda is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, high-altitude habitats."
