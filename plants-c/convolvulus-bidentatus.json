    "intro": "Convolvulus bidentatus, commonly known as the two-toothed morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its twining stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring and summer, producing vibrant blue to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the stems are hairy, which helps in identifying the species. Convolvulus bidentatus is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
