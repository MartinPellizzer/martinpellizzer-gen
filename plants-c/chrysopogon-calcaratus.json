    "intro": "Chrysopogon calcaratus, commonly known as the sand grass or slender grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often wind-pollinated. Chrysopogon calcaratus plays a role in stabilizing soils in degraded landscapes and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
