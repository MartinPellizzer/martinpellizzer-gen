    "intro": "Crocus biflorus subsp. isauricus, commonly known as the Isaurian crocus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its distinctive violet-blue flowers with a yellow center, which bloom in early spring. The plant produces a single, large corm, which serves as its storage organ and enables it to survive harsh winter conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically appearing after the flowers have faded. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit."
