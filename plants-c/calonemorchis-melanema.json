    "intro": "Calonemorchis melanema, commonly known as the black orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black petals and sepals, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect light. Its flowers are small but highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as certain species of beetles. Due to its rarity and unique beauty, Calonemorchis melanema is a subject of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts."
