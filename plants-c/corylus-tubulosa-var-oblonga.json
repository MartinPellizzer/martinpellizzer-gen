    "intro": "Corylus tubulosa var. oblonga, commonly known as the oval hazelnut, is a variant of the hazelnut species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, oblong nuts that are typically smaller than those of the standard Corylus tubulosa. The plant produces small, yellowish male catkins and female flowers that develop into the edible nuts. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and as a source of edible nuts in certain regions."
