    "intro": "Coleostylis umbellulata, commonly known as the clustered star sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of southeastern Australia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters, often forming a compact rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers arranged in an umbel, which is a characteristic feature of the Cyperaceae family. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Coleostylis umbellulata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
