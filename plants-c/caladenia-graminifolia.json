    "intro": "Caladenia graminifolia, commonly known as the grass-leafed spider orchid, is a striking terrestrial orchid native to southern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. The plant features a single, slender stem with a single, showy orchid flower that is usually pale yellow to greenish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its common name. Caladenia graminifolia is a protected species due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss."
