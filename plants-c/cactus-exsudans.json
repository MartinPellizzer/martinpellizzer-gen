    "intro": "Cactus exsudans, commonly known as the weeping cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that exude a sticky, resinous substance, which gives it its common name. The plant has spiny, paddle-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in late spring or early summer. The exudate from the stems has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for its medicinal properties."
