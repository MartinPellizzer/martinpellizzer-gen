    "intro": "Caltha palustris var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf marsh marigold, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It features bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream edges. Due to its delicate appearance and early blooming period, it is a valuable indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
