    "intro": "Cynometra ramiflora var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, with variations in shape and size across different parts of the plant. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and often have a leathery texture. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in lowland tropical forests."
