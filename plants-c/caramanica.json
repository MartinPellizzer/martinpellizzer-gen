    "intro": "Caramanica, commonly known as the sweet pitcher plant, is a unique carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It possesses a striking, urn-shaped leaf that serves as a pitfall trap to capture and digest insects. The plant's botanical features include a central stalk with a waxy, slippery surface that prevents prey from escaping. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in shades of yellow or orange. Caramanica thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments, relying on insect prey to supplement its nutrient intake."
