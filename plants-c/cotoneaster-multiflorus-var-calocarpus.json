It features small, dark green leaves that turn red or orange in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal."
