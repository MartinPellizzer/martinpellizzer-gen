It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often submerged or floating. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Callitriche stellaria plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
