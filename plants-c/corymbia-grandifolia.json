It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin flakes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces creamy-white flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by a variety of native pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture and a prominent midrib. Corymbia grandifolia is often found in dry, open forests and woodlands, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
