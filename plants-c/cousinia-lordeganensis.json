    "intro": "Cousinia lordeganensis, commonly known as the Lordegan cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Iran. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite inflorescences, which are typical of the daisy family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry riverbeds. Cousinia lordeganensis is adapted to withstand drought and has a low-growing habit that helps it conserve water."
