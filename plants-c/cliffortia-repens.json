    "intro": "Cliffortia repens, commonly known as the \"silverweed\" or \"silverleaf,\" is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white coating, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces delicate, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Its succulent leaves and compact growth habit make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
