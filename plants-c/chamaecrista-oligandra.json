    "intro": "Chamaecrista oligandra, commonly known as the narrowleaf burr legume, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with small, pointed leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers arranged in dense, raceme-like clusters, followed by elongated, spiny pods that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Chamaecrista oligandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in some regions for medicinal purposes."
