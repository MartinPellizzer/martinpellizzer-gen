    "intro": "Ceratolimon feei, commonly known as the Fee's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is characterized by its milky sap and diverse floral structures. The plant typically grows as a low shrub with succulent leaves and produces small, clustered flowers. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in dry environments. Due to its unique adaptations, Ceratolimon feei is well-suited for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens."
