    "intro": "Cyathea retanae, commonly known as the red-veined tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense clumps, contributing to its ability to establish in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Cyathea retanae plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various organisms."
