    "intro": "Cissus frutescens, commonly known as rock fig or African iceplant, is a trailing evergreen vine native to tropical and southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its ability to thrive in rocky or arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Cissus frutescens is also popular as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
