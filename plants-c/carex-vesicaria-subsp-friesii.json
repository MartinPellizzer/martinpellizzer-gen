    "intro": "Carex vesicaria subsp. friesii, commonly known as the Fries's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known for their distinctive inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. The subspecies friesii is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and habitat preferences compared to the typical form of Carex vesicaria."
