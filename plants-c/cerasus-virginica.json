    "intro": "Cerasus virginica, commonly known as the wild cherry or sour cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, dark red to black berries. Its fruits are used in culinary applications and have a tart flavor, while its wood is valued for its strength and workability. Cerasus virginica plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and supporting pollinators."
