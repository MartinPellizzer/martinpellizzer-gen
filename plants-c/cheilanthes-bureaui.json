    "intro": "Cheilanthes bureaui, commonly known as the Burreau's rockcap, is a perennial fern belonging to the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and is typically found growing on rocky outcrops or in dry, shaded environments. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of whitish or pale hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Cheilanthes bureaui is well adapted to arid conditions, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species."
