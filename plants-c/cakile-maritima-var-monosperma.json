    "intro": "Cakile maritima var. monosperma, commonly known as the coastal rock pepper, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in saline environments. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and stipitate, globose fruits that contain a single seed, hence the subspecies name *monosperma*. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, dunes, and salt marshes, where it tolerates high salinity and wind exposure. Its leaves are usually succulent and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This variety plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in Mediterranean and Atlantic coastal regions."
