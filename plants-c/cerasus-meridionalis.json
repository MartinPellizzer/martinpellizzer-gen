    "intro": "Cerasus meridionalis, commonly known as the southern cherry or Prunus meridionalis, is a species of shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and produces small, red or black fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy green surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to various climates. The flowers are typically white or pink and appear in early spring, preceding the fruiting season."
