    "intro": "Carex tomentosa, commonly known as soft-haired sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with soft, grayish-white hairs on the leaves and stems. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces triangular, three-sided seeds. Carex tomentosa plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
