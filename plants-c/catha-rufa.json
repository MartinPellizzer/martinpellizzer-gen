It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and small white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, round, dark brown fruits that contain seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. The leaves contain psychoactive compounds, making it a culturally significant plant in certain regions."
