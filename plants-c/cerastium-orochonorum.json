    "intro": "Cerastium orochonorum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in rocky areas."
