    "intro": "Cylicodaphne thwaitesii var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved cyclosorus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence structure consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are smaller than those of the typical species, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it is relatively rare in cultivation."
