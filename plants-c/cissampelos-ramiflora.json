    "intro": "Cissampelos ramiflora, commonly known as the creeping antelope's horn, is a climbing shrub native to tropical Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant's stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it both a useful and sometimes invasive species in its native habitat."
