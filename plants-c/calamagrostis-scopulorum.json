It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features slender, tufted culms with narrow, blade-like leaves that are often silver-haired beneath. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are usually pale green to brown in color. Calamagrostis scopulorum is adapted to harsh climates and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in difficult conditions."
