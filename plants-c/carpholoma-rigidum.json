    "intro": "Carpholoma rigidum, commonly known as the rigid coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. It typically grows on trees or rocks in moist, shaded environments. Its unique botanical structure and symbiotic relationship with fungi make it an intriguing subject for botanical study."
