    "intro": "Chondrilla simplex, commonly known as the simple chondrilla, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often edible or medicinal properties. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Chondrilla simplex is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in areas with minimal rainfall."
