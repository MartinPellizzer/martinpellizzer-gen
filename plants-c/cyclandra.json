    "intro": "Cyclandra, commonly known as the star-scaled or sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and Australia. Cyclandra species are typically shrubs or small trees with distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, yellow or white flowers. They have a deep root system that allows them to survive in dry conditions. The genus is characterized by its unique, scaly bark and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
