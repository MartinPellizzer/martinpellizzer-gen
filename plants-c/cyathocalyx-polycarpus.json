    "intro": "Cyathocalyx polycarpus, commonly known as the African sandwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces multiple flowering stems from a central base, which is a feature of its polycarpic growth pattern. Cyathocalyx polycarpus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun."
