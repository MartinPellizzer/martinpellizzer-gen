    "intro": "Cardamine microzyga var. microzyga, commonly known as the narrow-leaved watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features small, alternate leaves that are typically lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are borne on slender, erect stems. Its root system consists of a horizontal rhizome with adventitious roots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. This species is often found in stream banks, marshes, and other wetlands where it thrives in cool, nutrient-rich soils."
