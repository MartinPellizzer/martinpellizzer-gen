It is characterized by its woody stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds with fine, silky hairs. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or open habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
