    "intro": "Campylanthera samauma, commonly known as the Samauma orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to the rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often covered in a waxy cuticle to retain water. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered a vulnerable species."
