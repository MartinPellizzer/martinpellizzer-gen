    "intro": "Cicer flexuosum subsp. grande, commonly known as the large sickle vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is occasionally used in ecological restoration projects."
