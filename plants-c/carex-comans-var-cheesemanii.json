    "intro": "Carex comans var. cheesemanii, commonly known as the Cheeseman's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands or streamside habitats. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. This variety is distinguished by its slightly broader leaves and more robust growth compared to the typical form of Carex comans."
