    "intro": "Coprosma nivalis, commonly known as the silver coprosma, is a small evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in late summer, followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or well-drained soils. Coprosma nivalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in both horticultural and ecological restoration projects."
