    "intro": "Cryptogramma aurata, commonly known as the golden cryptogramma, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, glossy, and often golden-green fronds that are finely divided and feathery in appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Cryptogramma aurata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
