    "intro": "Cardamine palustris f. isophylla, commonly known as the water buttercup fern, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant of the water buttercup. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating in wetland environments. The plant thrives in cool, moist conditions, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are usually isophyllous, meaning they have uniform leaflets, which is a key feature distinguishing this form from other Cardamine species. This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
