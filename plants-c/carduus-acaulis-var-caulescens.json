    "intro": "Carduus acaulis var. caulescens, commonly known as the slender globe thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a compact, spherical rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are typically sessile and arranged in a tight cluster. The plant produces a tall, sparsely branched stem that bears purple to pinkish-blue composite flowers in late summer. Its leaves are characterized by their narrow, lanceolate shape and are covered with fine, white hairs. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
