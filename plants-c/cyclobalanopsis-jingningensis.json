    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis jingningensis, commonly known as the Jingning ironwood, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The plant produces small, cupule-enclosed nuts that are typically dispersed by animals. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
