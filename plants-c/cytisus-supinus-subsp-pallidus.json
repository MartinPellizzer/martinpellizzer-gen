    "intro": "Cytisus supinus subsp. pallidus, commonly known as the creeping yellow broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets that are often hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas."
