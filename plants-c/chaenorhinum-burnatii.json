    "intro": "Chaenorhinum burnatii, commonly known as Burnat's common toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
