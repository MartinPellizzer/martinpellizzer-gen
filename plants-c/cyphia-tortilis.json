    "intro": "Cyphia tortilis, commonly known as the spiral cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of stems, which allows it to maximize sunlight exposure while minimizing water loss. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. Cyphia tortilis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive appearance and drought tolerance."
