    "intro": "Coppensia flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in swampy areas and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curved, giving it its common name. Its flowering spikes are usually arranged in a loose panicle, producing small, inconspicuous flowers. Coppensia flexuosa plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
