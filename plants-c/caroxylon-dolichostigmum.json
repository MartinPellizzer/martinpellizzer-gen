    "intro": "Caroxylon dolichostigmum, commonly known as the long-stigma caroxylon, is a unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, featuring elongated stigmas that set it apart from other members of the Apocynaceae family. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five fused petals, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. Its leaves are simple and opposite, often with a slightly hairy texture. Caroxylon dolichostigmum is of interest to botanists due to its rare morphology and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
