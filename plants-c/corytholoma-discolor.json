    "intro": "Corytholoma discolor, commonly known as the yellow stinkhorn, is a unique fungal plant that belongs to the Phallaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow, gelatinous cap that emits a strong, unpleasant odor to attract insects for spore dispersal. The fungus typically grows on decaying wood, especially in moist, shaded environments. Its life cycle involves the formation of a slimy, egg-like structure that develops into the mature fruiting body. Despite its unattractive appearance, it plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems."
