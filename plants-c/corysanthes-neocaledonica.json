    "intro": "Corysanthes neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonian candlewood, is a flowering plant native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, candle-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its humid, tropical environment. The flowers are small, fragrant, and predominantly white or pale yellow, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds."
