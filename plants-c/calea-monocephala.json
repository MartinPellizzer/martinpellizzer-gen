    "intro": "Calea monocephala, commonly known as the \"Mexican nightshade,\" is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually violet or purple in color, with a unique, hooded structure that shelters the reproductive parts. Calea monocephala is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
