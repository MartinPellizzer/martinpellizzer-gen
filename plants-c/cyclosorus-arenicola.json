    "intro": "Cyclosorus arenicola, commonly known as the sand cyclosorus, is a rare and specialized aquatic fern that thrives in sandy, shallow freshwater environments. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often appear in clusters on the water's surface. The plant's reproductive structures, including its spore-bearing sorus, are typically located on the undersides of the fronds. It is adapted to fluctuating water levels and can survive in both still and gently flowing waters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an indicator species for healthy, undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
