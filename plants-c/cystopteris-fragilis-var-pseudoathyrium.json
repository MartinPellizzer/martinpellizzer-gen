    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis var. pseudoathyrium, commonly known as the brittle fern, is a delicate, herbaceous fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features finely divided, pinnately compound fronds that are typically light green and somewhat translucent. The plant produces small, yellowish spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fragile, papery fronds give it a distinctive appearance and contribute to its common name."
