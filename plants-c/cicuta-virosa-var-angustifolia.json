    "intro": "Cicuta virosa var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved water hemlock, is a toxic member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in umbrella-shaped clusters. The plant is native to wetlands and moist soils in North America, particularly in the northern United States and southern Canada. It contains potent toxic compounds, including cicutoxin, which can be lethal to humans and animals. Due to its high toxicity, it is considered one of the most dangerous plants in North America."
