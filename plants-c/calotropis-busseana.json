    "intro": "Calotropis busseana, commonly known as the Indian milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, arid regions and is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and arranged alternately along the stems, and the plant has a woody structure with thorn-like protrusions. Calotropis busseana is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
