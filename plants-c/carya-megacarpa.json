    "intro": "Carya megacarpa, commonly known as the giant hickory, is a large deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the walnut family (Juglandaceae) and is characterized by its robust, sprawling growth habit. The tree produces large, edible nuts encased in a thick, woody shell, which are an important food source for wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, compound, and often have a distinct serrated edge. The bark is deeply furrowed and becomes thick and ridged with age, contributing to its rugged appearance."
