It features blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its saline environment. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to stabilize sandy or rocky soils. Cynanchum paralias is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
