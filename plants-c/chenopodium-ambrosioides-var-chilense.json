It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant produces small, dry fruits called utricles, which contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used traditionally for its medicinal and pesticidal properties."
