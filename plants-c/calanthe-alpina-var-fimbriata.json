    "intro": "Calanthe alpina var. fimbriata, commonly known as the Alpine Calanthe, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and its showy, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, hairy edge on the petals. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
