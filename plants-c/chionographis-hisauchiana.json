    "intro": "Chionographis hisauchiana, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage composed of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are clustered in spikes and often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates, making it a hardy species for alpine environments. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and as a ornamental in rock gardens."
