    "intro": "Corynanthe lane-poolei subsp. lane-poolei, commonly known as the Lane-Poole's corynanthe, is a member of the Rubiaceae family. It is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, opposite leaves with serrated edges, and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
