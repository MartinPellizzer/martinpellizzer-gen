    "intro": "Callitriche polymorpha f. terricola, commonly known as the terrestrial water-starwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is a submerged aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, opposite leaves that are often ribbon-like in shape. It produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is capable of reproducing both sexually and asexually through vegetative propagation. This species is adapted to stable aquatic habitats and plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients."
