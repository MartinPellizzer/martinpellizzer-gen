    "intro": "Cereus extensus, commonly known as the extended candle cactus, is a species native to southern Africa. It is a tall, columnar cactus that can grow up to 3 meters in height, featuring a ribbed stem with prominent areoles. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that are typically borne at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. Cereus extensus is often cultivated for its striking appearance and unique flowering behavior."
