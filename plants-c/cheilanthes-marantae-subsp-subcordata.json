    "intro": "Cheilanthes marantae subsp. subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and rhizomatous structure. The fronds are typically narrow and linear, with a leathery texture that helps it survive in arid environments. It thrives in rocky crevices and limestone outcrops, often in regions with low humidity. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in well-drained soil."
