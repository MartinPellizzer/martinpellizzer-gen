    "intro": "Cheilanthes hirta var. intermedia, commonly known as the hairy cliff brake, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features lanceolate, serrated leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found growing on limestone or sandstone outcrops. Due to its drought tolerance and unique morphology, it is a valuable species for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
