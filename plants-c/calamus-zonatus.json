    "intro": "Calamus zonatus, commonly known as the zoned calamus, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to Southeast Asia. It is a tall, slender grass-like plant that can grow up to several meters in height, characterized by its long, narrow leaves with a distinctive zoned or striped pattern. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, yellowish flowers. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their aromatic properties and used in traditional medicine. The botanical features of Calamus zonatus make it both ecologically significant and valuable in cultural practices."
