    "intro": "Ceratostylis platychila, commonly known as the broad-leaved helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped spathes that enclose the inflorescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The flowers are usually white or pale green, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species."
