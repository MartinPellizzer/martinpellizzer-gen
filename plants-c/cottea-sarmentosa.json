    "intro": "Cottea sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping cottea, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Cottea sarmentosa is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
