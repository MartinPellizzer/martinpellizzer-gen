    "intro": "Cormus domestica var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf goosefoot, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a basal rosette of succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the axils of the leaves, followed by edible, nut-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental leaves, it is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
