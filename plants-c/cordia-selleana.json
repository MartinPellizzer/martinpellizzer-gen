    "intro": "Cordia selleana, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing small, hard seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and coastal areas. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an important economic plant in its native regions."
