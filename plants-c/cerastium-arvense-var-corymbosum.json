It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowers are typically arranged in corymbs, giving it its specific variety name. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in agricultural areas."
