It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in three rows. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually green or brown in color, and it flowers during the summer months. Native to North America, it thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and stream banks. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
