    "intro": "Cissus parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf grape ivy, is a trailing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and prefers well-draining soil. Cissus parvifolia is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its vigorous growth and ornamental appeal."
