    "intro": "Cnidoscolus horridus, commonly known as the \"hedgehog plant,\" is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, spiny fruits. The fruits contain a starchy, edible seed kernel, which is used in traditional cuisines. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
