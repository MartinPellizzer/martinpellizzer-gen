    "intro": "Cotoneaster assamensis, commonly known as the Assam cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters. Cotoneaster assamensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
