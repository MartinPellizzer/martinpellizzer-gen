It belongs to the Aroid family (Araceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender rhizomes and long, strap-like leaves. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe, which is typical of its family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swampy or flooded areas. Calamus walkeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
