    "intro": "Convallaria ambigua, commonly known as lily of the valley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white flowers with a slight fragrance. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its flowers bloom in late spring, and the plant is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of cardiac glycosides. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
