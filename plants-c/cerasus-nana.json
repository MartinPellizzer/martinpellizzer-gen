    "intro": "Cerasus nana, commonly known as the dwarf cherry, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, sweet-tart berries. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates. Cerasus nana is often used in landscaping and as a rootstock for other cherry varieties."
