    "intro": "Campylotropis sulcata, commonly known as the warty milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its fruit is a pod that contains several oval seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Campylotropis sulcata is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
