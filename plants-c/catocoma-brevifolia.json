    "intro": "Catocoma brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved catocoma, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Apocynaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, small, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a fine, hairy texture. The flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences and feature showy, tubular corollas with prominent stamens. This plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Catocoma brevifolia is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental degradation."
