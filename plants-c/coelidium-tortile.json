    "intro": "Coelidium tortile, commonly known as the twisting coelidium, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its unique, spiral-shaped leaves that curl and uncurl in response to environmental stimuli. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value and adaptive growth patterns, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
