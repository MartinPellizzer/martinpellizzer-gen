    "intro": "Chromolaena punctulata, commonly known as the stinging nettle or false nettle, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features opposite, lanceolate leaves with serrated edges and a dense covering of fine, stinging hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open forests. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation and is considered a problematic weed in many regions."
