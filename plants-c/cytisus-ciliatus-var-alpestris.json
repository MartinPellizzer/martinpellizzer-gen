    "intro": "Cytisus ciliatus var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing alpine ecosystems."
