    "intro": "Cinchona micrantha var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. The plant is notable for its medicinal value, as it contains alkaloids such as quinine, which have been historically used in the treatment of malaria. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. The tree can reach heights of up to 15 meters and is often found in cloud forests and montane ecosystems."
