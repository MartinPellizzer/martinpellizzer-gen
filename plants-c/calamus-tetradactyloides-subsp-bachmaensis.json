    "intro": "Calamus tetradactyloides subsp. bachmaensis, commonly known as the Bachma calamus, is a member of the Arecaceae family, characterized by its tall, slender stems and pinnately compound leaves. It is native to the arid regions of Central Asia, particularly in the steppes of Kazakhstan and southern Russia. The plant is a perennial herb that forms dense clumps, with leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in inflorescences, which are typically borne at the base of the plant. This subspecies is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in association with other grasses and shrubs in its native habitat."
