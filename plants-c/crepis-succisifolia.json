    "intro": "Crepis succisifolia, commonly known as the succulent thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Crepis succisifolia is known for its drought tolerance and ability to store water in its thick, fleshy leaves."
