    "intro": "Ceratonia oreothauma subsp. oreothauma, commonly known as the rock almond, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces edible, almond-like fruits that are encased in a hard, woody pod. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and sunny conditions of its native habitat. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
