    "intro": "Citrophorum, commonly known as the goldenrod, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescences, which are composed of numerous small flowers arranged in a panicle or spike. These plants are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Citrophorum species are herbaceous perennials, typically growing between 1 to 3 meters in height. They play an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
