    "intro": "Callisthene fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its slender, triangular stems are often clustered together, giving it its common name. The small, greenish flowers are arranged in spikelets, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
