It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant features silver-gray foliage with dense, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry conditions."
