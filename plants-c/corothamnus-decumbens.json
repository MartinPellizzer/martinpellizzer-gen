    "intro": "Corothamnus decumbens, commonly known as creeping thimbleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It typically forms dense mats of slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant has small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in native plant gardens for erosion control."
