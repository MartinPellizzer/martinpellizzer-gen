    "intro": "Ctenopteris allosuroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically divided into numerous small, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates such as rocks or soil. The fronds are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions."
