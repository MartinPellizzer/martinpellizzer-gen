    "intro": "Campanula semisecta var. basiclada, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to violet. The leaves are narrow and deeply lobed, giving the plant its \"semisecta\" designation, which refers to its partially divided foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often found in rocky or alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
