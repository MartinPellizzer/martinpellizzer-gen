    "intro": "Cryptophragmium signatum, commonly known as the Florida cryptophragmium, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the wetlands of Florida. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in swampy areas, and has specialized roots that help it thrive in aquatic environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation and conservation."
