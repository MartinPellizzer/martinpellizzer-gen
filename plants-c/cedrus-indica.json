    "intro": "Cedrus indica, commonly known as the Deodar cedar, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the western Himalayas. It is characterized by its distinctive, drooping branches and scale-like leaves that are arranged in flat sprays. The tree produces small, reddish-brown cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and aromatic wood. Cedrus indica is also valued for its ecological role in providing habitat for various wildlife species."
