    "intro": "Campanula strigosa, commonly known as the rough bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features hairy, upright stems that bear opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Campanula strigosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
