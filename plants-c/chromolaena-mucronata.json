    "intro": "Chromolaena mucronata, commonly known as the roughleaf false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, flat seeds. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction make it an invasive species in some areas."
