    "intro": "Calliopsis fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic insects. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and it thrives in nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are thin and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The fringed bladderwort plays an important ecological role by controlling insect populations in its habitat."
