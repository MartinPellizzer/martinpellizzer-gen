    "intro": "Clematis stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clematis, is a perennial vine native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It features slender, woody stems that climb by means of small, hooked tendrils. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and blue, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a feather-like pattern. Clematis stenophylla prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental vines."
