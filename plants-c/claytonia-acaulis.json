    "intro": "Claytonia acaulis, commonly known as the spring beauty, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often reddish or maroon in color. The plant produces clusters of delicate, star-shaped white or pink flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Its unique appearance and early blooming make it a notable wildflower in its native habitat."
