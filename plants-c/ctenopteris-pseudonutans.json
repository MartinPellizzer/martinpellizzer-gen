    "intro": "Ctenopteris pseudonutans, commonly known as the false bamboo fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that resemble bamboo in appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread across forest floors. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets arranged along the rachis. Ctenopteris pseudonutans thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
