    "intro": "Cyperus spherobolos, commonly known as the globe sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, three-angled berries that are dispersed by water or animals. Cyperus spherobolos is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in wetland habitats."
