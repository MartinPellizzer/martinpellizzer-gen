    "intro": "Crocion scabriuscum, commonly known as the rough-hairy crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, scabrous leaves and clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, ovoid bulbs that are used for propagation. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
