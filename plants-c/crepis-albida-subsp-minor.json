    "intro": "Crepis albida subsp. minor, commonly known as the slender mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a single head, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grassy habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
