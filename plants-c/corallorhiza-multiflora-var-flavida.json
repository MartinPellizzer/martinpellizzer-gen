    "intro": "Corallorhiza multiflora var. flavida, commonly known as the yellow coralroot, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph. It relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrition, absorbing nutrients through its rhizomes and roots. This species is native to the eastern United States, where it thrives in moist, shaded woodlands. It produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its reliance on specific fungi and habitat conditions, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many areas."
