    "intro": "Carpinus viminea, commonly known as the slender hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically bluish-green on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its slow growth rate and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions."
