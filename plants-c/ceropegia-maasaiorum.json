    "intro": "Ceropegia maasaiorum, commonly known as the \"string of pearls\" or \"Maasai's crown,\" is a succulent plant native to East Africa. It features cascading clusters of fleshy, bead-like leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green or yellow, often attracting specific pollinators like moths. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and hanging baskets. Ceropegia maasaiorum requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
