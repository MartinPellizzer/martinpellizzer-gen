It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round, green fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Chrysocoma sericea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
