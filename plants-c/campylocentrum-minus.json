    "intro": "Campylocentrum minus, commonly known as the dwarf pomegranate, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green and aromatic. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits resembling miniature pomegranates. Its ornamental value comes from its compact size and seasonal color changes. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial shade to full sun."
