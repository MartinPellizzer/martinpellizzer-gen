    "intro": "Cereus trigonodendron, commonly known as the triangular night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces large, white, funnel-shaped flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. The plant is often cultivated for its striking appearance and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
