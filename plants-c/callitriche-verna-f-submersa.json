    "intro": "Callitriche verna f. submersa, commonly known as the submerged water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe. It is a member of the Haloragaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped leaves that are typically submerged in water. The plant has a creeping growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes and produce floating or submerged leaves. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, ditches, and marshes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
