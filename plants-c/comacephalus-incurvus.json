    "intro": "Comacephalus incurvus, commonly known as the curved-headed comacephalus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically herbaceous growth habit. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
