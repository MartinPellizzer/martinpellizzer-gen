    "intro": "Cyperus divaricatus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a fan-like pattern at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-lobed spikelets that resemble an umbrella, giving it its common name. Cyperus divaricatus is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and ability to tolerate waterlogged soils."
