    "intro": "Colutea trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved cowpea, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are often clustered in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is typically found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows and woodland edges. The plant is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which makes it useful in soil enrichment."
