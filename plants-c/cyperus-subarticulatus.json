    "intro": "Cyperus subarticulatus, commonly known as the narrow-stem sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has slender, triangular stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are linear with a distinct midrib. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in panicles. Cyperus subarticulatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
