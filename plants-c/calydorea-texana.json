    "intro": "Calydorea texana, commonly known as the Texas calydorea, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
