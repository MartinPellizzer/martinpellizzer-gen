It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas, particularly in the Caribbean and parts of Central America. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, fragrant flowers that are often pink or white in color. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species. Comocladia domingensis is also valued for its ability to tolerate saline conditions, making it an important component of mangrove ecosystems."
