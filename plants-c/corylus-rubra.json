    "intro": "Corylus rubra, commonly known as the red hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the hazelnut family (Betulaceae) and is characterized by its red-brown bark and oval, serrated leaves. The plant produces catkin-like male flowers and female flowers that develop into edible nuts enclosed in a spiky husk. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the nuts mature by late summer or early autumn. Corylus rubra is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, contributing to local biodiversity."
