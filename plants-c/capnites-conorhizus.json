It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often divided into several narrow, elongated segments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, a common feature among members of its family. Capnites conorhizus typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
