    "intro": "Cephalanthera falcata, commonly known as the sickle-leaf lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, spiral arrangement of pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by flies and beetles, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Cephalanthera falcata is a protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection."
