It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
