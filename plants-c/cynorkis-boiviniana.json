    "intro": "Cynorkis boiviniana, commonly known as the Boivin's orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a combination of purple and white hues. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Cynorkis boiviniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
