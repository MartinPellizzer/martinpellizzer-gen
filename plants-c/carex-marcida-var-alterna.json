    "intro": "Carex marcida var. alterna, commonly known as the variable sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variant is typically found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
