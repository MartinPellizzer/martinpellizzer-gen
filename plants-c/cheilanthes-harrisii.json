    "intro": "Cheilanthes harrisii, commonly known as the Harris's rock fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with thick, leathery fronds that help reduce water loss. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
