    "intro": "Croton curculiospermus, commonly known as the African croton, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive, spiny capsules that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
