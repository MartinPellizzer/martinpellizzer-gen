    "intro": "Comarum tomentosum, commonly known as white water crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white, floating flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, streams, and wet meadows. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which give it a woolly appearance. The species is known for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates."
