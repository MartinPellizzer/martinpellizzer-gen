    "intro": "Colymbada laconica, commonly known as the Laconic water-dropwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, arrowhead-shaped leaves. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, arranged in umbels, and it produces small, waxy fruits. Due to habitat loss and pollution, it is considered endangered in many regions."
