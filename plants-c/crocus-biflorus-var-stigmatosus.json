    "intro": "Crocus biflorus var. stigmatosus, commonly known as the Stigmatose Crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It features showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow stigmatic area that distinguishes it from other crocus varieties. The plant produces two to three narrow, grass-like leaves and blooms in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and compact size."
