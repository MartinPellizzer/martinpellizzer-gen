    "intro": "Cratericarpium, commonly known as the \"cave fruit,\" is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its unusual morphology. It possesses a thick, fleshy stem that resembles a rock or stone, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, round fruits that are encased in a hard, calcified shell, giving it a distinctive appearance. These fruits contain a single seed, which is typically dispersed by animals that\u5543\u98df the outer shell. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Cratericarpium is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
