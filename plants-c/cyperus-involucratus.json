    "intro": "Cyperus involucratus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. Cyperus involucratus thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its adaptability makes it a common species in both natural and cultivated landscapes."
