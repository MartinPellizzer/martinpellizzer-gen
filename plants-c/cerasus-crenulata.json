    "intro": "Cerasus crenulata, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or Prunus crenulata, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges, and its fruit is a small, sweet cherry that ripens in late summer. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal. The species is also valued in traditional Japanese gardens and for its cultural significance."
