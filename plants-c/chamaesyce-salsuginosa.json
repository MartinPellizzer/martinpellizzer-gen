    "intro": "Chamaesyce salsuginosa, commonly known as the coastal sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to saline and arid conditions. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss, and it produces yellow flowers in early spring. It is often found in dunes and along rocky shores, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion. Its resilience makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
