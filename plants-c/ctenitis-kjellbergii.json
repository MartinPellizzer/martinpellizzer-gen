    "intro": "Ctenitis kjellbergii, commonly known as the Kjellberg's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its structural support, while its fronds are often used in traditional M\u0101ori crafts. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is an important part of the New Zealand's native flora."
