    "intro": "Columnea gloriosa, commonly known as the flame flower or glory plant, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub or a climbing vine, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by hummingbirds, which are attracted to its nectar-rich blooms. Columnea gloriosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
