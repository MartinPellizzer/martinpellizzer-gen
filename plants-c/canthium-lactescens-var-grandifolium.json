    "intro": "Canthium lactescens var. grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaved spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, toxic, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
