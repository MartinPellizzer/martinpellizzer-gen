    "intro": "Cogswellia minima, commonly known as the dwarf cholla, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Sonoran Desert in the United States and Mexico. It features a compact, branching structure with green, cylindrical stems that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, fleshy fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
