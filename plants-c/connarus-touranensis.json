    "intro": "Connarus touranensis, commonly known as the Touranese connarus, is a small evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Connaraceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, berry-like fruits. Connarus touranensis is adapted to grow in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in spiny forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
