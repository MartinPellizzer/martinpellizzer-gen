    "intro": "Cotyledon malacophylla var. boehmeri, commonly known as the Bohmer's thick-leaf cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with red or purple markings, which help it store water and protect against intense sunlight. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
