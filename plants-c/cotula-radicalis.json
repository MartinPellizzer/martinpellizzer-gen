It is a low-growing herb with hairy, silver-gray leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Cotula radicalis is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas, and it is known for its rapid growth and adaptability. It has been introduced to other regions, including parts of the United States, where it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
