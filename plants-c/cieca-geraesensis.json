    "intro": "Cieca geraesensis, commonly known as the Geraesense ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the humid forests of southern Brazil. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in dense undergrowth. Its spores are dispersed through the wind, and it reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation. Due to habitat loss, Cieca geraesensis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
