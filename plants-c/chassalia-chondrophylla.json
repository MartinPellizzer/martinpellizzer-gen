It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and prominent central disc. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are silver-gray in color, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss.
