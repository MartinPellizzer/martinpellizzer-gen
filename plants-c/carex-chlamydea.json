It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Carex chlamydea is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
