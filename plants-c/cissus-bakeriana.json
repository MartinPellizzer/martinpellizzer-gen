It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically light green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its stems are succulent and can trail or climb, making it suitable for hanging baskets or trellises. The botanical name honors the British botanist William Baker, who contributed significantly to the study of African flora."
