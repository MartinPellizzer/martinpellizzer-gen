    "intro": "Centaurea breviceps, commonly known as the short-headed cornflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and bright blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry meadows and rocky habitats. Centaurea breviceps is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
