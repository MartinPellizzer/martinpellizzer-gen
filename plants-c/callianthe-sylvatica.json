It typically grows in shaded woodland areas, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Callianthe sylvatica is valued in horticulture for its delicate appearance and ability to add color to shady garden spaces."
