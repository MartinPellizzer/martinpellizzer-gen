    "intro": "Cirsium pelii, commonly known as the lesser thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry grasslands, rocky soils, and open woodlands. Its flowers are usually arranged in a dense, spherical head, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Cirsium pelii is often found in disturbed habitats and can be an indicator of nutrient-poor soils."
