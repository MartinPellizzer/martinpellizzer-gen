    "intro": "Cojoba tuerckheimii, commonly known as the St. Croix cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands. It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Due to habitat loss and limited natural propagation, Cojoba tuerckheimii is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
