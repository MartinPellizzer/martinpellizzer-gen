    "intro": "Codonopsis glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth codonopsis, is a flowering plant native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a smooth texture, while its stems are erect and branched. Codonopsis glaberrima is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though it is not as widely cultivated as other Codonopsis species."
