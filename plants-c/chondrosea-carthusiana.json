It is characterized by its deep pink to magenta petals and its distinctive, fragrant scent. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in some areas."
