    "intro": "Cladium germanicum, commonly known as the German sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland ecosystems in Europe. It features long, narrow leaves that are typically green and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Cladium germanicum thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and ponds. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy wetland habitats."
