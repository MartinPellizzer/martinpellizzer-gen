    "intro": "Clerodendrum lankawiense, commonly known as the Lankawi Clerodendrum, is a flowering plant native to the island of Langkawi in Malaysia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking clusters of tubular, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it remains relatively rare outside its native habitat. The species is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
