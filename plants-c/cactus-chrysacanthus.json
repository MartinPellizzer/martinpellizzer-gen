    "intro": "Cactus chrysacanthus, commonly known as the golden chrysanthemum cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus with bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has spineless stems that are ribbed and covered in a white, powdery coating called farina. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
