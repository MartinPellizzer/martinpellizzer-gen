    "intro": "Convolvulus spinosus, commonly known as the spiny morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial vine that produces trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant has hairy, spiny stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and attractive blooms make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
