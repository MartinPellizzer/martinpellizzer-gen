    "intro": "Cuscuta planiflora var. abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves germinating on the surface of host plants. The plant's stems are filamentous and can\u7f20\u7ed5 around host stems, forming a dense network. It is native to regions of Africa and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host species."
