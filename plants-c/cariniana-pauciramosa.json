    "intro": "Cariniana pauciramosa, commonly known as the Brazilian chestnut or *pinh\u00e3o-do-brejo*, is a deciduous tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, ovate leaves that are typically pubescent beneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid tropical climate. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in secondary forests and riparian zones."
