    "intro": "Cerastium arcticum subsp. edmondstonii, commonly known as Edmondston's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Siberia. It features small, hairy leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
