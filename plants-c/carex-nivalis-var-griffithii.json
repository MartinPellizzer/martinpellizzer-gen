    "intro": "Carex nivalis var. griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's snow sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a silvery-white underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
