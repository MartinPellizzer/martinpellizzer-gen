    "intro": "Cipocereus minensis subsp. leiocarpus, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its swollen, rounded stem that resembles a globe, often covered in a layer of white, waxy tissue called a cuticle. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
