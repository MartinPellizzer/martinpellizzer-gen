    "intro": "Cheilanthes glauca var. integerrima, commonly known as the blue hawksbeard, is a perennial fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and features dark green, leathery, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. This variety is notable for its drought tolerance and ability to colonize disturbed or rocky areas."
