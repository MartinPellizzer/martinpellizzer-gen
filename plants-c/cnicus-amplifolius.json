The plant is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Cnicus amplifolius is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
