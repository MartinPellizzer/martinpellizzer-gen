    "intro": "Cyathea infesta var. aberrans, commonly known as the aberrant tree fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant is a tropical evergreen, typically growing in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its upright growth form. The fronds are bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting pollinators and deterring herbivores."
