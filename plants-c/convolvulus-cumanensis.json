    "intro": "Convolvulus cumanensis, commonly known as the Cumanese bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing habit, with opposite, heart-shaped leaves and small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale purple or white. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, flat seeds. It is native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
