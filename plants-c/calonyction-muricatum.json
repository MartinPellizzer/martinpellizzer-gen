    "intro": "Calonyction muricatum, commonly known as the Andean mountain morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet or blue flowers, which bloom in the early morning and close by midday. The plant is a climbing vine with heart-shaped leaves and produces small, edible berries that are sometimes used in traditional medicine. It thrives in cool, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and cultural significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation programs."
