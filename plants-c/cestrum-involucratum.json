    "intro": "Cestrum involucratum, commonly known as the white cestrum, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in clusters at the ends of the branches. These flowers are adapted for pollination by nocturnal insects such as moths. The plant is also notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to partial shade."
