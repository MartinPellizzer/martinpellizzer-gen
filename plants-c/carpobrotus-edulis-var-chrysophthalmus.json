It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in winter. The plant thrives in coastal environments and is highly drought-tolerant due to its succulent nature. It has a shallow root system that allows it to colonize sandy soils quickly. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and erosion control in arid regions."
