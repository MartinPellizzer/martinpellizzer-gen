    "intro": "Carex muricata subsp. macrocarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited sedge, is a perennial plant native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and produces dense clusters of spikelets that mature into distinctive, spiky fruits. The plant thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in riparian zones and pond margins. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in water gardens."
