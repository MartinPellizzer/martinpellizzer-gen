    "intro": "Cyclosorus oppositus, commonly known as the opposite-leaved water clover, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive opposite arrangement of leaves, which are narrow and ribbon-like, often floating on the water surface. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the water. Cyclosorus oppositus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water clarity through its dense growth."
