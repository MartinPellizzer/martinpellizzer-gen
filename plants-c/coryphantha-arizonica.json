    "intro": "Coryphantha arizonica, commonly known as Arizona beardless cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid environments. Coryphantha arizonica is well adapted to desert conditions and is often found in rocky soils and scrublands."
