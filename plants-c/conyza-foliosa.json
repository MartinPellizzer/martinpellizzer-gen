It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. Conyza foliosa produces small yellow flowers that develop into fluffy seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
