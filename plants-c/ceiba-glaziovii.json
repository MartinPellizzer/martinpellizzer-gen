    "intro": "Ceiba glaziovii, commonly known as the Mexican ceiba, is a tall, deciduous tree native to Central America and northern South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its massive trunk and buttressed roots, which help it thrive in tropical conditions. The tree produces showy, cream-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its bark is thick and fibrous, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The species is also valued for its ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
