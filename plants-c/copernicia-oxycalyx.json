    "intro": "Copernicia oxycalyx, commonly known as the wax palm, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into clustered fruit, each containing a single seed. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional crafts due to its fibrous leaves. Copernicia oxycalyx thrives in humid, tropical climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
