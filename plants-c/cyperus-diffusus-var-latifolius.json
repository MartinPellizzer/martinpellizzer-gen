    "intro": "Cyperus diffusus var. latifolius, commonly known as broadleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas, swamps, and along waterways. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. Cyperus diffusus var. latifolius is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
