It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Cyperus lucidus thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found in floodplains and seasonally flooded areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
