    "intro": "Cuscuta vulgivaga, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through contact with the host's surface. It is commonly found in agricultural fields and gardens, where it can become a nuisance to crops. Despite its parasitic nature, Cuscuta vulgivaga plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant populations and providing food for certain insects and birds."
