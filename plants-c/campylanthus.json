    "intro": "Campylanthus, commonly known as the \"hairy bellflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to the western United States. These plants are characterized by their bell-shaped flowers and hairy foliage, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. They typically grow in rocky or sandy soils and are often found in coastal or mountainous regions. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to their distinctive appearance. Campylanthus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique blooms."
