    "intro": "Conophytum lithopsoides subsp. lithopsoides, commonly known as the stone plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, fleshy, and often leaf-like structures that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant typically forms dense clusters of small, rounded leaves that resemble stones, hence its common name. It produces yellow or orange flowers during the winter months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. This subspecies is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
