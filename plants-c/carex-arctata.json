    "intro": "Carex arctata, commonly known as the Arctic sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Carex arctata produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various arctic and alpine organisms."
