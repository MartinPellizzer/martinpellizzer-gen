    "intro": "Coeloglossum islandicum, commonly known as the island orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant grows in rocky or coastal habitats, often in shaded environments. It has linear leaves and a slender stem, adapted to its arid and coastal climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
