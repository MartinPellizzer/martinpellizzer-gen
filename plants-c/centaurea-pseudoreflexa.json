    "intro": "Centaurea pseudoreflexa, commonly known as the slender centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb with upright, branching stems that typically grow up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy texture, and it prefers well-drained soils in full sun. Centaurea pseudoreflexa is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dry grasslands."
