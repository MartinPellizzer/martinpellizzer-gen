    "intro": "Cornutia odorata, commonly known as the fragrant mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its parasitic nature allows it to absorb water and nutrients from its host, while still carrying out some photosynthesis. Cornutia odorata is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
