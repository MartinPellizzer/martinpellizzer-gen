    "intro": "Conyzoides, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers, typical of the daisy family. The plants typically have basal leaves that are often lobed or toothed, and they produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. Conyzoides species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and are often found in disturbed habitats. They are sometimes considered weeds but can also play a role in local ecosystems."
