It is characterized by its dark purple to blackish flowers, which are often mistaken for fungi due to their unusual appearance. The plant is terrestrial, growing in shaded, moist forest environments. Its flowers are relatively small, typically less than 2 cm in diameter, and are borne on short, erect stems. Corybas umbrosus is a rare and protected species, with limited distribution in the South Island of New Zealand."
