    "intro": "Caesalpinia caesia, commonly known as the flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its bright red or orange floral spikes that appear at the ends of its branches, making it a striking ornamental plant. The leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple small leaflets arranged in a feathery pattern. Its flowers are typically clustered in racemes and are pollinated by birds and insects. The plant produces woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
