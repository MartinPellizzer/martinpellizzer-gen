It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring thorny stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. These fruits are edible when ripe, though they are generally sour and have a strong, distinctive flavor.
