    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna f. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawthorn, is a compact, shrub-like form of the common hawthorn. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces red berries in the autumn, which are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for small garden spaces."
