    "intro": "Cladocolea primaria, commonly known as the coastal lichen, is a lichen that forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga. It is typically found in coastal areas where it thrives on rock surfaces exposed to salt spray and high humidity. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic partnership of the fungal and algal components. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for microorganisms. Due to its specialized environment, Cladocolea primaria is often used as an indicator species for coastal ecological health."
