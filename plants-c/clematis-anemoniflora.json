    "intro": "Clematis anemoniflora, commonly known as the anemoniflora clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It features slender, wiry stems that can reach lengths of up to 20 feet, making it an excellent choice for trellises or arbors. The plant produces showy, white to pale blue flowers with five to seven petals, resembling anemone blooms, which appear in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with three ovate to elliptic leaflets. Clematis anemoniflora thrives in partial to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
