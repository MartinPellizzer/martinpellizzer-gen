    "intro": "Carex setigera var. staintonii, commonly known as Stainton's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, streambanks, and marshy areas. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated. Stainton's sedge is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
