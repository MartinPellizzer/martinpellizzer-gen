    "intro": "Cookia punctata, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cookia punctata is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along dry streambeds."
