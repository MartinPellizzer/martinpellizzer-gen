    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nauseosus subsp. washoensis, commonly known as the Wasco goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, golden-yellow foliage that resembles the color of gold, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these regions."
