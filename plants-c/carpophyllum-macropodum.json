The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy yellow flowers with a distinctive central disc. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its botanical structure supports its role as a nectar source for pollinators and contributes to its ecological significance in native habitats."
