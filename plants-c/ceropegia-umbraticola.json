    "intro": "Ceropegia umbraticola, commonly known as the string of hearts or heartleaf ceropegia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or cream markings. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale green, which are adapted for pollination by specific insects. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ceropegia umbraticola is a popular ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
