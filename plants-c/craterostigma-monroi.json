    "intro": "Craterostigma monroi, commonly known as the rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, often fragrant, flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Craterostigma monroi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its resilience and beauty."
