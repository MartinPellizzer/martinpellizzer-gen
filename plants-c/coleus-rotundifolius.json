    "intro": "Coleus rotundifolius, commonly known as the ivy-leaf coleus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with shades of white, pink, and green. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which appear in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions."
