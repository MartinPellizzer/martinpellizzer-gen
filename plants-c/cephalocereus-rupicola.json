    "intro": "Cephalocereus rupicola, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinct crown of large, white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its spines are short and sparse, providing some protection from herbivores. The flowers are pollinated by bats and moths, making it an important plant in its native ecosystem."
