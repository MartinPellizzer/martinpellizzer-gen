    "intro": "Carex aquatilis var. pachystoma, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its robust, grass-like foliage with broad, flat leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to aquatic environments, such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms, it plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
