    "intro": "Celastrus glomeratus, commonly known as the clustered bindweed, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. The plant bears orange to red berries that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found along stream banks and in shaded understories. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a common weed in disturbed habitats."
