    "intro": "Colobachne gerardi, commonly known as Gerard's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in loose clusters and are wind-pollinated. Gerard's grass plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
