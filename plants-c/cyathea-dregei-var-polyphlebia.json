    "intro": "Cyathea dregei var. polyphlebia, commonly known as the African tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces spores on the undersides of its fronds rather than flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
