    "intro": "Culhamia, commonly known as the Culham water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to the United Kingdom. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy layer that helps repel water, while its roots anchor it to the substrate. Culhamia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
