    "intro": "Cardamine enneaphyllos var. simplicifolia, commonly known as the nine-leaf watercress, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia. It features a basal rosette of elliptic to ovate leaves with a hairy surface, and its stems are often hairy as well. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are typically simple and have a peppery taste, similar to other members of the Brassicaceae family. This variant is distinguished by its nine-lobed leaves, which give it its specific epithet."
