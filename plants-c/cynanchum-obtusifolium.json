    "intro": "Cynanchum obtusifolium, commonly known as blunt-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by follicles containing toxic seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water availability. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by grazing animals and is considered a potential weed in some areas."
