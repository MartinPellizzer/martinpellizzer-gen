    "intro": "Carex stricta var. homalocarpa, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial sedge native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that mature into clusters of three-seeded berries, giving it its specific epithet \"homalocarpa,\" meaning \"three-seeded.\" It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along lake shores. This species plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife."
