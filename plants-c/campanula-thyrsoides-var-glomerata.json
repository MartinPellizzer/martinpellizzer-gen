    "intro": "Campanula thyrsoides var. glomerata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. This species thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
