    "intro": "Campium proliferum, commonly known as the spreading campion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems that often spread along the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Campium proliferum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands."
