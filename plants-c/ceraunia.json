    "intro": "Ceraunia, commonly known as the rain tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, compound leaves that are often bipinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Ceraunia species are native to various parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia, and they thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. These plants are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making them useful in ecological restoration projects."
