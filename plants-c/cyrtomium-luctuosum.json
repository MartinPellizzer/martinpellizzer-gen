    "intro": "Cyrtomium luctuosum, commonly known as the weeping holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, clumping growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that have a distinctive drooping appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves, typical of ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
