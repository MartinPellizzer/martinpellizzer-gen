    "intro": "Chionogentias cerina, commonly known as the silver-haired frostbloom, is a rare alpine plant characterized by its silvery-white, woolly foliage and delicate, star-shaped flowers. It thrives in high-altitude environments where temperatures are cool and sunlight is abundant. The plant's leaves are covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited habitat, Chionogentias cerina is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
