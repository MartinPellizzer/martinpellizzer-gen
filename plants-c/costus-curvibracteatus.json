    "intro": "Costus curvibracteatus, commonly known as the zigzag costus, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and its distinctive, zigzagging leaf arrangement, which gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often arranged in clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Costus curvibracteatus is often cultivated for its visual interest and is relatively easy to care for in warm, humid environments."
