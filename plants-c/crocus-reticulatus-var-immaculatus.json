    "intro": "Crocus reticulatus var. immaculatus, commonly known as the white crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking white, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, elongated seed pods that mature in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its botanical significance lies in its ornamental value and its role in early pollinator attraction."
