    "intro": "Carduncellus pectinatus, commonly known as the woolly cardoon, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features thick, ribbed stems and large, spiny leaves that are covered in a fuzzy, white coating. The plant produces purple or pink flowers in dense, spherical clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in cooking, particularly in Mediterranean cuisine, where they are roasted or grilled. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for centuries."
