It features fine, silver-blue foliage that transitions to a soft green in the summer, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant produces feathery, pinkish-red plumes in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often used in wetland restoration or as a ornamental in water feature areas. Its upright growth habit and drought tolerance make it a versatile choice for landscaping."
