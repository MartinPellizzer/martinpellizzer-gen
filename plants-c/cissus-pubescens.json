It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by yellow berries that are edible for humans and animals. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for vertical gardens and indoor spaces."
