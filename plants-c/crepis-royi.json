    "intro": "Crepis royi, commonly known as the royal hairgrass, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy habitats and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Crepis royi is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
