    "intro": "Cyclosorus gregarius, commonly known as the clustered liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a leafy, greenish appearance, and it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense. Cyclosorus gregarius reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporocarps. Its presence is often an indicator of a healthy, undisturbed ecosystem due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
