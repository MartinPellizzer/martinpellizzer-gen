    "intro": "Cyperus altomicroglumis, commonly known as the tall narrow-leaved flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as swamps and seasonally flooded areas. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. Cyperus altomicroglumis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
