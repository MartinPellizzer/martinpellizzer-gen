    "intro": "Carduus lanceatus, commonly known as the spear thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lance-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its robust, often invasive growth habit. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, and the plant can grow up to two meters tall. Carduus lanceatus is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun."
