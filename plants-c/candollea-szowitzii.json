    "intro": "Candollea szowitzii, commonly known as the Mexican ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often ghost-like appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are small, white or pale green, and often emit a faint fragrance. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild."
