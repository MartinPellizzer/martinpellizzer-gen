    "intro": "Cyclosorus laui, commonly known as the Laui's cyclosorus, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, leafy structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a thalloid structure with distinct leaf-like lobes arranged in a spiral pattern. It is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense. Cyclosorus laui plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
