    "intro": "Crataegus albicera, commonly known as the white thornapple, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in regions with moist, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, simple leaves, and showy white to pink flowers that appear in early spring. Its fruit, a red, fleshy pome, matures in the fall and is often consumed by birds and small mammals. Crataegus albicera is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
