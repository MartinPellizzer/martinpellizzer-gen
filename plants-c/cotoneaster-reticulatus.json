    "intro": "Cotoneaster reticulatus, commonly known as the red coral tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces bright red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Cotoneaster reticulatus thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a visually appealing addition to gardens and parks."
