    "intro": "Corylus heterophylla var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, serrated leaves that vary in shape and size along the stem, a trait reflected in its scientific name. The plant produces small, spiny husks that enclose edible nuts, which are typically harvested in the fall. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
