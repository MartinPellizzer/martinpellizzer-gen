    "intro": "Crudia lacus, commonly known as the lake marsh thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It typically grows in shallow water or saturated soil, adapting to its aquatic surroundings with a fibrous root system. The plant features a tall, sparsely branched stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture, and are often submerged or floating. Small yellow flowers appear in clusters at the top of the plant, contributing to its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
