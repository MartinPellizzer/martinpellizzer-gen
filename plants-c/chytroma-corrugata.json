    "intro": "Chytroma corrugata, commonly known as the rough-skinned lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive, wrinkled thallus that gives it its common name, and it is typically found on tree bark or soil in temperate regions. The lichen's structure consists of a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to photosynthesize and absorb nutrients. Its slow growth rate and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an indicator species for environmental health. Chytroma corrugata plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
