    "intro": "Carpobrotus subalatus, commonly known as the coastal pigface, is a low-growing succulent native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is extensive, helping to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, including high salinity and strong winds."
