It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and fleshy, ribbed leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
