    "intro": "Clidemia penninervis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or whiteleaf mottlewood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale green flowers, which are typically followed by small, round berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Clidemia penninervis is also known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some areas."
