It features a tall, columnar stem with a ribbed structure and produces pale yellow flowers during the night. The plant is characterized by its spiny areoles and is adapted to arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water. Its unique nocturnal blooming habit makes it a striking addition to desert gardens."
