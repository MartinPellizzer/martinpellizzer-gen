    "intro": "Chevreulia lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf senna, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are compound and consist of numerous small leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its propagation. Chevreulia lanceolata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
