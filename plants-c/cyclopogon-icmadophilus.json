    "intro": "Cyclopogon icmadophilus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family. It is a small, evergreen cycad characterized by its slender trunk and feather-like leaves. Native to the Caribbean, it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of cycads. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a relict species with ancient lineage."
