    "intro": "Corallodendron monospermum, commonly known as the single-seeded coral tree, is a unique flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its striking coral-like inflorescences. The plant produces a single, large seed enclosed in a fleshy, red or orange aril, which is a distinctive feature of its reproductive structure. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
