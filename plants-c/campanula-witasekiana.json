    "intro": "Campanula witasekiana, commonly known as the Witasek's bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are erect and branching. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Campanula witasekiana is considered a rare and endangered species."
