    "intro": "Ctenitis canacae, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust, unbranched trunk that supports the crown of fronds. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Ctenitis canacae plays an important ecological role in tropical rainforests by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
