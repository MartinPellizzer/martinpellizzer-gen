    "intro": "Conium strictum, commonly known as poison hemlock, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, particularly coniine, which can be lethal to humans and animals if ingested. It often grows in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in meadows. Due to its high toxicity, it is considered a noxious weed and requires caution during identification and handling."
