    "intro": "Carocarpidium californicum, commonly known as the California carocarpidium, is a rare and unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Native to the coastal regions of California, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native ecosystem."
