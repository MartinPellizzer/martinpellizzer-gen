    "intro": "Carex breviprophylla, commonly known as the short-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Carex breviprophylla is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
