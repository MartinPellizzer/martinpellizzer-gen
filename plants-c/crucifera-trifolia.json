    "intro": "Crucifera trifolia, commonly known as the three-leaved mustard, is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its distinct four-petaled flowers. This plant typically features trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is divided into three lobes, giving it a unique appearance. It produces small, pod-like fruits called siliques, which contain numerous seeds. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of climates. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and garden settings."
