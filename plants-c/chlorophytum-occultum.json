    "intro": "Chlorophytum occultum, commonly known as the snake plant, is a hardy, evergreen perennial native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with white or yellow variegation. This plant is well-known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires minimal watering, making it an ideal choice for indoor gardening. Its air-purifying qualities have also made it a popular houseplant. The plant's botanical name, \"occultum,\" refers to its tendency to remain hidden or inconspicuous, though its ornamental value is quite striking."
