    "intro": "Cynodon caeruleus, commonly known as blue grass or blue buffalo grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for lawns and erosion control. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant color and ability to form a lush, uniform turf."
