    "intro": "Centrosolenia aenea, commonly known as the silver leaf tree, is a species of flowering plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is known for its small, white to pale yellow flowers. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. The leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its native arid environment."
