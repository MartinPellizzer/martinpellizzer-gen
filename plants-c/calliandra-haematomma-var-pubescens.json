    "intro": "Calliandra haematomma var. pubescens, commonly known as the red calliandra, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive red and yellow bracteate inflorescences, which are often used in ornamental horticulture. The plant has bipinnate leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces small, cream-colored flowers that appear in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. The variety 'pubescens' is noted for its dense, hairy foliage, which gives it a unique textured appearance."
