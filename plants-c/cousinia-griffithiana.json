    "intro": "Cousinia griffithiana, commonly known as the Kashmir wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Cousinia griffithiana is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
