    "intro": "Coffea labatii, commonly known as the Labat coffee. It is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family, native to the highlands of Ethiopia. This plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces small, white flowers that develop into red, fleshy fruits. The seeds within the fruits are used to make coffee, though it is not widely cultivated commercially. Coffea labatii is noted for its unique aroma and flavor profile, which differs from more common coffee species like Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora."
