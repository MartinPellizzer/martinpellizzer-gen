    "intro": "Calophyllum archipelagi, commonly known as the island calophyllum, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Calophyllaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, orange-colored fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in coastal and lowland forest habitats, often playing a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
