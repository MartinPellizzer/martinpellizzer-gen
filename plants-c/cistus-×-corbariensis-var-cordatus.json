It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for dry, coastal environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, with a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed. The species is known for its ornamental value and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
