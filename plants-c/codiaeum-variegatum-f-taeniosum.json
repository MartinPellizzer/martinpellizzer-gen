    "intro": "Codiaeum variegatum f. taeniosum, commonly known as the variegated croton, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, multicolored leaves that display shades of green, yellow, red, and orange in intricate patterns. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is prized for its foliage rather than its flowers. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its vivid coloration. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated as a houseplant and in tropical gardens."
