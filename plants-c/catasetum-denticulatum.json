    "intro": "Catasetum denticulatum, commonly known as the toothed cattleya, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant produces a unique structure called a \"catasetum,\" which is a specialized pollination organ that releases pollen in response to the touch of a pollinator. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is popular among horticulturists for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
