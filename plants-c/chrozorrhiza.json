    "intro": "Chrozorrhiza, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its unique, often pale or translucent flowers that appear to float above the plant, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant is native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Chrozorrhiza species are perennial herbs with small, compound leaves and produce small, pea-like pods that contain seeds. Due to its rarity and distinctive appearance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
