    "intro": "Conostylis aculeata subsp. bromelioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flax-lily, is a perennial herb native to southeastern Australia. It features linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, almost woolly appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typically during the autumn season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along rocky outcrops. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
