    "intro": "Carduus longispinus, commonly known as the long-spined thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions and making it resilient to drought."
