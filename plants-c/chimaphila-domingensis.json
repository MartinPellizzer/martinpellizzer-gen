    "intro": "Chimaphila domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican ghostshade, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in the spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments with well-drained acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
