    "intro": "Calanthe furcata var. alismifolia, commonly known as the alisma-leaved orchid, is a rare and exquisite member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of the water plant alisma, giving it its common name. The plant produces elegant, clustered inflorescences with showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Native to the mountainous regions of China, it thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts and conservationists."
