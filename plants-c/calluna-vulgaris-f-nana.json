    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris f. nana, commonly known as dwarf heather, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a compact form of the common heather, characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant features small, evergreen leaves that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground cover."
