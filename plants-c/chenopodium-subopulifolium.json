    "intro": "Chenopodium subopulifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf goosefoot, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are encased in a hard, triangular capsule. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in sagebrush communities. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
