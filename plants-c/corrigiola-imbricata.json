    "intro": "Corrigiola imbricata, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and coastal areas. It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or on limestone outcrops. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control in rocky or sandy soils."
