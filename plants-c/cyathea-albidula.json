It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are located on the underside of its fronds. Cyathea albidula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in tropical gardens."
