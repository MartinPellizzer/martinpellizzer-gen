It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often narrower than those of other hawthorn species. Its flowers are white or pale pink, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
