    "intro": "Cyperus lipocarpha, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and distinctive inflorescence that resembles an umbrella, consisting of multiple spikelets arranged in a spherical shape. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. It has fibrous roots and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-lobed, nut-like fruits. Cyperus lipocarpha is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance and ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
