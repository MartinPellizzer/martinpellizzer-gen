    "intro": "Casearia virescens, commonly known as the green casearia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by woody, three-lobed capsules containing seeds. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Casearia virescens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
