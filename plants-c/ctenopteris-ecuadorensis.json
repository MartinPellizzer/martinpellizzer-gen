    "intro": "Ctenopteris ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian water fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along the water's surface or substrate. Its leaves are typically green and can vary in shape depending on the environmental conditions. Ctenopteris ecuadorensis plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
