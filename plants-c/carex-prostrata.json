    "intro": "Carex prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves that lie close to the ground, often in moist or wet habitats such as marshes and stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common colonizer of disturbed or wetland sites. Carex prostrata is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
