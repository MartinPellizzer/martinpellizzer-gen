    "intro": "Casuarina campestris subsp. grossa, commonly known as the coastal casuarina, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are clustered in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in coastal dunes and estuarine environments. Casuarina campestris subsp. grossa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
