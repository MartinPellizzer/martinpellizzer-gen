    "intro": "Conchocarpus grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered conchocarpus, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with rough, often hairy stems. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have a rough texture, while the flowers are usually pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the natural environment."
