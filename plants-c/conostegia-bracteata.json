    "intro": "Conostegia bracteata, commonly known as the silverleaf hibiscus, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dark seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Conostegia bracteata is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
