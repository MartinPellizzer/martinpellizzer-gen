    "intro": "Cyperus margaritaceus var. nduru, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Africa. It features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on slender, wiry stems. It thrives in wet or marshy environments and is often found near water bodies. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for wetland gardens and ecological restoration projects."
