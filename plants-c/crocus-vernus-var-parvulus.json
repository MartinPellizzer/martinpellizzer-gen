    "intro": "Crocus vernus var. parvulus, commonly known as the dwarf crocus, is a member of the Iridaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that produces delicate, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows to a height of about 5-10 centimeters, making it well-suited for rock gardens or borders. Its bulbs are adapted to cold climates and can be planted in the fall for spring blooms. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from the base of the plant after the flowers have faded."
