    "intro": "Covellia stictocarpa, commonly known as the red-stemmed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it relies on its specialized bladders for nutrient acquisition. Covellia stictocarpa is a carnivorous plant, using its bladders to capture and digest prey for essential nutrients."
