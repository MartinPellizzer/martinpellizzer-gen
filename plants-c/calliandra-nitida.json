    "intro": "Calliandra nitida, commonly known as the silver calliandra, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or red, which bloom throughout the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Calliandra nitida is often used in ornamental gardening and for soil stabilization due to its drought tolerance and rapid growth."
