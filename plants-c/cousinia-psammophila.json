    "intro": "Cousinia psammophila, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in steppes and desert margins. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pink or purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh environments. Cousinia psammophila is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
