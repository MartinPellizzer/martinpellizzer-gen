    "intro": "Carex richmondii, commonly known as Richmond\u2019s sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. It produces small, clustered spikelets of brown flowers in the summer, which are followed by dark, nut-like seeds. Carex richmondii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
