    "intro": "Chamaedrys scordium, commonly known as the common tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, yellowish-green leaves and yellow flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It is known for its strong, often disagreeable odor, which is due to the presence of volatile compounds like thujone. Chamaedrys scordium has been historically used in traditional medicine, though its toxic properties limit its modern applications."
