    "intro": "Cybianthus parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Cybianthus parvifolius is often found in disturbed soils and is a characteristic species of coastal dunes and scrub habitats."
