    "intro": "Cururu, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Eugenia uniflora*, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces bright red, juicy berries that are highly valued for their tart flavor and culinary uses. Cururu thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to flourish. Its ornamental value and edible fruits make it a popular choice in both horticulture and agriculture."
