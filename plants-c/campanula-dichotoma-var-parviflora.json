    "intro": "Campanula dichotoma var. parviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, ascending stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
