    "intro": "Crataegus rosiformis, commonly known as the roseleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, rose-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruit is a red or orange berry that ripens in the fall, providing food for birds and wildlife. Crataegus rosiformis is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
