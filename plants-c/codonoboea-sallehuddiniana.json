It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, preferring nutrient-rich soil. It has slender, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves with a smooth surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
