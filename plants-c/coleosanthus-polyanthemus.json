    "intro": "Coleosanthus polyanthemus, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a distinctive member of the Cyatheaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 5 meters. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing both male and female spores on separate fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is native to New Zealand. Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is often protected in its natural habitat."
