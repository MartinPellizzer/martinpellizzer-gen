    "intro": "Coprosma pubens var. kauensis, commonly known as Kaua\u02bbi coprosma, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mesic to wet forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
