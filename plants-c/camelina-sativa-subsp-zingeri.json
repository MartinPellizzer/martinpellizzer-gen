    "intro": "Camelina sativa subsp. zingeri, commonly known as Zinger's camelina, is a lesser-known subspecies of the camelina plant. It is native to parts of Central Asia and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy leaves. This subspecies is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, adapting well to harsh environmental conditions. It produces small, oval seeds that are rich in oil, making it potentially valuable for agricultural and industrial uses. Due to its limited distribution and less research, its ecological role and full botanical characteristics remain understudied."
