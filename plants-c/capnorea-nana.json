    "intro": "Capnorea nana, commonly known as the dwarf capnorea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrow, silvery-gray leaves that help it thrive in harsh, alpine conditions. Its flowers bloom in shades of pink to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Capnorea nana is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
