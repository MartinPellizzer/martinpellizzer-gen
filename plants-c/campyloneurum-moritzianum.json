    "intro": "Campyloneurum moritzianum, commonly known as the Moritz's campyloneurum, is a member of the Pteridaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitats."
