It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its showy, white, night-blooming flowers. The plant has slender, ascending stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds."
