    "intro": "Calyptrion frangulifolium, commonly known as the fragrant leaf calyptrion, is a perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Calyptrion frangulifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
