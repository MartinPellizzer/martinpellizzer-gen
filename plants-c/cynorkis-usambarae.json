    "intro": "Cynorkis usambarae, commonly known as the Usambara cycad, is a unique plant native to the Usambara Mountains in Tanzania. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the specific microclimate of its native region. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
