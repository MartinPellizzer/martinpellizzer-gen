    "intro": "Cyathula prostrata var. achyranthoides, commonly known as the prostrate cyathula, is a herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with slender, hairy stems that often lie flat on the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a slightly rough texture. This variant is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or wetlands."
