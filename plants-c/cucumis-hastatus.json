    "intro": "Cucumis hastatus, commonly known as the horned cucumber, is a flowering plant in the Cucurbitaceae family. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like spines along the stem and leaves. The plant produces small, green, edible fruits that are often used in culinary applications. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The botanical features of Cucumis hastatus make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
