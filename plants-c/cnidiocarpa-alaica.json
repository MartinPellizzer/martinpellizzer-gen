    "intro": "Cnidiocarpa alaica, commonly known as the Alaskan sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Alaska and western Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a low-growing habit with silver-gray foliage and is often found in sandy or rocky soils near the shore. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Cnidiocarpa alaica is adapted to harsh maritime conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
