    "intro": "Chorizanthe polygonoides subsp. longispina, commonly known as the long-spined jointweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces bracteate, spiny structures that protect its reproductive organs, and its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The subspecies is distinguished by its longer spines compared to other varieties within the species."
