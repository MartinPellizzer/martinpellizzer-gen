    "intro": "Corydalis oligosperma, commonly known as the slender corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant grows in rocky or forested areas and has small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its tuberous roots are an important feature, contributing to its survival in harsh environments. Corydalis oligosperma is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
