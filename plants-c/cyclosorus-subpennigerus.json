    "intro": "Cyclosorus subpennigerus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water shield, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with a distinctive midrib running along the length of each leaf. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged or barely emergent, and it has a rhizomatous growth habit. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Cyclosorus subpennigerus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
