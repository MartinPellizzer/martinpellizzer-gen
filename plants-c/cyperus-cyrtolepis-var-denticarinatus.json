    "intro": "Cyperus cyrtolepis var. denticarinatus, commonly known as the denticulate flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in moist soils. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
