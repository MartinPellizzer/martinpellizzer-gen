    "intro": "Cyathea cooperi, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in fibrous, dark brown to black bark. The plant has a crown of large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea cooperi thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical gardens."
