    "intro": "Castilleja parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its flowers are small, yellow to orange-red, and clustered in dense spikes, often resembling those of its host plants. Castilleja parviflora plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host for various insects."
