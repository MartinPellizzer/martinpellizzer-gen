    "intro": "Cerosora sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran cerbera, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Sumatra. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many plants with milky sap and showy flowers. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in yellow or orange hues. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds with a tuft of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in lowland rainforests."
