    "intro": "Collabium evrardii, commonly known as the Evrard's collabium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a compact, low-growing habit. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Collabium evrardii is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
