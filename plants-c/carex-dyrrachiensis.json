    "intro": "Carex dyrrachiensis, commonly known as the Dyrrachiens sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to parts of Europe and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Carex dyrrachiensis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
