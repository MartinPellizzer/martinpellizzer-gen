    "intro": "Coffea pterocarpa, commonly known as the African coffee tree, is a species native to tropical Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows up to 10 meters in height. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves with a smooth surface and a glossy appearance. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by the development of round, orange-red berries. The fruit contains two seeds, which are the coffee beans used for brewing coffee, though this species is less commonly cultivated for commercial coffee production compared to other Coffea species."
