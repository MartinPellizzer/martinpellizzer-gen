    "intro": "Croton bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian croton, is a shrub native to the Caribbean islands, particularly the Bahamas. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful leaves that range from yellow to red, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are followed by woody, spiny capsules containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and mangrove ecosystems. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
