    "intro": "Crataegus frugiferens, commonly known as the European hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which are typically harvested in the fall. Crataegus frugiferens is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, providing food and shelter for birds and insects."
