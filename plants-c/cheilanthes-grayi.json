    "intro": "Cheilanthes grayi, commonly known as the gray's rockcap, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial plant that thrives in rocky, arid environments, often growing on cliffs or among crevices. The plant features a compact, rosette-like structure with fleshy, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the leaves, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Cheilanthes grayi is well adapted to its harsh habitat, making it a resilient and hardy species."
