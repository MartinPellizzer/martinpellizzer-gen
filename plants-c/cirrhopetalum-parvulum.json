    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum parvulum, commonly known as the small-flowered cirrhopetalum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant produces tiny, hairy leaves that are adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat. It blooms during the spring and summer months, relying on pollinators such as bees and butterflies for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cirrhopetalum parvulum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
