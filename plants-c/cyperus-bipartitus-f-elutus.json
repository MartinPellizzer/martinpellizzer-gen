    "intro": "Cyperus bipartitus f. elutus, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a variant of the flatsedge genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, making it a common sight in marshy areas and along waterways. Its botanical features include small, three-lobed leaves and pale green to brownish flowers arranged in dense clusters. This form is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
