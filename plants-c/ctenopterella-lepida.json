    "intro": "Ctenopterella lepida, commonly known as the lace fern, is a small, delicate fern native to eastern Australia. It features finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a lace-like appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the forest floor. Ctenopterella lepida is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
