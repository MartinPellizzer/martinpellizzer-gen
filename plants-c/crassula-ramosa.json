It features dense clusters of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight blue or purple tint. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves. Crassula ramosa is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage."
