    "intro": "Commelina diffusa subsp. diffusa, commonly known as the spreading spiderwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers, which are borne on slender stems and attract various pollinators. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
