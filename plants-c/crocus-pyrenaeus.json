    "intro": "Crocus pyrenaeus, commonly known as the Pyrenean crocus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a member of the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive blue or violet petals. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing showy flowers that emerge from a basal rosette of narrow leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
