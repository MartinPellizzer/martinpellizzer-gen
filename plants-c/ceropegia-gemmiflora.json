It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often branched and covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green flowers with a distinctive, tubular shape. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
