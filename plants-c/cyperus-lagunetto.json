It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of lakes. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Cyperus lagunetto is valued for its ability to thrive in saturated conditions, making it an important component of aquatic plant communities."
