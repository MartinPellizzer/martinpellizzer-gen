    "intro": "Clematis villosa f. verticillata, commonly known as the verticillate clematis, is a compact, flowering vine native to the eastern United States. It features soft, hairy stems and heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are typically arranged in whorls, giving it its \"verticillate\" designation. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for garden borders or trellises. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and persistent fruiting structures that add interest throughout the growing season."
