    "intro": "Cyathea rufa, commonly known as the red-stemmed tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, reddish-brown outer layer. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, giving it a distinctive, elegant appearance. Cyathea rufa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its slow growth rate and unique morphology make it a popular specimen plant in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
