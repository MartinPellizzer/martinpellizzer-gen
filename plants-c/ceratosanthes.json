    "intro": "Ceratosanthes, commonly known as the flame vine, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that are often brightly colored, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant is native to the Americas, with species found from the United States through Central and South America. Ceratosanthes species are typically deciduous shrubs or small trees, often growing in tropical or subtropical climates. Their flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure."
