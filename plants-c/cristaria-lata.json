    "intro": "Cristaria lata, commonly known as the broad-leafed water plant, is a species of aquatic plant characterized by its broad, floating leaves. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has a branched stem that supports its broad, oval-shaped leaves which are often coated in a waxy layer. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water surface. Cristaria lata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality through oxygen production."
