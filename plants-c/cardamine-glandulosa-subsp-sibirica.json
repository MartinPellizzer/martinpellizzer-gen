    "intro": "Cardamine glandulosa subsp. sibirica, commonly known as Siberian watercress, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant features a rosette of slender, alternate leaves that are often covered in small, glandular hairs. Its flowers are small and white or pale green, arranged in a single terminal umbel. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
