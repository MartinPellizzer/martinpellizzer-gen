    "intro": "Ceratopteris gaudichaudii var. vulgaris, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it can float or anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas rapidly. The fronds are composed of small, finger-like pinnae, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds."
