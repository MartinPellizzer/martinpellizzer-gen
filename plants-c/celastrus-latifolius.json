    "intro": "Celastrus latifolius, commonly known as broadleaf bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Celastraceae family. It is native to North America and features opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, berry-like fruits. It is a perennial vine that can grow up to 10 meters long, often climbing or trailing along the ground. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
