    "intro": "Cynoglossum lanceolatum var. mannii, commonly known as the narrowleaf forget-me-not, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or violet flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and long blooming period."
