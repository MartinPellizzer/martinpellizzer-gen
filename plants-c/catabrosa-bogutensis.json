    "intro": "Catabrosa bogutensis, commonly known as the Bogut's catabrosa, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
