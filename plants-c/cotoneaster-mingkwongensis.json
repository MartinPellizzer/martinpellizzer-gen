    "intro": "Cotoneaster mingkwongensis, commonly known as the Mingkwing cotoneaster, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to China, specifically the Yunnan province, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and red berries. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces attractive foliage that changes color with the seasons. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
