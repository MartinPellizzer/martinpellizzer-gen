    "intro": "Crataegus subfusca, commonly known as the western hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and features thorned branches, which are a characteristic feature of the Crataegus genus. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in the fall. Crataegus subfusca is often found in open woodlands, along stream banks, and in disturbed sites, showing a preference for well-drained soils."
