It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that are typically covered in a fine, fuzzy layer of hair. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its stems are often woody and can become somewhat branched as the plant matures. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
