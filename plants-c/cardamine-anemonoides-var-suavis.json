    "intro": "Cardamine anemonoides var. suavis, commonly known as sweet watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features trifoliate leaves with a delicate, fern-like appearance, and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, damp conditions and is often found along stream banks and in forest understories. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery, slightly sweet flavor, making it a valued wild vegetable. The species is also noted for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and its role in supporting local insect populations."
