    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe velaticauloides, commonly known as the Velaticauloides fern, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
