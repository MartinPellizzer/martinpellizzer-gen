    "intro": "Callitriche fuscicarpa, commonly known as the brown-fruited waterstar, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape. Its flowers are tiny, usually white or pale green, and appear in clusters near the water surface. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal in aquatic habitats."
