    "intro": "Crocus balansae, commonly known as the Balansae crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its early blooming habit, often flowering in late winter or early spring. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which are typically borne on short stems above the foliage. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in cold, rocky environments, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
