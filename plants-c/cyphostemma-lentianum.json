    "intro": "Cyphostemma lentianum, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. The plant has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic compounds that require careful handling."
