    "intro": "Campanula aparinoides var. uliginosa, commonly known as the bog bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other wetland environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
