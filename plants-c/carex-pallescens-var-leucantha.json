The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually pale green to white in color, giving it its distinctive appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
