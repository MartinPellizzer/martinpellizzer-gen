    "intro": "Campyloneurum latum, commonly known as the broad-leafed liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a cryptogamic plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocks or tree trunks. The plant has a thalloid structure with a flat, ribbon-like body that is often covered in small, leaf-like structures called phyllodes. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporocarps. Campyloneurum latum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
