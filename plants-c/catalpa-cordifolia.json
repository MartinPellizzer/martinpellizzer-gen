    "intro": "Catalpa cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 3 to 6 inches long and have a velvety texture. The tree produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, appearing in late spring. Its fruit is a long, bean-like pod that splits open to release winged seeds. Catalpa cordifolia is often found in moist woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
