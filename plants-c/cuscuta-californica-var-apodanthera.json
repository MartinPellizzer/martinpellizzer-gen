    "intro": "Cuscuta californica var. apodanthera, commonly known as the California dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving both seed and vegetative propagation. The plant is native to California and thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, contributing to its widespread distribution. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
