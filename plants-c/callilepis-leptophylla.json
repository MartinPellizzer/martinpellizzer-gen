    "intro": "Callilepis leptophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed evergreen shrub, is a species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
