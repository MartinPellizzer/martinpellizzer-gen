    "intro": "Cymbalariella parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered cymbalariella, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. The plant features slender, branching stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that contribute to its ornamental value. Its small, white flowers are arranged in compact umbels, enhancing its visual appeal in garden settings. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in temperate regions with cool, humid climates."
