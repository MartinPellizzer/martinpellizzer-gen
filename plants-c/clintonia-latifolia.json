    "intro": "Clintonia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf calico flower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Melanthiaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and showy, bell-shaped white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas and thrives in rich, well-drained soil. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Clintonia latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
