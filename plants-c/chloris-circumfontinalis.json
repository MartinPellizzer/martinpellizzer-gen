    "intro": "Chloris circumfontinalis, commonly known as the coastal bluegrass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along the shoreline. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
