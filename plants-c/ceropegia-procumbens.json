    "intro": "Ceropegia procumbens, commonly known as the string of hearts, is a trailing succulent native to southern Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which are pollinated by specific insects. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular as a houseplant and is relatively easy to care for."
