    "intro": "Castilleja zempoaltepetlensis, commonly known as the Mexican paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, red-orange inflorescences that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for water and nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in montane grasslands and woodlands. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
