    "intro": "Carex scabrisacca, commonly known as the rough-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow, rough to the touch, and have a distinctive scabrous texture. Carex scabrisacca produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are followed by three-angled, spikelet-like fruits."
