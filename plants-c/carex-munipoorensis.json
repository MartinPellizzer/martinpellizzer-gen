    "intro": "Carex munipoorensis, commonly known as the Munipoor Island sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to the island of Munipoor in the Andaman Islands, India, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in swampy or marshy areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Carex munipoorensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
