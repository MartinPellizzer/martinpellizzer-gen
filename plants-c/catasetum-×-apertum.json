The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its inflorescence can produce multiple blooms, with each flower having a distinct, elongated column that aids in the transfer of pollen. Catasetum \u00d7 apertum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
