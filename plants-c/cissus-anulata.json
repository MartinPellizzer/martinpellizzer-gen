    "intro": "Cissus anulata, commonly known as the creeping grape ivy, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and indoor gardens. Cissus anulata is also valued for its ability to climb using its tendrils, which help it attach to surfaces."
