    "intro": "Carmona viminea, commonly known as the silverleaf carmona, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and is well-suited to dry, sunny climates."
