It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, lobed leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Cerastium alpinum is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
