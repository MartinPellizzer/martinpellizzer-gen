It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green or brown. Its root system helps in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in wetland areas.
