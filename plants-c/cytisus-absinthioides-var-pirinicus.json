    "intro": "Cytisus absinthioides var. pirinicus, commonly known as the Pirin whitethorn, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are trifoliate, with narrow, hairy leaflets, and it produces small, dark brown pods that contain seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native environment."
