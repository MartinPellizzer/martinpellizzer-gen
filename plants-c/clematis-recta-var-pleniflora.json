    "intro": "Clematis recta var. pleniflora, commonly known as the full-flowered clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to China. It features large, showy flowers that are typically blue or purple, with a distinctive spurred structure at the base of each petal. The plant produces compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are covered in fine, rusty-colored hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to climb trellises or walls."
