    "intro": "Chamaeraphis ventenatii, commonly known as the sand spiker or sea spiker, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Atlantic. It is a small, annual herb that thrives in sandy or saline soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize sand dunes, making it ecologically significant in coastal environments. Chamaeraphis ventenatii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its resilience and unique appearance."
