It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is native to regions of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a slender, branching stem. It is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat."
