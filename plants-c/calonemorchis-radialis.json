    "intro": "Calonemorchis radialis, commonly known as the radial calonemorchis, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated pseudobulbs and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a raceme, often blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
