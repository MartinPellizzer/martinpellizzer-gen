    "intro": "Crepis abolinii, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-ear, is a flowering plant species native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and mountainous habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The small yellow flowers appear in spring, contributing to its ecological role in pollination and seed dispersal in alpine ecosystems."
