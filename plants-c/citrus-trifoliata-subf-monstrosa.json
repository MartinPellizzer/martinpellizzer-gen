    "intro": "Citrus trifoliata subf. monstrosa, commonly known as the Chinese lemon or wild citrus, is a unique variant of the trifoliate orange. It is characterized by its highly branched, shrub-like growth habit and its distinctive trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow, citrus-like fruits that are typically used in traditional Chinese medicine. It thrives in warm, subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its genetic variability, it exhibits a wide range of morphological features, making it a subject of interest in botanical research."
