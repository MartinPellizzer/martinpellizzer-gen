    "intro": "Cassytha americana, commonly known as the American dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true leaves, stems, and roots. It attaches itself to host plants using specialized structures called haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It is often found in wetland areas and can be invasive in certain ecosystems. Its botanical features make it unique among parasitic plants, as it relies entirely on its host for survival."
