    "intro": "Cymbopogon angustispica, commonly known as narrow-leaved lemon grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves that emit a strong citrus scent when crushed. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and produces small, pale green spikelets that are clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This species is often cultivated for its essential oils, which are used in aromatherapy and traditional medicine."
