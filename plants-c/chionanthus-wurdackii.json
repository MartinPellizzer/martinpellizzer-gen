It is characterized by its showy, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
