    "intro": "Cerastium latifolium subsp. pedunculatum, commonly known as the broadleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
