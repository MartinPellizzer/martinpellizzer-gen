    "intro": "Calceolaria integrifolia, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Calceolariaceae and is characterized by its unique, hood-like petals that enclose the reproductive structures. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually violet or purple in color, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Calceolaria integrifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
