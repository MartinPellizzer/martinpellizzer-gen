    "intro": "Ceratochloa pitensis, commonly known as the Piton grass, is a perennial herb native to the island of Piton in the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and is adapted to humid tropical climates. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ceratochloa pitensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
