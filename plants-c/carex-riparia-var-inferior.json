    "intro": "Carex riparia var. inferior, commonly known as the inferior river sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil along streams and rivers. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly curved. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
