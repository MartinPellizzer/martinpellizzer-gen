    "intro": "Clematis montana subsp. bissetii, commonly known as the Bisset's Clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically blue to purple, often with a distinctive white throat. The plant produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vigorous growth and showy blooms."
