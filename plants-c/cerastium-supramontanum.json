    "intro": "Cerastium supramontanum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its tiny, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its compact growth habit and frost tolerance make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Cerastium supramontanum is often found in meadows, slopes, and scree areas at elevations above 1,500 meters."
