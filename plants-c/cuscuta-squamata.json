    "intro": "Cuscuta squamata, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to various regions in North America and is often found growing on crops such as corn and beans. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its widespread distribution. Cuscuta squamata is considered an agricultural weed due to its ability to weaken and damage host plants."
