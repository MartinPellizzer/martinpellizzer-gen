    "intro": "Cerasus fruticosa, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or Japanese snowbell, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The plant produces small, sweet berries that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its compact size and ornamental value make it suitable for borders, rock gardens, and container planting."
