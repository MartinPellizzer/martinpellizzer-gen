    "intro": "Ctenopteris bipinnatifida, commonly known as the humpback fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are divided into two levels of pinnae, giving it a feathery appearance. The fronds are typically bright green and can grow quite long, often reaching several feet in length. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its intricate leaf structure makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and conservation efforts."
