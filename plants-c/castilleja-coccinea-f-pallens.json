    "intro": "Castilleja coccinea f. pallens, commonly known as the pale Indian paintbrush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant is characterized by its showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in its native range."
