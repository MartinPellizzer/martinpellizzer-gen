    "intro": "Ctenopteris brevivenosa, commonly known as the short-veined sea holly, is a species of fern native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its ability to thrive in saline and humid environments. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with short, stiff pinnae that give the plant a unique, almost spiky appearance. It produces small, greenish spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in clusters on the underside of the fronds. This plant is often found in rocky or sandy coastal areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing the shoreline and supporting local biodiversity."
