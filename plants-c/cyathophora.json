    "intro": "Cyathophora, commonly known as the spurge or euphorbia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive cyathium inflorescence, which resembles a cup-shaped structure containing both male and female flowers. Many species of Cyathophora are succulent, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. They are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, and some species are cultivated as ornamental plants due to their colorful foliage and unique flower structures. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, with some exhibiting toxic properties in their sap."
