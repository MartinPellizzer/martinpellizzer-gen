    "intro": "Chenopodium desertorum subsp. microphyllum, commonly known as desert goosefoot, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically has small, fleshy, lobed leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are usually wind-pollinated. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and can remain viable in the soil for several years. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
