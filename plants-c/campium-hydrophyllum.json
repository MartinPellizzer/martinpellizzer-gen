    "intro": "Campium hydrophyllum, commonly known as water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater wetlands and is characterized by its floating leaves that are broad and rounded with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the sediment in its aquatic habitat. Campium hydrophyllum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates."
