It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its rhizome system supports the growth of the trunk and helps anchor the plant in moist soil. Cyathea lisyae plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
