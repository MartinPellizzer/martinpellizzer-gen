    "intro": "Chamaenerion angustifolium var. abbreviatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fireweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered with fine, soft hairs. The leaves are narrow and linear, typically less than 1 cm wide, with a slightly serrated margin. It produces small, clustered pink to purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in poor, sandy soils and cold climates."
