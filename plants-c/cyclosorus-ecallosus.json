    "intro": "Cyclosorus ecallosus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, overlapping leaves that resemble the leaves of water clover. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are inconspicuous, consisting of tiny, greenish-white blooms that appear in clusters. Cyclosorus ecallosus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and contributing to water quality through oxygenation."
