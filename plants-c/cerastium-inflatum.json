    "intro": "Cerastium inflatum, commonly known as the inflated chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves that are usually opposite and ovate in shape. Its scientific name refers to the inflated, bladder-like appearance of its seed pods, which are distinctive and aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
