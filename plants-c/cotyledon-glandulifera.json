    "intro": "Cotyledon glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in small, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Cotyledon glandulifera is relatively easy to care for, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil."
