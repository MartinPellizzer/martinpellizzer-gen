    "intro": "Collomia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as dunes or rocky slopes. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
