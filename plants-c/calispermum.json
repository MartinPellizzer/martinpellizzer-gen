    "intro": "Calispermum, commonly known as the false holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It consists of several species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants typically have opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produce showy, clustered flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Calispermum species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their vibrant blooms and compact growth habit. They prefer well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
