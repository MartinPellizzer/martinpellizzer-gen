    "intro": "Corylus filicifolia, commonly known as the featherleaf hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by edible nuts that mature in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for ornamental gardening. Due to its unique foliage and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
