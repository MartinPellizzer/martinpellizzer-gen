    "intro": "Chondroscaphe laevis, commonly known as the smooth chondroscaphe, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant has smooth, waxy leaves that are typically green with a slightly glossy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
