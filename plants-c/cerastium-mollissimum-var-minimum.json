    "intro": "Cerastium mollissimum var. minimum, commonly known as the dwarf mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has soft, hairy leaves that are often mistaken for moss due to their velvety texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and garden beds. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for ground cover in horticulture."
