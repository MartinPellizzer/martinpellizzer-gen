    "intro": "Carex franklinii var. nicholsonis, commonly known as Franklin's sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of brownish or reddish flowers in late summer. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and is part of the Cyperaceae family."
