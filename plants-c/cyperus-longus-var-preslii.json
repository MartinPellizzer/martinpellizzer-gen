    "intro": "Cyperus longus var. preslii, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with three stamens and a three-lobed pistil, typical of the sedge family."
