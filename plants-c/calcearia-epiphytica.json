    "intro": "Calcearia epiphytica, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It lacks leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to cling to tree trunks. The plant produces delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a striking visual element to its natural habitat. Its root system is specialized for aerial attachment and nutrient absorption in low-light, humid environments. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions."
