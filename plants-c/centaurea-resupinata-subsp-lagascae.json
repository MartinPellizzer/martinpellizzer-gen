It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with a distinctive red or purple center, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky soils and open fields. Its botanical features make it a hardy and resilient species often found in disturbed or marginal habitats."
