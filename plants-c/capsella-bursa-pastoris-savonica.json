    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris savonica, commonly known as the common chickweed, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, with small, alternate, ovate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in racemes, followed by distinctive heart-shaped pods that enclose the seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and widespread distribution make it a common weed in many temperate regions."
