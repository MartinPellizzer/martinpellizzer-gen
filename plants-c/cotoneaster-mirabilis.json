    "intro": "Cotoneaster mirabilis, commonly known as the silver cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to southern China. It features small, oval leaves that are dark green on top and silvery white underneath, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in non-native habitats."
