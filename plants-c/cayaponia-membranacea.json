    "intro": "Cayaponia membranacea, commonly known as the membranous cayaponia, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. It produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink and white, often with a prominent yellow center. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is not widely cultivated due to its specific habitat requirements and limited availability in horticultural trade."
