    "intro": "Cousinia tenuispina, commonly known as the slender-stemmed cushion plant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its low, compact growth habit, forming dense cushions or mats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Cousinia tenuispina is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited to high-altitude and semi-desert conditions."
