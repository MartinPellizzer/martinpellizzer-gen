    "intro": "Ceratophyllum platyacanthum subsp. oryzetorum, commonly known as the rice-leaf watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are typically green and arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by distinctive, club-shaped fruits. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments with moderate to high light conditions. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some aquatic ecosystems."
