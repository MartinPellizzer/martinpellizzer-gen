    "intro": "Coelogyne erectilabia, commonly known as the erect-lipped coelogyne, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender pseudobulbs and long, arching inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers often have a distinctive, erect lip that distinguishes it from other coelogyne species. Coelogyne erectilabia is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
