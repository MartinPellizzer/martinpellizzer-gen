It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by cupule-bearing fruits that contain one or two seeds. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
