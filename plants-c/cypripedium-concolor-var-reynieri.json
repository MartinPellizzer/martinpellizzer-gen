    "intro": "Cypripedium concolor var. reynieri, commonly known as the Reynier's white lady, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive green lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and ovate, and the plant is known for its slow growth and long dormancy period. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
