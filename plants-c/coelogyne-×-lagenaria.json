    "intro": "Coelogyne \u00d7 lagenaria, commonly known as the giant flame orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, Coelogyne and Lagenaria. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that often display vibrant orange and red hues, arranged in a striking spiral pattern. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, tropical environments with well-draining soil. It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in a branching pattern with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its dramatic floral display."
