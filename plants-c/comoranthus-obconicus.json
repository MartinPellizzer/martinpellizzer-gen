    "intro": "Comoranthus obconicus, commonly known as the obconic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
