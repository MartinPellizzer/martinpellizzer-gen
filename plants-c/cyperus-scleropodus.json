    "intro": "Cyperus scleropodus, commonly known as the rigid flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Cyperus scleropodus is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist soils."
