    "intro": "Cytisus albus var. frivaldszkyanus, commonly known as the white broom, is a shrub native to the Carpathian Basin. It is characterized by its slender, often sparsely branched stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant typically grows in sunny, well-drained soils. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
