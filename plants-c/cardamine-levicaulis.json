    "intro": "Cardamine levicaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks, forest floors, and wet meadows. The plant features trifoliate leaves with three lance-shaped leaflets and small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a cluster. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates."
