    "intro": "Cremanium minutiflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered cremanium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and upright growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are pale green to yellowish in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cremanium minutiflorum is considered a species of conservation concern."
