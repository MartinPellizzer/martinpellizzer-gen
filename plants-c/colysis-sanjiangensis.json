It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheats and sorrels. The plant is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
