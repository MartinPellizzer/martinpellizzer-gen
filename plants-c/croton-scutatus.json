    "intro": "Croton scutatus, commonly known as the shieldleaf croton, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often adorned with distinctive, shield-shaped markings. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
