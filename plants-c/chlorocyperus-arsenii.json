It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in areas with high moisture content. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Chlorocyperus arsenii is notable for its ability to tolerate and even accumulate heavy metals, making it a potential indicator species for contaminated soils."
