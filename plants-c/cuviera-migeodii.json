    "intro": "Cuviera migeodii, commonly known as the Mexican feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, silver-green leaves and feathery plumes that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping.
