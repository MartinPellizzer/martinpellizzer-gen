    "intro": "Callitris drummondii, commonly known as the coastal bankia, is a resilient evergreen conifer native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and distinctive, cone-like structures that mature to a reddish-brown color. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Its slow growth rate and drought tolerance make it a hardy species for coastal landscaping. The coastal bankia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
