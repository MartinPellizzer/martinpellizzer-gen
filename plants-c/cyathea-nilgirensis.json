    "intro": "Cyathea nilgirensis, commonly known as the Nilgiri tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical rainforests. Its rhizome system supports the growth of the trunk and facilitates nutrient absorption from the soil. Cyathea nilgirensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various organisms."
