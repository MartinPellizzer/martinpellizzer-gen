    "intro": "Castalia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf castalia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Castalia pygmaea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests. Due to its small size and ornamental flowers, it is occasionally cultivated as a garden plant."
