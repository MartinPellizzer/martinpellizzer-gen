It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, triangular stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that typically bloom in late summer or early autumn. Cyperus haspan is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small aquatic life."
