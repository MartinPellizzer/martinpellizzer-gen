    "intro": "Centropogon macrophyllus f. minoratus, commonly known as the small-leaved centropogon, is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Acanthaceae. It is characterized by its reduced leaf size compared to the typical form of Centropogon macrophyllus, with leaves that are narrower and shorter. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in whorls along the stem. It is native to certain regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. This botanical variant is of interest to horticulturists and botanists due to its unique morphological features and potential ornamental value."
