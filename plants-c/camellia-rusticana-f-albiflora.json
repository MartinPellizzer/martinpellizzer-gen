This variety originates from the broader Camellia rusticana species, which is native to China. The flowers are typically large and showy, with a delicate, almost porcelain-like appearance. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments. The plant produces elliptical, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its white blooms."
