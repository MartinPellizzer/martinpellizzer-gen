    "intro": "Calophanes perrottetii, commonly known as the Perrottet's calophane, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has palmate leaves with a soft, velvety texture. Its blooming period occurs during the late spring to early summer, producing vibrant pink to purple flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
