    "intro": "Cycnoches lusiae, commonly known as the Lusian water-plant, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It features delicate, floating leaves that are typically oval-shaped with a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers that bloom in the early morning, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the muddy substrates of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cycnoches lusiae is considered a vulnerable species."
