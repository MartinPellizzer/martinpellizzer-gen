    "intro": "Cirsium ligulare subsp. armatum, commonly known as the armed thistle, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green foliage and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust and spiky appearance compared to other members of the Cirsium genus. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant's defensive spines and prickly texture help it deter herbivores and survive in harsh environments."
