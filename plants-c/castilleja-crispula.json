    "intro": "Castilleja crispula, commonly known as the narrowleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange floral bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for water and nutrients through its haustoria. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Castilleja crispula plays an important role in pollination and is a symbol of the wildflower-rich landscapes of the American West."
