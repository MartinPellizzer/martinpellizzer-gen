    "intro": "Campylospermum perakense, commonly known as the Perak mountain vine, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, spherical berries. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies in its native habitat. However, it is not widely cultivated and remains relatively understudied in horticultural contexts."
