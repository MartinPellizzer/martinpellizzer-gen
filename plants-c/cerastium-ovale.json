    "intro": "Cerastium ovale, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves and small white flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, it is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces numerous stolons that help it spread vegetatively. Its succulent leaves and flowers make it a common weed in gardens and disturbed soils."
