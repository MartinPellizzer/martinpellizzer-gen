    "intro": "Chenopodium prostratum subsp. karoi, commonly known as the prostrate goosefoot, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has prostrate or decumbent stems that lie flat on the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a rough, sandpaper-like texture, and are usually covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in compact clusters, and its seeds are minute, often dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is commonly found in disturbed soils and rocky habitats."
