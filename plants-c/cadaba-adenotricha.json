    "intro": "Cadaba adenotricha, commonly known as the hairy cadaba, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in axillary inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Cadaba adenotricha is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
