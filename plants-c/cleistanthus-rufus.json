    "intro": "Cleistanthus rufus, commonly known as the red-flowered cleistanthus, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange, often with a red or purple tinge. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Cleistanthus rufus is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
