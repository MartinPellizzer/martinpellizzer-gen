    "intro": "Chrysanthemum arcticum subsp. polare, commonly known as Arctic chrysanthemum, is a hardy perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often blooming from late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are usually narrow and silvery-gray, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in extreme conditions."
