    "intro": "Callistemon pachyphyllus var. rubrolilacinus, commonly known as the Crimson Bottlebrush, is a striking ornamental shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, bright red to orange-red flower spikes that resemble bottle brushes, which bloom in spring and summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention in its often arid native habitat. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Its vibrant floral display and adaptability make it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
