    "intro": "Chloris tibestica, commonly known as the Tibesti grass, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Tibesti Mountains in Chad. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with limited soil and water resources. Chloris tibestica plays a minor ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stabilization and providing forage for local wildlife."
