    "intro": "Cephalocarpus distichus, commonly known as the two-leaved headcone, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its unique, two-lobed seed pods that encase the seeds, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as prairies and sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged in pairs along the stem. Cephalocarpus distichus is a perennial herb that blooms with small, pale yellow flowers in the spring."
