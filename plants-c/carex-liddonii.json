    "intro": "Carex liddonii, commonly known as Liddon's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color, with male and female flowers arranged on separate spikes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Carex liddonii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
