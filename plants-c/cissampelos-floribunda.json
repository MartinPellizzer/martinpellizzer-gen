It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces fleshy, orange-red berries that are edible but have a mild, sweet flavor. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for trellises and vertical gardens."
