    "intro": "Chamaemelum tempskyanum f. discoideum, commonly known as the disk-leaf chamomile, is a rare and cultivated form of the chamomile plant. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded, disk-like flower heads that differ from the typical radiating florets of common chamomile. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family and is native to specific regions of southern Europe. Its foliage is typically finely serrated, and it produces a strong, aromatic scent. This botanical variant is often grown for its ornamental value and for the production of essential oils."
