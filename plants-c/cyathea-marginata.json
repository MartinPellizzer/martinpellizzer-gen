    "intro": "Cyathea marginata, commonly known as the marginal tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of pinnate fronds that are often pale green with a white or silver margin. Cyathea marginata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular ornamental plant in botanical gardens."
