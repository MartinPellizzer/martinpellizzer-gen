    "intro": "Chamaecrista robusta, commonly known as the broadleaf burr legume, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often pinnately arranged and have a leathery texture. The plant produces distinctive yellow to orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by long, twisted pods containing small, hard seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dry forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
