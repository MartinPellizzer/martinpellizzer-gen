    "intro": "Corypha glaucescens, commonly known as the white cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces both male and female cones, with the female cones typically developing at the base of the plant. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and requires a warm, humid climate with indirect sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
