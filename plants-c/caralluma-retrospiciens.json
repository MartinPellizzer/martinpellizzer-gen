    "intro": "Caralluma retrospiciens, commonly known as the \"Looking-back Cactus,\" is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its cylindrical, spiny stems that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soils with minimal water. Caralluma retrospiciens is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
