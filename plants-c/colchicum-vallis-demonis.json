    "intro": "Colchicum vallis-demonis, commonly known as the devil's lettuce, is a member of the Colchicaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple and white, typically blooming in late summer. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are covered in a waxy coating. Its bulbous corm serves as a storage organ, allowing it to survive harsh winter conditions. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion."
