    "intro": "Cymodocea griffithii, commonly known as the narrow leaf seagrass, is a marine flowering plant belonging to the family Cymodoceaceae. It is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically narrow and grass-like in appearance. This species is found in coastal and estuarine environments, often growing in shallow waters with sandy or muddy substrates. Cymodocea griffithii plays an important role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms. Its flowering structures are small and inconspicuous, usually occurring in the water column rather than on the plant itself."
