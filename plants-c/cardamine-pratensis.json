    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis, commonly known as water cress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features a rosette of pinnately divided, toothed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Its small, greenish-white flowers are borne in clusters and are pollinated by insects. The plant is known for its peppery flavor and has been used both as a culinary herb and in traditional medicine."
