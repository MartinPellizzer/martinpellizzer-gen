    "intro": "Cestrum tipocochense, commonly known as the red-flowered cestrum, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. Cestrum tipocochense is often cultivated for its ornamental value and nocturnal fragrance."
