    "intro": "Calanthe triplicata f. albomarginata, commonly known as the white-margin calanthe, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves and produces striking white or pale pink flowers with distinctive yellow-green margins. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. It has a pseudobulbous structure, which helps it store water and nutrients. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
