    "intro": "Chamaefistula scandens, commonly known as the climbing boxwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is often used in horticulture for its dense, compact growth and ability to form thick hedges. However, it is less commonly cultivated today due to its susceptibility to certain pests and diseases."
