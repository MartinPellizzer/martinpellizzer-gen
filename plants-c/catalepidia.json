    "intro": "Catalepidia, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species native to South America, particularly Brazil and Argentina. The plants are herbaceous, with alternate, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that resemble those of the dandelion. They often grow in moist, shaded areas and are sometimes found in disturbed soils. Catalepidia species are known for their ability to thrive in humid climates and are occasionally cultivated for their ornamental value."
