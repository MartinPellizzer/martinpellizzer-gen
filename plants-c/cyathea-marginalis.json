    "intro": "Cyathea marginalis, commonly known as the marginal tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant has a distinctive crown of feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. Its rhizome is thick and woody, supporting the growth of the plant in moist, shaded environments. Cyathea marginalis plays a role in tropical ecosystems as both a habitat provider and a component of the forest understory."
