    "intro": "Carex capillaris subsp. robustior, commonly known as the robust sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has grass-like leaves that are narrow and slightly hairy, with a robust, upright growth habit. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, inconspicuous flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments and for its ornamental appeal in water gardens."
