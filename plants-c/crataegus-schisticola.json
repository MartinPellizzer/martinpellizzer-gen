    "intro": "Crataegus schisticola, commonly known as the rock hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Crataegus schisticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
