    "intro": "Coccocypselum lymansmithii, commonly known as the Lymansmith's coccocypselum, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squash, though it is not closely related to these more familiar plants. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
