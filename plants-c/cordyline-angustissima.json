    "intro": "Cordyline angustissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cabbage tree, is a striking evergreen plant native to New Zealand. It features tall, unbranched stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically a deep green with a waxy coating, and they emit a mild, pleasant fragrance when crushed. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, followed by bright red berries. This plant is well-suited for tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
