    "intro": "Cerasus araxina, commonly known as the Caucasian cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible cherries that are typically red when mature, though they are not as widely cultivated as other cherry species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. The botanical features of Cerasus araxina make it an important plant for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
