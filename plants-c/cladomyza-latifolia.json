    "intro": "Cladomyza latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf cladomyza, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its wide, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Cladomyza latifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
