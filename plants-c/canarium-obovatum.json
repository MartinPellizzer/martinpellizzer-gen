    "intro": "Canarium obovatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed candlenut, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, obovate leaves that are glossy and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody fruits containing oily seeds. These seeds are valued for their high oil content, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of biofuel. The plant also plays an important role in local ecosystems and is often found in lowland rainforests."
