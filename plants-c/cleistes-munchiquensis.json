    "intro": "Cleistes munchiquensis, commonly known as the Munchique cleistocarp, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its unique, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that are often hidden within a specialized, leaf-like bract. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous minute seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cleistes munchiquensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
