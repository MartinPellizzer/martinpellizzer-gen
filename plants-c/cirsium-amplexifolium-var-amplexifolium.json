    "intro": "Cirsium amplexifolium var. amplexifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, wavy-edged, spiny leaves that clasping the stem. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers in late summer, which are typically surrounded by bracts. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. Due to its prickly foliage, it is often avoided by herbivores, making it a resilient and common wild plant."
