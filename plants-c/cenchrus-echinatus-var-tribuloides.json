    "intro": "Cenchrus echinatus var. tribuloides, commonly known as the roughhairs grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soil. This variety is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock in dryland environments."
