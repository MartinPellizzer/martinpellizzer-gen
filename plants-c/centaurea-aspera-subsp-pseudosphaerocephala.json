    "intro": "Centaurea aspera subsp. pseudosphaerocephala, commonly known as the rough centaury, is a flowering plant species belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, bristly stems and small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense, spherical heads. Native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, this subspecies thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. It is often found in open fields, along roadsides, and in arid environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
