    "intro": "Ctenopteris thwaitesii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea holly, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green with a slight waxy coating. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found near coastal areas or in moist forest understories. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Ctenopteris thwaitesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
