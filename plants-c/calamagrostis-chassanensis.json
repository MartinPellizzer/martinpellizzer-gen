    "intro": "Calamagrostis chassanensis, commonly known as the Japanese silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and panicles of silky, silver-gray florets that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and along streambanks. It has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, contributing to its silvery sheen. Calamagrostis chassanensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
