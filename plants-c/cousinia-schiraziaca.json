    "intro": "Cousinia schiraziaca, commonly known as the Persian snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It produces fluffy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Cousinia schiraziaca is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental beauty in landscaping."
