    "intro": "Cyclamen hyemale, commonly known as the winter cyclamen, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late autumn to early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial shade, making it well-suited for woodland gardens or shaded rockeries. Its tuberous roots allow it to survive harsh winters, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Cyclamen hyemale is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
