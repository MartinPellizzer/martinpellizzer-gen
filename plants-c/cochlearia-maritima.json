    "intro": "Cochlearia maritima, commonly known as the sea kale, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other economically important plants. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces distinctive, inflated seed pods. Cochlearia maritima is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
