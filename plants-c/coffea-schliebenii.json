    "intro": "Coffea schliebenii, commonly known as the Schlieben's coffee, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the highlands of Ethiopia, where it grows at elevations between 1,800 and 2,400 meters. The plant produces small, red berries that contain two seeds, which are used to make coffee. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves and compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
