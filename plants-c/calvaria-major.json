    "intro": "Calvaria major, commonly known as the giant false holly, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a vibrant splash of color to its foliage. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-red berry that contains several seeds, and it is often used in traditional medicine. Calvaria major is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
