It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters. Its root system consists of slender, fibrous roots that help anchor it in wet soils. The plant is known for its peppery taste, similar to other members of the Brassicaceae family."
