    "intro": "Castalia stellaris, commonly known as the star castalia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, seed-containing capsules after blooming. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Castalia stellaris is considered a vulnerable species."
