    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nauseosus var. viridulus, commonly known as green burrobrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
