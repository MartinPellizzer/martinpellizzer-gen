It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features slender, often hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem.

This plant is often found in moist, open habitats such as woodland edges and wet meadows."
