    "intro": "Centaurea floccosa, commonly known as the woolly star-thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish-blue woolly foliage and striking purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. Centaurea floccosa is sometimes considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
