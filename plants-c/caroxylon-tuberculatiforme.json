    "intro": "Caroxylon tuberculatiforme, commonly known as the tuberculate caroxylon, is a rare and ancient plant species characterized by its unique tuberculate (bumpy) stem structure. It is a member of the family Alismataceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit with slender, segmented stems that often form dense mats. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Caroxylon tuberculatiforme is considered a conservation concern."
