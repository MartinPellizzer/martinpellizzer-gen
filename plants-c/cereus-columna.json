It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant has spiny, ribbed stems and produces large, showy flowers that bloom at night. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Its unique structure and nocturnal blooming make it a striking addition to desert gardens."
