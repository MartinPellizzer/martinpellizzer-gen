    "intro": "Carya glabra var. glabra, commonly known as the black hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the walnut family (Juglandaceae) and is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow catkins and female flowers, followed by edible, sweet-tasting nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and dry upland areas. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in providing food for wildlife."
