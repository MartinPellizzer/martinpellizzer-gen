    "intro": "Cortiella cortioides, commonly known as the common bird's nest fungus, is a small, delicate mushroom that belongs to the family Cortiniaceae. It is characterized by its unique, cup-shaped or bowl-like cap that often resembles a bird's nest, hence its common name. The fungus typically grows on decaying wood, particularly in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structure, known as a pileus, is often covered in a layer of fine, gelatinous material. This species is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often found in association with hardwood trees."
