    "intro": "Conanthera passeriflora f. melananthera, commonly known as the black-anther lily, is a botanical variant of the species Conanthera passeriflora. It is characterized by its distinctive black anthers, which contrast sharply with its typically white or pale floral structures. This subspecies belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is native to specific regions in South America. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its ornamental value is heightened by the striking color contrast between its black anthers and white petals."
