    "intro": "Cyathea membranulosa, commonly known as the membranous tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, smooth, often shiny trunk that is covered in a thin, membranous layer, giving it its common name. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. Cyathea membranulosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
