    "intro": "Carex brizoides var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
