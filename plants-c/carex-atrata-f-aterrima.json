    "intro": "Carex atrata f. aterrima, commonly known as the dark-leaved sedges, is a variant of the Carex atrata species, characterized by its deep, almost black foliage. This sedge is a perennial plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown in color. The plant is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, where it contributes to soil stabilization. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for water garden landscapes."
