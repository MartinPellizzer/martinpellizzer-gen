    "intro": "Carya amara var. myristiciformis, commonly known as the sweet gum or myristiciform sweet gum, is a variant of the sweet gum tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruit capsules that resemble the shape of a pine cone. The leaves are typically opposite, simple, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by the characteristic fruiting bodies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in floodplain forests."
