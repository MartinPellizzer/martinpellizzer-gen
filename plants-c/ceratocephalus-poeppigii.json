    "intro": "Ceratocephalus poeppigii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows from 10 to 30 centimeters in height, characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that resemble dandelion puffs. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Ceratocephalus poeppigii is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to the extreme conditions of its native habitat."
