    "intro": "Cancrinia tripinnatifida, commonly known as the three-lobed sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, tripinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often growing in dunes or along the shoreline. Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is an important species in coastal ecosystems."
