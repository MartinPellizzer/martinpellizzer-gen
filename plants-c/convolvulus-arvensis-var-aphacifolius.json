    "intro": "Convolvulus arvensis var. aphacifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf field bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, sprawling stems. It features small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pale pink to white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape, and often have a hairy texture. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical Convolvulus arvensis. It is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain regions."
