    "intro": "Cirsium drummondii subsp. lanatum, commonly known as Drummond's thistle, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The subspecies lanatum is distinguished by its dense, woolly covering on the leaves and stems, which provides a unique texture. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. This plant plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to arid environments."
