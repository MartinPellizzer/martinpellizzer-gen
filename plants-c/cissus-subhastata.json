    "intro": "Cissus subhastata, commonly known as the African grape or climbing fig, is a vigorous trailing vine native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often adorned with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, grape-like berries that are typically yellow or red when mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage. Cissus subhastata is also valued for its ability to climb and trail, making it suitable for hanging baskets or trellises."
