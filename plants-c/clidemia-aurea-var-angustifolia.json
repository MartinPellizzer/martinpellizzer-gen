    "intro": "Clidemia aurea var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf silverleaf, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
