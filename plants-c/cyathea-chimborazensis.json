It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, typically between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Its rhizome is thick and woody, supporting the growth of its tall stem and expansive foliage. The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, making it a striking feature in its natural habitat."
