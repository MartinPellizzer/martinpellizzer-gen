It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Centaurea castellana is also known for its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments."
