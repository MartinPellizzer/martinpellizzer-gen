It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in coastal areas and saline soils. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a hairy texture and produces delicate, violet-colored flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
