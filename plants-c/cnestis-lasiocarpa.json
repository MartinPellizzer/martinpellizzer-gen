It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. Cnestis lasiocarpa is often found in open woodland and grassland habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
