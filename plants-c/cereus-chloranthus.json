    "intro": "Cereus chloranthus, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom at night, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, thick stem with a single, spiny areole, and its leaves are reduced to spines. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit."
