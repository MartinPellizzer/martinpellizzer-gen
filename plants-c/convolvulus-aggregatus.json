It is a herbaceous annual that produces small, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are heart-shaped with a rough texture. Its tendrils allow it to climb and twine around other plants or structures. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a common weed in disturbed areas."
