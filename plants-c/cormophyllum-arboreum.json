    "intro": "Cormophyllum arboreum, commonly known as the tree cormophyllum, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Zingiberaceae, which includes gingers and related plants. The plant is characterized by its underground corm, which serves as a storage organ and enables it to survive periods of drought. Its flowering stems are tall and often bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The botanical features of Cormophyllum arboreum make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and scientific study."
