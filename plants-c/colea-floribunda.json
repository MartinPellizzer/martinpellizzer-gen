    "intro": "Colea floribunda, commonly known as the flowering colea, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant has strap-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Colea floribunda thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. It is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
