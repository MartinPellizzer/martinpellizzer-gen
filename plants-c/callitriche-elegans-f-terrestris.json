    "intro": "Callitriche elegans f. terrestris, commonly known as the terrestrial water starwort, is a low-growing aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features small, delicate, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with five petals. The plant has thin, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface or lie along the mud. It is often found in shallow waters and can spread rapidly through stolons, forming dense mats. Its botanical structure supports its role in stabilizing aquatic environments and providing habitat for microorganisms."
