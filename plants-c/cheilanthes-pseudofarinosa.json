    "intro": "Cheilanthes pseudofarinosa, commonly known as the rock brake, is a species of fern belonging to the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with clustered, lanceolate leaves that are usually dark green and slightly curled. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This plant is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often found in regions with limited moisture availability."
