It is characterized by its silvery-white, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural environment."
