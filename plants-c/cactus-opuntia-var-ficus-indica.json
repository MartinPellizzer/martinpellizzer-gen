    "intro": "Cactus opuntia var. ficus-indica, commonly known as the Indian fig cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its thick, waxy cuticle reduces water loss, and its spines provide protection from herbivores. This species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and as a source of food and traditional medicine."
