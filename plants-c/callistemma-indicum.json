    "intro": "Callistemma indicum, commonly known as the Indian pipe, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, including India and China. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, giving it a pale, almost ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and wetlands. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in a spire-like arrangement, and it produces small, dark berries as fruits. Despite its lack of chlorophyll, it is able to survive by forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi."
