    "intro": "Corymbia peltata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its pale pink to red flowers appear in clusters and are pollinated by birds and insects. The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in horticulture for its unique foliage and floral display."
