It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a distinctive warty texture, while its yellow flowers bloom in clusters. Coronopus verrucarius is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
