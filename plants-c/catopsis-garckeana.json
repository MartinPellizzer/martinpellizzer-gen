    "intro": "Catopsis garckeana, commonly known as the green rosette bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding structure at the center. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, which helps in water retention and protection against intense sunlight. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
