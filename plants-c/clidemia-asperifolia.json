    "intro": "Clidemia asperifolia, commonly known as roughleaf mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in small, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with showy bracts that attract pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Clidemia asperifolia is also known for its ability to form dense thickets, which can impact local ecosystems."
