It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and striking purple to reddish-purple foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant color and ability to form dense clumps."
