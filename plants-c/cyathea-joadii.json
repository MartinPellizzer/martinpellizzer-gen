    "intro": "Cyathea joadii, commonly known as the Joadii tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots. The plant features a crown of large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Cyathea joadii is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments."
