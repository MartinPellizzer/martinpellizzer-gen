    "intro": "Chrysodium fraxinifolium, commonly known as the goldenleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that turn a striking yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and conservation efforts."
