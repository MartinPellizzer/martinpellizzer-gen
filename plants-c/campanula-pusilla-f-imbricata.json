It features small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, ovate leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. Its stems are short and sturdy, often covered in fine pubescence. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
