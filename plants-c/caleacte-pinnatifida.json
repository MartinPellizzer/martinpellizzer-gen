    "intro": "Caleacte pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and bright blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often growing in rocky or sandy coastal habitats. Its structure includes a basal rosette of leaves with a flowering stem that rises above them. Caleacte pinnatifida is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent soil erosion."
