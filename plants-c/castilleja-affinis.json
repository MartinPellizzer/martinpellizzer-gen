    "intro": "Castilleja affinis, commonly known as the Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vivid red, orange, or yellow flowers that resemble a brush. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific host plants, allowing it to absorb water and minerals. Castilleja affinis is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodlands, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its environment."
