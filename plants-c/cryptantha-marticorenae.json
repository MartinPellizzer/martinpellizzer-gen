    "intro": "Cryptantha marticorenae, commonly known as the Sierra cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Nevada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions with deep root systems. Its seed pods are distinctive, splitting open to release minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
