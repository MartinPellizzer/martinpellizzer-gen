    "intro": "Chamaecyparis boursieri filiformis, commonly known as the lacewood or filiform cypress, is a rare and ornamental conifer native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant forms a compact, slow-growing shrub or small tree with a conical shape. Its foliage is evergreen, with a soft, bluish-green hue that adds a refined aesthetic to gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a unique addition to specialized horticultural collections."
