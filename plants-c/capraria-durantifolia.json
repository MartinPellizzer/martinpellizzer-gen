    "intro": "Capraria durantifolia, commonly known as the everlasting flower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Capraria durantifolia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ability to retain its color and form for extended periods has earned it the common name \"everlasting flower.\""
