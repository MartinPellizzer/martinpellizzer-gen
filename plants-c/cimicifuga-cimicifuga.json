    "intro": "Cimicifuga cimicifuga, commonly known as black cohosh, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and large, palmately compound leaves. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers in late summer, which are followed by bright red berries. Its roots and rhizomes are the primary parts used in herbal medicine for their phytoestrogenic properties. Cimicifuga cimicifuga thrives in woodland habitats and prefers moist, well-drained soils."
