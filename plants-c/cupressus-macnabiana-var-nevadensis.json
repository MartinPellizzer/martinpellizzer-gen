    "intro": "Cupressus macnabiana var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada cedar, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. It is characterized by its narrow, columnar growth habit and scale-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically found in clusters at the tips of the branches. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the cold, dry conditions of its high-altitude habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
