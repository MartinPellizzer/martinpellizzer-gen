    "intro": "Croton macrophyllus, commonly known as the giant croton, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 inches in diameter, making it a dramatic addition to any landscape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright orange or red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a specimen plant in tropical gardens."
