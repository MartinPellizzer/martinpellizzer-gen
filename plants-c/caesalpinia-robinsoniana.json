It is characterized by its bright red, flame-like inflorescences that appear in the spring, making it a striking ornamental plant. The leaves are bipinnate, with small, delicate leaflets that give it a feathery appearance. It produces long, woody pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for tropical and subtropical climates."
