    "intro": "Calamagrostis airoides, commonly known as the silver reed or blue reed, is a tall, clump-forming grass native to eastern North America. It features narrow, silver-blue foliage that turns coppery in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens and natural landscapes. The plant produces airy, feathery plumes in late summer, which attract pollinators like butterflies and bees. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and marshy areas. Due to its drought tolerance and attractive appearance, it is a popular choice for water-wise landscaping."
