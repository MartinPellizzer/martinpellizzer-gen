    "intro": "Calamus kubahensis, commonly known as the Bornean calamus, is a member of the Aroid family (Araceae). It is a climbing plant that can reach lengths of several meters, characterized by its long, slender rhizomes and lance-shaped leaves. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by berries, which are often dispersed by birds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
