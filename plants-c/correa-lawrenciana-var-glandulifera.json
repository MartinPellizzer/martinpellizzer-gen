    "intro": "Correa lawrenciana var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular correa, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are usually oval or elliptic, with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small, glandular structures on its stems and leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and ability to attract native pollinators."
