    "intro": "Cereus peruvianus var. ovicarpus, commonly known as the Peruvian apple cactus, is a succulent plant native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and clusters of white, night-blooming flowers. The plant produces large, fleshy, yellow or orange fruits that are edible and resemble apples. Its adaptations to high-altitude environments include thick, fleshy stems for water storage and reduced leaves to minimize transpiration. It is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its fruit in traditional Andean cuisine."
