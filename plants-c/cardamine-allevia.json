    "intro": "Cardamine allevia, commonly known as lesser watercress, is a small herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. The plant has alternate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small white flowers that appear in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, allowing it to thrive in wet soils. Cardamine allevia is often found in nutrient-rich, calcareous habitats and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
