    "intro": "Clermontia viridis, commonly known as the green clermontia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, vine-like stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and streamside areas. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Clermontia viridis is considered rare and is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
