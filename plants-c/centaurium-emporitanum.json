    "intro": "Centaurium emporitanum, commonly known as lesser centaury, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing herb with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright red or orange flowers, which are typically tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Centaurium emporitanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
