    "intro": "Chrozophora lepidocarpa, commonly known as the hairy false flax, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring woody stems and small, green, ovate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Chrozophora lepidocarpa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
