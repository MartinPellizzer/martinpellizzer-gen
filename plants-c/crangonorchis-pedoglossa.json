    "intro": "Crangonorchis pedoglossa, commonly known as the red-tailed shrimp, is a species of decapod crustacean found in marine environments. It is characterized by its elongated body and distinctive red-tailed appendages, which aid in camouflage and communication. The plant-like appearance of its exoskeleton is a notable botanical feature, though it is not a true plant. It thrives in coastal areas with sandy or muddy substrates, often in shallow waters. Crangonorchis pedoglossa plays a role in marine ecosystems as both predator and prey."
