    "intro": "Cynoglossum umbellatum, commonly known as hedge nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers in late summer. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. It has a long flowering period, with flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. However, all parts of the plant are toxic and should not be ingested."
