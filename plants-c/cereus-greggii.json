    "intro": "Cereus greggii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to produce large, fragrant white flowers at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration. Its flowers open only during the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Cereus greggii is popular among cactus enthusiasts for its striking appearance and unique blooming behavior."
