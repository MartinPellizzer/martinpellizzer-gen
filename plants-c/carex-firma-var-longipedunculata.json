    "intro": "Carex firma var. longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-stemmed sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps stabilize soil. The inflorescences are often reddish-brown when mature, adding ornamental value to wetland landscapes."
