    "intro": "Campanula collina var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, sky-blue to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine, soft hairs, giving the plant a slightly fuzzy appearance. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless stems and flowers, which set it apart from other campanula species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
