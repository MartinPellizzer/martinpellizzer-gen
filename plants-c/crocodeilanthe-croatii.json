    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe croatii, commonly known as the Croatian fern, is a rare and distinctive species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are arranged in a unique pattern along the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
