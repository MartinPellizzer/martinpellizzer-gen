    "intro": "Cupressus stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, columnar growth habit and dense, scale-like foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically dark green and arranged in crossed pairs along the shoots. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often used in landscaping for its formal shape and drought tolerance."
