    "intro": "Carex gravida, commonly known as the common sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and produces spikes of small, usually green or brown flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. Carex gravida plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
