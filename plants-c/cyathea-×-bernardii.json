    "intro": "Cyathea \u00d7 bernardii, commonly known as the hybrid tree fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cyathea cooperi and Cyathea humilis. It is a tall, upright fern that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of over 3 meters. The plant has a thick, trunk-like stem covered in fibrous, persistent roots, typical of tree ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and slow growth make it a popular ornamental plant in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
