    "intro": "Clematis tubulosa var. rosea, commonly known as the rose-colored clematis, is a flowering vine native to parts of Asia. It features delicate, fragrant flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep rose, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, climbing stems with opposite, trifoliate leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. Its flowers are tubular in shape, which makes them particularly attractive to pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
