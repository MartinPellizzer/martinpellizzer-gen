    "intro": "Cordia guaranitica var. foliosa, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or foliate cordia, is a species native to the Amazon rainforest. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its smooth, dark bark and lanceolate leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, spiny capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is of interest for ecological and conservation studies."
