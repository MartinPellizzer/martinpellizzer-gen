    "intro": "Chionochloa crassiuscula subsp. crassiuscula, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Southern Hemisphere, particularly New Zealand. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and dense clusters of short, hair-like leaves. The plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found on rocky slopes and in areas with poor soil. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to cold climates and is an important component of alpine vegetation."
