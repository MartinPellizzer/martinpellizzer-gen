    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe verbiformis, commonly known as the dragon's tail fern, is a unique epiphytic plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its unusual, creeping rhizome that resembles a dragon's tail. The plant produces small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, fuzzy hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Its distinctive appearance and growth habit make it a popular choice for tropical gardens and indoor cultivation."
