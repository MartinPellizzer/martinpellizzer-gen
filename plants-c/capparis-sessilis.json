It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and thorny branches. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Capparis sessilis is notable for its aromatic leaves and its historical use in traditional medicine."
