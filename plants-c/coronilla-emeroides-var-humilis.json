    "intro": "Coronilla emeroides var. humilis, commonly known as the creeping vetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces delicate, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in erosion control and as a ground cover."
