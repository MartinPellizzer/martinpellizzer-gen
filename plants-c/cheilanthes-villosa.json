    "intro": "Cheilanthes villosa, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, often in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. Cheilanthes villosa is well adapted to arid conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry climates."
