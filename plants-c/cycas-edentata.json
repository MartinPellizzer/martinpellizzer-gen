    "intro": "Cycas edentata, commonly known as the toothless cycad, is a primitive plant belonging to the family Cycadaceae. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being ovoid, both typically appearing at the base of the trunk. Cycas edentata is native to eastern Australia and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils in coastal and inland regions. It is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage and relatively unchanged morphology over millions of years."
