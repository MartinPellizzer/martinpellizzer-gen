    "intro": "Cotoneaster tripyrenus, commonly known as the three-lobed cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters, featuring dense, sprawling branches and small, elliptical leaves with three distinct lobes. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the autumn. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Cotoneaster tripyrenus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
