    "intro": "Cypripedium guttatum subsp. microsaccos, commonly known as the small-sac lady's slipper, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pouch-like lip that is often adorned with intricate markings. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale pink or white, with a single, prominent sepal and two smaller petals. This subspecies is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection for the floral trade."
