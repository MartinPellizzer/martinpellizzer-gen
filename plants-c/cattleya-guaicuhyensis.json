    "intro": "Cattleya guaicuhyensis, commonly known as the Guai\u00e7\u00fahyensis orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with vibrant orange and yellow petals, often featuring intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its tropical habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts."
