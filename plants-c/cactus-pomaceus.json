    "intro": "Cactus pomaceus, commonly known as the giant barrel cactus, is a tall, columnar cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a thick, ribbed stem that can grow up to 30 feet in height, adapted to store water in its succulent tissue. Its spines are modified leaves, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss through transpiration. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to efficiently absorb water after rare rainfall events."
