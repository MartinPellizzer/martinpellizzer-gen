    "intro": "Cerasus undulata, commonly known as the wavy cherry, is a species of shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive wavy or undulating leaf margins. The plant produces small, sweet, edible fruits that are similar to cherries but often have a more acidic flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its fruit. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge."
