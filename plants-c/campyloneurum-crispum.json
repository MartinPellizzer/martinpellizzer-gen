    "intro": "Campyloneurum crispum, commonly known as the curly fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to its host while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Campyloneurum crispum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in controlled indoor settings."
