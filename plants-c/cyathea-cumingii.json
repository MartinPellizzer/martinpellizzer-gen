    "intro": "Cyathea cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizome system supports the development of its massive, often umbrella-shaped crown. Cyathea cumingii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to humid, shaded environments."
