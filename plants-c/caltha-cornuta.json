    "intro": "Caltha cornuta, commonly known as the horned buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, yellow flowers with five to seven sepals that resemble horns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Caltha cornuta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
