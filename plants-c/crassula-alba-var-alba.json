It features fleshy, cylindrical stems covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers during the spring and summer months. It is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
