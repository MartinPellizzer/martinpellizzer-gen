It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds.
