    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis horsfieldii, commonly known as the Horsfield's ironwood, is a species of evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its dense, hard wood. The tree produces small, cup-shaped fruits that contain one or two seeds, typical of the genus. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in lowland and hill forests. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable but rare component of its native ecosystems."
