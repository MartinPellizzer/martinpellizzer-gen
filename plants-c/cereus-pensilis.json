    "intro": "Cereus pensilis, commonly known as the pendant cereus, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often drooping downward like a curtain. The plant produces striking white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Cereus pensilis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and nocturnal flowering habit."
