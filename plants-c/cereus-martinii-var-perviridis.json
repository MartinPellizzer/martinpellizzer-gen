    "intro": "Cereus martinii var. perviridis, commonly known as the Green Cereus, is a cacti species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that are highly fragrant. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to survive. Its unique appearance and nocturnal flowering make it a striking addition to desert gardens."
