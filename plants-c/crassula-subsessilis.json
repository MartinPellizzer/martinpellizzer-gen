    "intro": "Crassula subsessilis, commonly known as the Fat Plant or the Jade Plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate sunlight. Due to its compact growth habit, it is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant."
