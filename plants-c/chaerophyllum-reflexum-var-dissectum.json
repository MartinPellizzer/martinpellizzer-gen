    "intro": "Chaerophyllum reflexum var. dissectum, commonly known as the cutleaf hedge parsley, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features finely dissected, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and subtle floral display."
