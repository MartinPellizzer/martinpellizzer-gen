    "intro": "Caladenia catenata var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf spider orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to southern Australia. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant features a slender, hairy stem with a single, narrow leaf and a cluster of small, pale green to yellowish flowers. Its flowers are characterized by their intricate, spider-like appearance, with a single, elongated lip. This variety is relatively rare and is considered a priority for conservation due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
