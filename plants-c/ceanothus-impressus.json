    "intro": "Ceanothus impressus, commonly known as the coastal ceanothus, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its aromatic, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Ceanothus impressus is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators and stabilizing coastal dunes."
