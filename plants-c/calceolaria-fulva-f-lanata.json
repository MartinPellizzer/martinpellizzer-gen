    "intro": "Calceolaria fulva f. lanata, commonly known as the hairy yellow slipper orchid, is a striking member of the Campanulaceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to yellow flowers, which resemble small slippers, and its distinctive hairy foliage. Native to the Andes Mountains of South America, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments. The 'lanata' variety is distinguished by its dense, woolly hairs covering the leaves and stems, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
