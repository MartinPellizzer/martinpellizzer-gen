    "intro": "Crioceras longiflorus, commonly known as the long-flowered rock orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of delicate, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is typically found growing in open, sunny areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Crioceras longiflorus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
