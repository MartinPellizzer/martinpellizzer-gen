    "intro": "Cyperus rotundus var. tetrastachyos, commonly known as purple flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, purple or pinkish flowers. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread rapidly in moist soils. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in rice paddies and marshy areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
