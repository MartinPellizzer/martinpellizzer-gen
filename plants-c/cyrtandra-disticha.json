    "intro": "Cyrtandra disticha, commonly known as the twin-leaf heliconia, is a member of the Heliconiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, spiral-shaped inflorescences that consist of vibrant red bracts enclosing small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory species in humid, shaded forests, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a waxy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Cyrtandra disticha is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral structure."
