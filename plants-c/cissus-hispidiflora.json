It is characterized by its distinctive hairy leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round, yellowish fruits that are edible but not widely consumed. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Cissus hispidiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to climb surfaces in tropical and subtropical regions."
