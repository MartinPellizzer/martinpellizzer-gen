    "intro": "Cola flavescens, commonly known as the yellow cola tree, is a shrub or small tree native to western Africa. It belongs to the family Sterculiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elongated, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody pods containing several seeds. Cola flavescens is notable for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of caffeine. Its botanical features make it distinct from other cola species, particularly in its foliage and fruit structure."
