    "intro": "Calendula amplexifolia, commonly known as the creeping calendula, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and orange or red petals, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Calendula amplexifolia is often used in ornamental gardening and has historical uses in herbal medicine."
