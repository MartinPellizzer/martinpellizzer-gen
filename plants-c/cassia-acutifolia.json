    "intro": "Cassia acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cassia, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features compound leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by long, slender pods containing flat, winged seeds. Cassia acutifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable plant for gardens and landscapes."
