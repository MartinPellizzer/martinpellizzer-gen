    "intro": "Cacaliopsis, commonly known as the \"buttercup saxifrage,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are typically small, herbaceous perennials with showy, yellow or orange flowers that resemble those of buttercups. They are native to regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Cacaliopsis species have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, capsule-like fruits. Their botanical features make them interesting subjects for study in botany and horticulture."
