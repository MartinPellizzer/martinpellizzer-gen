    "intro": "Carex praecox subsp. schreberi, commonly known as the early sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. This subspecies typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, where it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
