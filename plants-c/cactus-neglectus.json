    "intro": "Cactus neglectus, commonly known as the desert ghost, is a unique succulent native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a low-growing, sprawling form with cylindrical stems that are typically greenish-gray in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss and deter herbivores. Cactus neglectus is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant."
