    "intro": "Cheilanthes lindigii, commonly known as the Lindig's rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 10 inches in length. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is often found growing on limestone or sandstone surfaces. It has a unique ability to store water in its rhizomes, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. Cheilanthes lindigii is a hardy, low-maintenance plant that is well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
