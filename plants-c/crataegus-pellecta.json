    "intro": "Crataegus pellecta, commonly known as the American hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 15 feet and features thorned branches, which are a distinctive botanical feature. The plant produces white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges, and it often thrives in woodland or open areas. The American hawthorn is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
