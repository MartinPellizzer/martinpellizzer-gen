It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical rhizomes and long, flexible leaves that often grow in dense clusters. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as marshes and riverbanks. Its rhizomes are frequently harvested for use in basket weaving and as a source of aromatic oils. The species is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality in wetland ecosystems."
