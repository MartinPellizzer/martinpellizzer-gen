    "intro": "Calais, commonly known as *Calais* or *Calaisia*, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, often colorful spathes that enclose the inflorescence. The leaves are typically broad and arrow-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps in water retention. Calais species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant and exotic appearance."
