    "intro": "Chromolaena anachoretica, commonly known as black mangrove, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, round berries. Chromolaena anachoretica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
