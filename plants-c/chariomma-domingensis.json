It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, greyish bark. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by dark blue, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
