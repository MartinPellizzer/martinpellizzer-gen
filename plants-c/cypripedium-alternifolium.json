    "intro": "Cypripedium alternifolium, commonly known as the alternate-leaf lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or white flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip. The plant typically grows in cool, moist forest habitats, often in shaded understories. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy texture. Cypripedium alternifolium is a protected species due to habitat loss and over-collection."
