    "intro": "Carex longifolia var. minor, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale to greenish flowers. Native to wet or moist habitats, this plant is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
