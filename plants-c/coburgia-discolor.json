    "intro": "Coburgia discolor, commonly known as the pink and white hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a contrasting central stripe. The plant features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are glossy and arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Coburgia discolor is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
