It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and features small, leathery, evergreen leaves. The plant is typically found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices, thriving in arid or semi-arid environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are usually dichotomously branched and have a distinctive, glossy appearance."
