    "intro": "Cassytha piligera, commonly known as the creeping dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using specialized haustoria to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and has slender, twining stems that can cover large areas. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, and it relies entirely on its hosts for survival. Cassytha piligera is often found in moist, shaded environments and can be invasive in certain ecosystems."
