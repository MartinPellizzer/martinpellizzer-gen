    "intro": "Calonyction album, commonly known as the white sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Calonyction album is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
