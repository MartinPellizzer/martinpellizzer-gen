It features dense, upright growth with dark green, oval leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, spiny husks that enclose edible hazelnuts, which are a valuable food source for wildlife and humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and attractive form."
