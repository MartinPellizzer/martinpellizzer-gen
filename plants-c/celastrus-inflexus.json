It is a woody vine that typically grows in moist woodlands and along stream banks. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are follicles that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a slightly serrated edge."
