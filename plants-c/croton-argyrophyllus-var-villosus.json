    "intro": "Croton argyrophyllus var. villosus, commonly known as the silky croton, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive, almost metallic appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking foliage. Due to its unique appearance, it is popular in tropical gardens and as a houseplant in warmer climates."
