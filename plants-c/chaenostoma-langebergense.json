    "intro": "Chaenostoma langebergense, commonly known as the Langeberg waterwheel, is a perennial aquatic plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers that are typically submerged or floating. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often in ponds and lakes. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
