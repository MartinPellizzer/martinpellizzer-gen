    "intro": "Chenopodium berlandieri var. foetens, commonly known as pigweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is native to North America and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in agricultural fields. It has a short, stout stem and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Pigweed is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered a weed due to its invasive tendencies."
