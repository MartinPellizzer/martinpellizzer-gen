It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and durable wood, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural and commercial purposes."
