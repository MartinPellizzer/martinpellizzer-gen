    "intro": "Chrysopsis villosa var. foliosa, commonly known as the woolly goldenweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are small and clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences, making it a distinctive member of the Asteraceae family."
