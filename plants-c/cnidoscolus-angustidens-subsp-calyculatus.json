    "intro": "Cnidoscolus angustidens subsp. calyculatus, commonly known as the arrow leaf batok, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by edible, spiny fruits that contain a starchy, tuberous interior. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its unique appearance and nutritional value, it is both a horticultural curiosity and a potential food source in certain regions."
