    "intro": "Cydonia vulgaris communis, commonly known as the quince, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces fragrant, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its characteristic, rough, citrus-scented fruit. The fruit is typically harvested in late autumn and is known for its high content of pectin and tannins. The plant has a deep root system and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as for its edible fruit."
