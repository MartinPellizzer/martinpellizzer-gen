    "intro": "Cydonia cydonia var. pyriformis, commonly known as the Persian apple or quince, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and South Asia. It produces a distinctive, fragrant fruit that is typically pear-shaped, hence its cultivar name \"pyriformis,\" meaning pear-like. The plant has a rugged, gnarled appearance with thick, woody stems and large, ovate leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. The fruit is often used in cooking and has a unique, aromatic flavor when cooked."
