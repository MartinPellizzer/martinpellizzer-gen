    "intro": "Combretum leiophyllum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its adaptability and drought tolerance contribute to its widespread cultivation in warm climates."
