    "intro": "Celtis lima, commonly known as the Mexican hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It belongs to the Elm family (Ulmaceae) and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, round berries that ripen to a dark purple color. Celtis lima is valued for its hardiness, adaptability to various soil types, and its role in providing habitat and food for wildlife."
