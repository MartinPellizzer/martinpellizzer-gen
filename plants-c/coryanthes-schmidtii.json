    "intro": "Coryanthes schmidtii, commonly known as the Schmidt's boat orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its unique, boat-shaped flower that resembles a small boat, hence its common name. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers with intricate patterns, which are highly attractive to specific pollinators. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its striking floral display."
