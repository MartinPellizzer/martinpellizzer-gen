    "intro": "Carex vulgaris subsp. alpina, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, with narrow, grass-green leaves that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate low light conditions."
