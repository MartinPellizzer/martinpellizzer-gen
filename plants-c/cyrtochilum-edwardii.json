    "intro": "Cyrtochilum edwardii, commonly known as Edward's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. Cyrtochilum edwardii thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
