    "intro": "Corchorus serrifolius, commonly known as the prickly lettuce, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Amaranthaceae. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant features distinctive, serrated, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in loose inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. The plant is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
