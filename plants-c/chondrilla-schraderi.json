    "intro": "Chondrilla schraderi, commonly known as Schrader's chondrilla, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant is typically perennial, with a low-growing, mat-forming habit that helps it survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which reduces water loss. The small yellow flowers appear in summer, contributing to its role in supporting local pollinators."
