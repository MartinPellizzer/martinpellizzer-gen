    "intro": "Carya leiodermis, commonly known as the smooth hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the walnut family (Juglandaceae) and is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by edible, sweet-honeyed nuts enclosed in spiny husks. Its wood is hard and strong, historically valued for tool handles and construction. The plant plays an important ecological role, providing food for wildlife and supporting diverse forest ecosystems."
