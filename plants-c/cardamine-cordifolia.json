    "intro": "Cardamine cordifolia, commonly known as heartleaf watercress, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and small white or pink flowers that appear in the axils of the leaves. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant's rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils make it an important component of ecological succession in wetland habitats."
