    "intro": "Cotoneaster cotoneaster subvar. depressus, commonly known as the low cotoneaster, is a shrub native to the eastern Himalayas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a border plant."
