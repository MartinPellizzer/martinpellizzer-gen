    "intro": "Corothamnus diffusus, commonly known as creeping thimbleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features wiry, sprawling stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant has small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Corothamnus diffusus is often found in the understory of forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
