    "intro": "Chuquiraga hispida, commonly known as the Andean burro's tail, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features dense clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine, bristly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Chuquiraga hispida is often found in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes."
