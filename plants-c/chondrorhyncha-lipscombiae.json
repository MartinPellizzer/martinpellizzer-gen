    "intro": "Chondrorhyncha lipscombiae, commonly known as the Lipscomb's coralroot, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in a raceme, typically blooming in late spring. Its roots are specialized for forming symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which provide the necessary nutrients for survival. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
