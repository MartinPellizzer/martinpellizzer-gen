    "intro": "Cynanchum rensonii, commonly known as the Chinese milkweed vine, is a perennial climbing plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Cynanchum rensonii is valued in traditional medicine but requires caution due to its potentially harmful properties."
