    "intro": "Collinsia bicolor, commonly known as the twinflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that typically display two contrasting colors. The plant belongs to the Polemoniaceae family and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that aids in water retention. Collinsia bicolor blooms in late spring to early summer, adding a striking visual element to its natural environment."
