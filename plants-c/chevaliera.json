    "intro": "Chevaliera, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by winged fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
