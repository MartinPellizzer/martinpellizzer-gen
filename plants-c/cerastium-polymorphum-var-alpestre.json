    "intro": "Cerastium polymorphum var. alpestre, commonly known as alpine mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically opposite and oval in shape. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its compact growth habit and ability to withstand cold temperatures, it is well adapted to high-altitude environments."
