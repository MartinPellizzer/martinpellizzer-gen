    "intro": "Cleisostoma poilanei, commonly known as the Poirane's cleistostoma, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are often enclosed within a specialized structure called a cleistogamous bud, which opens only under specific conditions. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by enthusiasts for its unique floral display."
