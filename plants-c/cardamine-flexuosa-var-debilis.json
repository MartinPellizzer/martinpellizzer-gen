    "intro": "Cardamine flexuosa var. debilis, commonly known as the slender water cress, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It typically grows in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small, white flowers that appear in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from waterlogged soils. This variety is closely related to other members of the Roridula family, sharing similar ecological and morphological traits."
