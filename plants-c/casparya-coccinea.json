    "intro": "Casparya coccinea, commonly known as the red-flowered casparya, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and colorful flowers. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright red, globe-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Casparya coccinea is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
