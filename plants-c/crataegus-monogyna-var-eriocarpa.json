    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna var. eriocarpa, commonly known as the smooth hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the autumn, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Botanically, it is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous bark and the presence of persistent, woody fruits."
