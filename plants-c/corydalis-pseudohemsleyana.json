    "intro": "Corydalis pseudohemsleyana, commonly known as the Hemsley's corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds within its pods, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or woodland settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
