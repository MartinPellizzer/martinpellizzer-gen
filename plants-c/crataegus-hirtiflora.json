    "intro": "Crataegus hirtiflora, commonly known as the hairy-flowered hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate to elliptic leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are edible but often tart. Crataegus hirtiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
