It belongs to the family Calophyllaceae and is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Its roots and bark are traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties. The tree is also valued for its durable, fragrant wood, which is used in the production of incense and furniture."
