    "intro": "Carex variabilis var. sciaphila, commonly known as the shade-loving sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It typically grows in wetlands, stream banks, and forest understories where it thrives in cool, damp conditions. The plant features grass-like leaves that are usually narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
