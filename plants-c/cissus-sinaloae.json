It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tint. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by green, spherical fruits that turn red when mature. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Cissus sinaloae is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to climb trellises or walls."
