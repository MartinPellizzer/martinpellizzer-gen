It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Its leaves are usually broad and elliptical, and it produces a single flower per stem, often in late spring. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is commonly cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
