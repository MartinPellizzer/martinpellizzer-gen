It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, rushes, and similar plants. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its leaves are grass-like, with a triangular cross-section, and it produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wetland ecosystems."
