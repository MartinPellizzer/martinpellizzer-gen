    "intro": "Corypha utan, commonly known as the giant panda palm, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, fan-shaped leaves that can reach several meters in diameter. The plant produces large, ornamental flower clusters that eventually develop into edible fruits resembling large, spiky pineapples. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize soil in its native habitat. Due to its size and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in warm climates."
