    "intro": "Carex vaginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, rushes, and similar plants. The plant typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth, waxy surface, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters. Carex vaginata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
