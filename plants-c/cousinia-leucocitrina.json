    "intro": "Cousinia leucocitrina, commonly known as the white-flowered cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Cousinia leucocitrina is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
