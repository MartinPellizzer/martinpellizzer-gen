    "intro": "Clematis funebris, commonly known as the black clematis, is a climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black stems and heart-shaped, velvety leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a dramatic, flowering vine."
