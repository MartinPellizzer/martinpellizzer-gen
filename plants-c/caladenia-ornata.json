    "intro": "Caladenia ornata, commonly known as the golden spider-orchid, is an exquisite member of the orchid family native to Australia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow petals and a distinctive, spider-like appearance of its flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in open habitats, often in regions with a Mediterranean climate. Caladenia ornata is a terrestrial orchid that produces a single, erect stem bearing a single flower. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in some parts of its range."
