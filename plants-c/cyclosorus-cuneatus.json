    "intro": "Cyclosorus cuneatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water clover, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually submerged and produce tiny, wind-pollinated seeds. Cyclosorus cuneatus plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
