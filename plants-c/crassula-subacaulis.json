It features dense, rounded rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring season. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or container cultivation. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
