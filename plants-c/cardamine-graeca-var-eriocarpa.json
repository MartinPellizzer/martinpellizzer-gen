    "intro": "Cardamine graeca var. eriocarpa, commonly known as the Greek watercress, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of the Balkans and Turkey. It features slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with a peppery scent. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
