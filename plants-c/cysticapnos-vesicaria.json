It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately divided, with a rough texture. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent pod that splits open to release its seeds, a feature typical of the Brassicaceae family."
