    "intro": "Calamovilfa brevipilis var. typica, commonly known as the short-pilose calamovilfa, is a perennial grass species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with short, fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
