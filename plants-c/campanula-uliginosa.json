    "intro": "Campanula uliginosa, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and bog habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features striking blue to violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows up to 30\u201360 cm tall, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Campanula uliginosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
