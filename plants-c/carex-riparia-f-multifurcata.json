    "intro": "Carex riparia f. multifurcata, commonly known as the forked sedge, is a variant of the common sedge, characterized by its distinctive branching structure. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The botanical interest of this form lies in its unique branching pattern, which differs from the typical growth form of the species."
