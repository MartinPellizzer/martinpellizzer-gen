    "intro": "Cupressus benthamii var. lindleyi, commonly known as the Lindley's lacebark, is a rare and ornamental evergreen conifer native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive, flaky, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, spherical cones and has scale-like leaves that are closely arranged along the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists."
