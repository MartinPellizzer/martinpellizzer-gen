    "intro": "Calamagrostis villosa var. ramosa, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a grass species native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to form clumps with long, arching leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
