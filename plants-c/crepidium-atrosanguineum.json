    "intro": "Crepidium atrosanguineum, commonly known as the black blood orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark purple to blackish stems and leaves, which are often covered in a fine, hairy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in many parts of its range."
