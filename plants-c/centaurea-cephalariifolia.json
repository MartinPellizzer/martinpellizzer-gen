    "intro": "Centaurea cephalariifolia, commonly known as the alpine centaury, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bract-like structures that resemble a crown, giving it its species name. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats. Centaurea cephalariifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its resilience and beauty."
