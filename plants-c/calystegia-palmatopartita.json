    "intro": "Calystegia palmatopartita, commonly known as the broad-leaved morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant is a vigorous climber, often found in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
