    "intro": "Catasetum claesianum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphytic or lithophytic orchid, often found on trees or rocks in humid environments. Its flowers are unique in that they have a specialized structure called a \"labellum,\" which plays a role in pollination by mimicking the appearance of female bees. Catasetum claesianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
