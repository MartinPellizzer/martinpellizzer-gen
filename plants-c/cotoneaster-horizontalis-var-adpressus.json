    "intro": "Cotoneaster horizontalis var. adpressus, commonly known as the creeping cotoneaster, is a low-growing shrub native to China. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along its stems. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in gardens across temperate regions."
