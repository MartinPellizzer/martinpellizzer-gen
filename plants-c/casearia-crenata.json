It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruits are small, spherical berries that turn from green to yellow or orange as they mature. Casearia crenata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
