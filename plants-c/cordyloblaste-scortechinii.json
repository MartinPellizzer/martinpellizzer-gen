    "intro": "Cordyloblaste scortechinii, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique and rare plant species native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically found on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cordyloblaste scortechinii is considered a vulnerable species."
