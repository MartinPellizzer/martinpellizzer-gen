    "intro": "Clematis viorna var. violacea, commonly known as the purple clematis, is a deciduous vine native to parts of Asia. It features showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are typically covered in fine, rusty-colored hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Its ornamental value comes from both its vibrant flowers and its vigorous climbing habit."
