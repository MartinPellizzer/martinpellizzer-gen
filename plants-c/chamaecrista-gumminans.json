    "intro": "Chamaecrista gumminans, commonly known as the sticky bush, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from yellow to red, and its compound leaves with stipules. The plant is notable for producing a sticky, resinous substance from its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Chamaecrista gumminans is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
