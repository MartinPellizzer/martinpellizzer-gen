    "intro": "Cistanthe aegialitis, commonly known as the coastal cistanthe, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and succulent, adapted to withstand salty sea air and arid conditions. Cistanthe aegialitis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
