    "intro": "Cassia aschrek, commonly known as golden shower tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its long, drooping clusters of yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is valued for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
