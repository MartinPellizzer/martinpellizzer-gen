It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
