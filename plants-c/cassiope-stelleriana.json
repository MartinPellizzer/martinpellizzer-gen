    "intro": "Cassiope stelleriana, commonly known as the alpine beauty or star moss, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the rocky alpine regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Cassiope stelleriana thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in mountainous areas with high elevations and cool climates. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a valued plant in both horticulture and conservation efforts."
