    "intro": "Copernicia molinetii var. cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf copernicia, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its slender, feather-like leaves that are typically arranged in a fan shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, coconut-like fruits. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize coastal soils, making it valuable for erosion control. This variety is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils."
