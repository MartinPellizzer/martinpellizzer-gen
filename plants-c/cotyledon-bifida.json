    "intro": "Cotyledon bifida, commonly known as the \"bifida leaf\" or \"cork plant,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it store water. The leaves are usually oval or heart-shaped, with a distinctive split or notched appearance along the edges. It produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer seasons. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
