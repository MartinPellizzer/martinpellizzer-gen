    "intro": "Claytonia sibirica var. alsinoides, commonly known as the Siberian chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Siberia and Central Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and resilient plant well-suited to temperate climates."
