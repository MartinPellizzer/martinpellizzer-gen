    "intro": "Cocculus toxicofer, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by elongated, spindle-shaped fruits. Its roots and seeds contain toxic compounds, including bufotenin, which have been used traditionally in some cultures. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in horticulture and requires caution during handling."
