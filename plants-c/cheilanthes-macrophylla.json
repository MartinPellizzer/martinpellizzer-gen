    "intro": "Cheilanthes macrophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and Mexico. It is characterized by its robust, evergreen rhizomes and large, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a single row along the undersides of the leaves. This fern is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
