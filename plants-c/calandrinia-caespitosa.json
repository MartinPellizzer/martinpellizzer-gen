    "intro": "Calandrinia caespitosa, commonly known as the cluster pink, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense clusters of small, pink or red flowers. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water, making it drought-tolerant. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and sandy environments. Its compact growth habit and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
