    "intro": "Caprifolium longiflorum, commonly known as the long-flowered honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend trees and shrubs. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a small, red berry that matures in the fall and is edible for both humans and wildlife."
