    "intro": "Cynosciadium, commonly known as cowbane, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It consists of several species, many of which are toxic to livestock and humans. The plants typically have finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels. They are often found in disturbed soils and open habitats across temperate regions. Due to their toxicity, they are sometimes considered weeds in agricultural areas."
