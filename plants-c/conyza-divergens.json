    "intro": "Conyza divergens, commonly known as the common horseweed, is an annual flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are alternate, hairy, and have a serrated margin, while the flowers are yellow and produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. Conyza divergens is often considered a weed but has ecological importance as a food source for various insects and birds."
