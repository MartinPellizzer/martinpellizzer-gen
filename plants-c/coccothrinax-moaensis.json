    "intro": "Coccothrinax moaensis, commonly known as the Moa palm, is a species of palm native to the island of Moa in the South Pacific. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed trunk and pinnate leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into clustered, spiny fruits. It thrives in coastal and lowland habitats, often growing in sandy or well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss and historical deforestation, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
