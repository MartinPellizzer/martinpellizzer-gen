    "intro": "Cereus lecchii, commonly known as the Lecchi's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to southern South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in arid environments with well-drained soil. Cereus lecchii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming behavior."
