    "intro": "Cereus speciosissimus var. latifrons, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a cactus species native to the dry regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking red, pink, or orange flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a distinctive structure, with a swollen, often colorful stem known as a \"pseudostem\" and a small, spiny base. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. This species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of care."
