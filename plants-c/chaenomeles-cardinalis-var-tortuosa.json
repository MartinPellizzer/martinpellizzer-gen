    "intro": "Chaenomeles cardinalis var. tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted Chinese quince, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features thick, gnarled stems that often twist and curl, giving it a distinctive, almost sculptural appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by ornamental, orange-red fruits. Its leaves are ovate and have a slightly serrated edge, adding to its visual interest. This variety is valued in horticulture for its unique form and seasonal display of color."
