    "intro": "Cystorchis saprophytica, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, slender stem and a single, delicate flower that often appears to hover above the ground. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive, almost translucent appearance. Due to its specialized habitat requirements and limited distribution, Cystorchis saprophytica is considered a threatened species."
