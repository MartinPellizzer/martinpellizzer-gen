    "intro": "Cyrtomium tengii, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
