    "intro": "Celmisia chapmannii, commonly known as the Stewart Island celmisia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit. The plant features slender, hairy stems and produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in the understorey of temperate forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
