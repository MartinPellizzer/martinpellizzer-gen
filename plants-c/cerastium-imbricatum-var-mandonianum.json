    "intro": "Cerastium imbricatum var. mandonianum, commonly known as the Mandon's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or shaded rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, ground-covering plant."
