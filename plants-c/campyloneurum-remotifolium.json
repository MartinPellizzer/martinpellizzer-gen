    "intro": "Campyloneurum remotifolium, commonly known as the remote-leaved clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern that belongs to the family Huperjiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, spirally arranged leaves that form dense, cushion-like clusters. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction. Native to moist, shaded environments in the Appalachian region of North America, it thrives in rocky or acidic soils. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is often found in forest understories and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
