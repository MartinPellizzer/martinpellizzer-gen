    "intro": "Chondropetalum hookerianum, commonly known as the Hooker's spikemoss, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant characterized by its creeping stems and small, scale-like leaves. Native to New Zealand, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant produces sporophytes that develop into spore-bearing structures called strobila. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native habitat."
