    "intro": "Cytisus laburnum, commonly known as the golden robin, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, forming pendulous racemes. The plant has slender, woody stems with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and hedging. The seeds are enclosed in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread."
