    "intro": "Carex emoryi, commonly known as Emory's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces hard, wind-dispersed seeds. Emory's sedge plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
