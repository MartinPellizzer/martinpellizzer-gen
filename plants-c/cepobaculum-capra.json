    "intro": "Cepobaculum capra, commonly known as the goat's foot plant, is a rare and unique species belonging to the family Cepobacelaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, hoof-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color, which are followed by capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Cepobaculum capra is considered a vulnerable species."
