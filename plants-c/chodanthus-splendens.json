    "intro": "Chodanthus splendens, commonly known as the splendour grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, silky hairs, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often hairy. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by specialty growers."
