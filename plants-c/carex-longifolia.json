    "intro": "Carex longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically longer than they are wide, often reaching lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in aquatic environments. Carex longifolia is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
