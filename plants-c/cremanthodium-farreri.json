    "intro": "Cremanthodium farreri, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada cushion plant, is a small, low-growing perennial found in the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its dense rosette of hairy, narrow leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, rocky habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the spring and early summer. It is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in open, sunny areas on slopes or talus. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
