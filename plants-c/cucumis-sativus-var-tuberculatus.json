    "intro": "Cucumis sativus var. tuberculatus, commonly known as the knobby cucumber, is a variant of the common cucumber characterized by its rough, warty surface. This plant is an annual vine that thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its flowers are typically yellow and are pollinated by insects, leading to the development of elongated, cylindrical fruits. The fruit is usually harvested when it is still immature, before it fully matures and becomes bitter. It is often used in culinary applications similar to the common cucumber, though its unique texture makes it a specialty item in some regions."
