It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces berries that contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though caution is advised due to its toxicity."
