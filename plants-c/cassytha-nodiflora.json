    "intro": "Cassytha nodiflora, commonly known as the twining morning glory, is a tropical vine native to Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems that twine around other plants, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in clusters. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Cassytha nodiflora is adapted to wet, humid environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and riverbanks."
