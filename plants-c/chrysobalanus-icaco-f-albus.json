    "intro": "Chrysobalanus icaco f. albus, commonly known as white mangrove, is a variant of the mangrove species native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale, almost white bark and its ability to thrive in saline and tidal environments. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement, and it produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, fleshy berries. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species. The white mangrove is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
