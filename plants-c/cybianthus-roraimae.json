    "intro": "Cybianthus roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima sky flower, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the tepuis of Venezuela. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters at the tips of its slender stems. The plant thrives in the nutrient-poor, acidic soils of the tepuis, where it has adapted to the unique microclimate and high-altitude conditions. Its morphology includes narrow, grass-like leaves and a short, upright stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
