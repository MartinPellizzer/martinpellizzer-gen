    "intro": "Cornulaca, commonly known as goatweed, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Amaranthaceae family. It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in hot, dry climates. They have a deep root system that allows them to survive in poor soil conditions. Cornulaca species are sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock."
