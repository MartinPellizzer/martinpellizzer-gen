    "intro": "Coussarea stenocalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved coussarea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite, and usually elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Coussarea stenocalyx is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
