    "intro": "Calligonum turbineum var. subulatum, commonly known as the desert sand spurge, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, spiny leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species for desert ecosystems. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in extreme conditions."
