    "intro": "Clerodendrum foetidum, commonly known as the stinking clerodendrum, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small seeds, aiding in its dispersal. The plant is also known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the leaves are crushed."
