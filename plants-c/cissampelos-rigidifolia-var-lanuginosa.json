It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by orange or red berries, which are edible but not widely cultivated. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its hairy foliage and unique fruit make it a notable species in botanical gardens and ecological studies."
