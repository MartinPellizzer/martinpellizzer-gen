    "intro": "Cotula tripinnata, commonly known as the three-parted groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are finely divided, giving it a feathery appearance, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Cotula tripinnata is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
