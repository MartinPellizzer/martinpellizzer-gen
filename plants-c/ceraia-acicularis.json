    "intro": "Ceraia acicularis, commonly known as the slender sea snail, is a species of sea snail in the family Littorinidae. It is a small gastropod mollusk characterized by its elongated, conical shell that is typically pale in color with a smooth surface. The species is found in marine environments, particularly in coastal areas with rocky substrates. Its diet consists mainly of algae, which it scrapes from surfaces using its radula. The shell provides protection against predation and environmental stressors, making it an important feature of its survival strategy."
