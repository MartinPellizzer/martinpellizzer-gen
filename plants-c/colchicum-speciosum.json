    "intro": "Colchicum speciosum, commonly known as the showy autumn crocus, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a corm, which is a modified stem used for storage. Its flowers are typically borne on tall, erect stems and are surrounded by leaf-like bracts. Colchicum speciosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
