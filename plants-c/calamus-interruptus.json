    "intro": "Calamus interruptus, commonly known as the interrupted horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are often ribbed and covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are typically found near the ground. Calamus interruptus thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living vascular plants."
