    "intro": "Carex longirostris, commonly known as the long-beaked sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Carex longirostris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in wetland environments."
