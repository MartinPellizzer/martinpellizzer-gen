    "intro": "Cotyledon saxatilis, commonly known as the rock cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to rocky areas of southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for rock gardens or containers. Cotyledon saxatilis is drought-tolerant and prefers well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
