It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, leaf-like structures that store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires minimal water to survive. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
