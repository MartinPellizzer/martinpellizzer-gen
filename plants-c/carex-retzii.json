    "intro": "Carex retzii, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Carex retzii is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
