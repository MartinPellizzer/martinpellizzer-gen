    "intro": "Cytinus andrieuxii, commonly known as the Egyptian hen of the woods, is a unique parasitic plant belonging to the family Cytinaceae. It is characterized by its fleshy, reddish-orange stems and a single, large, umbrella-like flower that blooms in the spring. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has a modified stem that serves as both a photosynthetic organ and a means of attachment to its host. It is primarily found in arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East, where it grows on the roots of leguminous plants. Its unusual morphology and parasitic lifestyle make it an intriguing subject in botanical studies."
