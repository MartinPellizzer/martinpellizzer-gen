    "intro": "Caesalpinia velutina, commonly known as velvetwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its fruit is a long, slender pod that splits open to release seeds. Caesalpinia velutina is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
