It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically orange to red in color, attracting pollinators like butterflies and bees. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable species in its native range."
