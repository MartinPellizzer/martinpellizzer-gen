    "intro": "Cuscuta basarabica, commonly known as the sand dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that begins with seeds dispersed by wind or animals. The plant attaches itself to its host using specialized haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is often found growing on plants such as grasses, shrubs, and trees in arid or semi-arid environments. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it both a challenging weed and an interesting subject of botanical study."
