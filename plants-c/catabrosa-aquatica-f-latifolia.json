    "intro": "Catabrosa aquatica f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved water catabrosa, is a rare aquatic plant characterized by its wide, flat leaves that float on the water surface. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is native to specific regions in South America. The plant's leaves are typically green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshes and ponds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
