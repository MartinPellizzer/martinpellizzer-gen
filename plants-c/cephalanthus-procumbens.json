    "intro": "Cephalanthus procumbens, commonly known as sweet pepperbush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge. Cephalanthus procumbens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
