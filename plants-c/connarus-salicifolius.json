    "intro": "Connarus salicifolius, commonly known as the willow-leaved connarus, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches and simple, alternate leaves that resemble willow leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
