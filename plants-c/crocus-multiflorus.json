    "intro": "Crocus multiflorus, commonly known as the Persian crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves emerge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and a short, sturdy stem. Its bulbs are adapted to survive harsh winter conditions, allowing it to bloom reliably each year. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other early spring pollinators."
