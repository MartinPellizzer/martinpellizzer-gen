It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, it thrives in wetland environments such as marshes and swamps. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
