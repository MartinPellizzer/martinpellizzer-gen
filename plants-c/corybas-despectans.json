    "intro": "Corybas despectans, commonly known as the foul-tasting hooded orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like flower that resembles a skull, giving it a somewhat ominous appearance. Native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a dark central marking, and they emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract its specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Corybas despectans is considered a vulnerable species."
