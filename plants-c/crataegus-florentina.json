    "intro": "Crataegus florentina, commonly known as the Florentine hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but typically used in jams and preserves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Crataegus florentina is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
