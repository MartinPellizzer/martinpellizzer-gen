    "intro": "Ceanothus greggii var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the wooly ceanothus, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant blue or purple flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
