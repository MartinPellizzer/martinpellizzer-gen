    "intro": "Copiapoa coquimbana subsp. pendulina, commonly known as the pendulous copiapoa, is a cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and clusters of white, tubular flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces a dense, woolly covering of pale green to white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and protected plant."
