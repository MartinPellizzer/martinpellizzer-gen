It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough texture. Carphochaete gummifera is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It is also known for secreting a sticky, resinous substance from its stems, which gives it its common name."
