    "intro": "Cereus schrankii, commonly known as the Schrank's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, a trait typical of many night-blooming cacti. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system adapted to arid environments. The plant is often cultivated for its striking floral display and resilience in dry conditions."
