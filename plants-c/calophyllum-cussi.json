    "intro": "Calophyllum cussi, commonly known as the red sandalwood or cussi tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Calophyllaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and showy, fragrant yellow flowers. The tree produces hard, heavy fruits that contain a single, large, reddish-brown seed. Its wood is highly valued for its rich color and durability, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and furniture. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range."
