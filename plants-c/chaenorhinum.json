    "intro": "Chaenorhinum, commonly known as the common honesty, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Scrophulariaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny, white seeds, which are often referred to as \"honesty\" due to their appearance. Chaenorhinum thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in roadsides, waste areas, and gardens. It is an annual plant that blooms from late spring to early autumn."
