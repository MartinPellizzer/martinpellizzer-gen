    "intro": "Crataegus subaudens, commonly known as the slender hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in the fall. Crataegus subaudens is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and moist soils, making it a valuable component of native plant communities."
