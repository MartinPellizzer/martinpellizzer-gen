    "intro": "Cinchona lechleriana, commonly known as the Leclerq's quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and ornamental flowers. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale pink petals. It is often cultivated for its medicinal properties, particularly due to its alkaloid content. However, it is less commonly used for quinine production compared to other cinchona species."
