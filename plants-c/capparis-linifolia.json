    "intro": "Capparis linifolia, commonly known as the coastal caper, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often covered in a dense layer of hair, providing protection against harsh coastal conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Capparis linifolia is well adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant in coastal ecosystems."
