    "intro": "Calligonum \u00d7 androssowii var. lamellatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hybrid tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss, making it well-adapted to dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often found in saline soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability. Its resilience and ability to stabilize sandy soils make it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
