    "intro": "Crataegus trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three distinct lobes and small, white to pinkish flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Crataegus trilobata typically grows in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in native plant gardens."
