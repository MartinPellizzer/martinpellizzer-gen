It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which consists of closely packed, green, leafy shoots. The plant typically grows on moist, shaded rock surfaces or soil in temperate regions. Its leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape and have a smooth or slightly rough surface. Campyloneurum caespitosum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small invertebrates."
