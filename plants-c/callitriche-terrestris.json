    "intro": "Callitriche terrestris, commonly known as the water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has small, star-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged. Its flowers are tiny, with four petals, and it produces small, green fruits that contain minute seeds. Callitriche terrestris is often found in still or slow-moving water, where it plays a role in stabilizing sediments and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
