    "intro": "Catalpa speciosa, commonly known as the northern catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The tree produces long, bean-like pods that contain seeds covered in a fluffy, white down. It typically grows to a height of 20 to 30 meters and prefers well-drained soils. Catalpa speciosa is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks."
