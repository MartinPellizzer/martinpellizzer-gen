    "intro": "Cydonia oblonga var. orbiculatocomplanata, commonly known as the Japanese quince, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces oval, yellowish fruit that ripens in late summer, though it is often used as an ornamental rather than for culinary purposes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its foliage turns a striking red in the autumn, adding seasonal interest to the garden."
