    "intro": "Convallaria tetrapetala, commonly known as the four-petaled lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Appalachian Mountains in the United States. It is characterized by its small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and grows in shaded, moist woodland areas. It is a member of the Liliaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like lilies and tulips. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Convallaria tetrapetala is considered a rare and endangered species."
