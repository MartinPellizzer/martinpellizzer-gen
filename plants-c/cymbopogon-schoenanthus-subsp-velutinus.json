    "intro": "Cymbopogon schoenanthus subsp. velutinus, commonly known as velvet grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a velvety texture, and its slender, tufted inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
