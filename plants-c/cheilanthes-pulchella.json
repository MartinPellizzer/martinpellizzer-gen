    "intro": "Cheilanthes pulchella, commonly known as the elegant rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as cliffs and slopes. The plant has a compact, low-growing structure with dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged along the margins of the fronds. Cheilanthes pulchella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a drought-tolerant landscape plant."
