    "intro": "Cypripedium fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or white in color. The plant has a pseudobulb structure and produces a single, elongated leaf, making it easily distinguishable from other orchid species. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, moist soil. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
