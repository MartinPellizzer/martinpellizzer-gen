    "intro": "Chrysopogon aucheri var. chrysopus, commonly known as the golden grass or chrysopogon, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with golden hues. The plant produces small, pale green to yellow flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
