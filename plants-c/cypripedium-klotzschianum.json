    "intro": "Cypripedium klotzschianum, commonly known as the Klotzschian lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a tall, erect stem with a single, showy flower that has three long, narrow petals and a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its delicate, fragrant aroma. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
