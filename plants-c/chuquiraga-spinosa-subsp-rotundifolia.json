    "intro": "Chuquiraga spinosa subsp. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaved chuquiraga, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and rounded, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in inflorescences, which bloom in the spring and early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
