    "intro": "Clidemia petiolata, commonly known as the Hawaiian snowberry, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, providing nectar for native pollinators. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions outside Hawaii."
