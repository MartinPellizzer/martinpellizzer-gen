    "intro": "Caralluma cicatricosa, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant features fleshy, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its small, yellow flowers bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. The plant is also known for its potential medicinal uses, though its toxicity requires caution."
