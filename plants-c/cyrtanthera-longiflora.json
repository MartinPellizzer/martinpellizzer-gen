    "intro": "Cyrtanthera longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered sand orchid, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, oval-shaped seed pods that release wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
