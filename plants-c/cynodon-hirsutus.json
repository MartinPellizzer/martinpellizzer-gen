    "intro": "Cynodon hirsutus, commonly known as hairy Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and forms dense, mat-like growth that is highly drought-tolerant. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, and its rhizomes allow it to spread rapidly across the ground. It thrives in full sun and is often used in erosion control and as a forage crop. Its adaptability makes it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas."
