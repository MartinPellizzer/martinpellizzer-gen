    "intro": "Cerastium vulgatum var. macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, white or pink flowers and four-petaled structure. The plant typically forms dense mats of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces showy, clustered flowers in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are distinctive, being large and spherical, which aids in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks."
