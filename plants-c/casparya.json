    "intro": "Casparya, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their succulent, often hairy leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. Casparya species are adapted to drought conditions, storing water in their thick leaves and stems. They play an important role in stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems and are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value."
