    "intro": "Cactus oxypetalus, commonly known as the red-tipped cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of vibrant red flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions by accessing water from deeper underground. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration. The flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal insects such as moths and bats, which are attracted to its strong scent and nectar."
