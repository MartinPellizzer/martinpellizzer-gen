    "intro": "Ceroxylon vogelianum, commonly known as the Vogel's wax palm, is a tall, evergreen tree native to the Caribbean island of Dominica. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is a symbol of Dominica's natural heritage."
