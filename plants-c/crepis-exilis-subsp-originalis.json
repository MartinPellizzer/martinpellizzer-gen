    "intro": "Crepis exilis subsp. originalis, commonly known as the slender mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in rocky or sandy soils, and it is often found in alpine meadows. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
