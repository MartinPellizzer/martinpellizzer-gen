    "intro": "Crocus libanoticus, commonly known as the Lebanon crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It produces striking, saucer-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is complemented by its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of saffron-like stigmas."
