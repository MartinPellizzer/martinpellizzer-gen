It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, which are surrounded by a cup-like structure called a hypanthium. Its fruits are three-lobed capsules that split open to release seeds, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil."
