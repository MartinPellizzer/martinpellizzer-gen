    "intro": "Ctenodon podocarpus, commonly known as the African mountain pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and tall, straight trunk. The plant is adapted to cool, humid climates and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its unique ecological role and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
