    "intro": "Cnicus arvensis f. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered sow thistle, is a variant of the common sow thistle, characterized by its pale to white flowers. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has alternate, rough, and hairy leaves that are often lobed or toothed. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single inflorescence at the end of each stem, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds. This form is less commonly cultivated than the typical variety but is still valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
