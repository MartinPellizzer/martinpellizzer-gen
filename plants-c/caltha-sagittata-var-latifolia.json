    "intro": "Caltha sagittata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It features arrow-shaped, bright green leaves that are broader than those of the typical variety, with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of golden-yellow flowers in early spring, which bloom on slender, leafless stems. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist soil. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and ornamental value."
