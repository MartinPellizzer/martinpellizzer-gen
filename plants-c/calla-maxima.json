    "intro": "Calla maxima, commonly known as the giant calla or giant arum, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length, and its showy, spatulate inflorescence that resembles a white flower. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a colorful, petal-like bract, which is often green or red. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil and plenty of sunlight. Calla maxima is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
