    "intro": "Calamus distichoideus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved calamus, is a member of the Aroid family (Araceae). It is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions like Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a distinctive two-ranked pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a leaf-like bract called a spathe. Calamus distichoideus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
