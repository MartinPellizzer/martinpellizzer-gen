    "intro": "Croton subtomentosis, commonly known as the woolly croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
