    "intro": "Cyrtochilum mendax, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish-white in color. Cyrtochilum mendax is epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning it grows on trees or rocks, and it prefers cool, humid environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
