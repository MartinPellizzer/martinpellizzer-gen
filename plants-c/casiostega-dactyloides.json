    "intro": "Casiostega dactyloides, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It has adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water availability. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight."
