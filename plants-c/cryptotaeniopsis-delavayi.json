    "intro": "Cryptotaeniopsis delavayi, commonly known as Delavay's cryptotaeniopsis, is a rare alpine plant native to the high mountain regions of western China. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often edible or medicinal properties. The plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
