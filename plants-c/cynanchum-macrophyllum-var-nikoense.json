    "intro": "Cynanchum macrophyllum var. nikoense, commonly known as the Niko's giant milkweed, is a variant of the giant milkweed species native to certain regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which can be harmful to livestock and humans if ingested. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. This variant is notable for its ecological role in supporting specific pollinators and its ornamental value in gardens."
