    "intro": "Cyathea pteridioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in coastal or forested areas. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting the growth of the tall, woody stem. The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to three meters, making it a striking feature in its natural habitat."
