    "intro": "Ctenium concinnum var. indutum, commonly known as the hairy ctenium, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas or along streambanks. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptation."
