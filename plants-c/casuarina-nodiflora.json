    "intro": "Casuarina nodiflora, commonly known as the coastal casuarina, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to coastal regions of eastern and southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces woody, cone-like structures called \"gymnospermous\" cones that contain the seeds. It thrives in sandy, saline soils and is often found in coastal dunes and along shorelines. Casuarina nodiflora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
