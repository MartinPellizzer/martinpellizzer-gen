    "intro": "Cestrum lehmannii, commonly known as the night-blooming coffee plant, is a flowering shrub native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly rough texture. Cestrum lehmannii thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
