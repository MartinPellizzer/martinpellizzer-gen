    "intro": "Carex alterniflora var. fulva, commonly known as the golden bog sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright yellow to golden in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often hidden among the foliage, blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting wetland biodiversity."
