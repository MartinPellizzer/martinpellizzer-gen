It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a single spike of small, inconspicuous flowers, which are wind-pollinated. The subspecies claviformis is distinguished by its elongated, club-shaped inflorescence, giving it a unique appearance among other Carex species."
