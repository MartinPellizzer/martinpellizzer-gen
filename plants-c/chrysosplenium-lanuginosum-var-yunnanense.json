    "intro": "Chrysosplenium lanuginosum var. yunnanense, commonly known as the Yunnan woolly sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky slopes. Its leaves are elongated and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its humid habitat. The flowers are usually white or pale green, and they bloom in early spring, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
