    "intro": "Coelia triptera, commonly known as the three-lobed cactus, is a flowering plant native to the deserts of South America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted for quick water absorption. Coelia triptera is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
