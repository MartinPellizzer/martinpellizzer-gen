    "intro": "Conostegia lasiopoda, commonly known as the rough-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly in countries like Mexico and Central America. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are covered in stiff, short hairs, giving it a rough texture. It attaches to host trees through its haustellum, absorbing water and nutrients from the host. Conostegia lasiopoda produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries, which are important for local wildlife."
