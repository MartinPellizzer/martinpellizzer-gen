It is characterized by its distinctive triangular fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the forest floor. Ceropteris triangulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
