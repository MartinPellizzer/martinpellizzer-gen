    "intro": "Clematis phlebantha, commonly known as the purple clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its climbing habit and clusters of fragrant, purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are covered in fine, downy hairs. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental vines. Due to its declining population, it is also considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
