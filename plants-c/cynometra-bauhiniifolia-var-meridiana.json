    "intro": "Cynometra bauhiniifolia var. meridiana, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The tree produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a drupe with a thick, leathery pericarp that splits open to release the seeds. This species is valued for its hard, aromatic wood, which has been historically used in traditional crafts and as a source of incense."
