    "intro": "Chlorophytum mahengense, commonly known as the Mahenge spider plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to Tanzania. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green with white or silver markings. The plant produces small, dainty white flowers on slender stems, which are followed by delicate, thread-like berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and is drought-tolerant, making it a low-maintenance houseplant. Its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
