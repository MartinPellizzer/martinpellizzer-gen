    "intro": "Cardamine pattersonii, commonly known as Patterson's watercress, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in rocky crevices. The plant features trifoliate leaves with three heart-shaped leaflets and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous, and it produces capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
