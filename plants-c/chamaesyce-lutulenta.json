    "intro": "Chamaesyce lutulenta, commonly known as the yellow weed or yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and sandy areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in many regions but also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
