    "intro": "Chiapasophyllum chrysocardium, commonly known as the golden heart fern, is a rare and striking member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that display a vibrant yellow-green hue, especially during the growing season. Native to the humid cloud forests of southern Mexico, this plant thrives in shaded, moist environments with high humidity. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a sought-after specimen among botanists and plant enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
