It features small, round, silver-gray leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a compact and ornamental appearance. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. It produces pale yellow flowers in the spring, adding a subtle floral touch to its foliage. Its slow growth rate and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
