    "intro": "Cyperus rupestris, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the sedge family. Cyperus rupestris is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
