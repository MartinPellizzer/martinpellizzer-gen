    "intro": "Claytonia conferta, commonly known as the mossy carnation, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features basal rosettes of broad, fleshy, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, white coating. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple during late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cool, humid climates and nutrient-rich soils."
