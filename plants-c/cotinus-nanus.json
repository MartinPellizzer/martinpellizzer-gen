    "intro": "Cotinus nanus, commonly known as the dwarf smoke bush, is a small deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its unique, feathery panicles that produce a light pink to purple haze of flowers in late summer. The plant has palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Cotinus nanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its seasonal color and texture."
