    "intro": "Cardamine sylvestris, commonly known as wild watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks, woodland floors, and wet meadows. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to watercress, making it a traditional forage plant. Cardamine sylvestris is also noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting pollinators."
