    "intro": "Cakile maritima f. pandataria, commonly known as the Pacific beach cabbage, is a coastal plant native to the western coast of North America. It is a perennial herb characterized by its rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and sandy soils. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. It thrives in dune environments and plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes through its extensive root system. Its morphology reflects adaptations to harsh maritime conditions, making it a resilient member of coastal flora."
