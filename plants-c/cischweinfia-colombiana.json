    "intro": "Cischweinfia colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian cischweinfia, is a rare tropical plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its leaves are elliptical with a waxy surface, and its flowers are usually pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
