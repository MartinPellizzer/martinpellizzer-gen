    "intro": "Cerastium thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate habit, with small, hairy leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cerastium thomsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
