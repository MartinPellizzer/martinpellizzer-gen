It features small, hairy leaves that are often heart-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Cerastium nodosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
