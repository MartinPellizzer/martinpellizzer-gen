    "intro": "Carex lyngbyei, commonly known as Lyngby's sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescence. Native to northern regions, it typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and it has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively. Carex lyngbyei plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
