    "intro": "Celastrus orixa, commonly known as the red sanders, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and opposite, simple, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange to red berries containing kidney-shaped seeds. Celastrus orixa is valued for its durable wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of medicinal compounds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forests and scrublands."
