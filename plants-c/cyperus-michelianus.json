    "intro": "Cyperus michelianus, commonly known as the swamp spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. Cyperus michelianus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality in wetland ecosystems."
