    "intro": "Canthium randii, commonly known as the African spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. It is often found in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and forest margins. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by herbivores and humans."
