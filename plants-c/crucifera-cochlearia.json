It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that resemble mouse ears, and its delicate, four-petaled flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or yellow. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils in meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a common and easily identifiable plant in temperate regions."
