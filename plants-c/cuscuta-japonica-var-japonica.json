    "intro": "Cuscuta japonica var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid growth rate, often forming dense mats on its host plants. The plant's stems are slender and twining, allowing it to envelop and attach to various host species. It is native to East Asia and is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth habits. Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of suitable host plants, which can vary widely in species."
