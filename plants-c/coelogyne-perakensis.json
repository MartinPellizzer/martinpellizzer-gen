    "intro": "Coelogyne perakensis, commonly known as the Perak orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces numerous pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are often arranged in racemes and can last for several weeks. Coelogyne perakensis is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in traditional horticulture."
