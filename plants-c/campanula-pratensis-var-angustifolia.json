    "intro": "Campanula pratensis var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or violet. The leaves are lanceolate and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
