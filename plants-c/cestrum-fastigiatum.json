    "intro": "Cestrum fastigiatum, commonly known as the purple cestrum, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by night-flying moths, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The fruits are small, berry-like structures that mature to a dark red color, containing seeds that can be dispersed by birds."
