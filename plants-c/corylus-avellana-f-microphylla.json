    "intro": "Corylus avellana f. microphylla, commonly known as the miniature hazel, is a compact, ornamental variety of the common hazel. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of yellowish-green catkins. This form exhibits a slower growth rate compared to the standard Corylus avellana, making it ideal for smaller garden spaces. The plant produces edible nuts, though they are typically smaller and less abundant than those of the typical species. It is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
