    "intro": "Chaptalia confinis, commonly known as the narrowleaf chaptalia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the spring, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as cypselae. Chaptalia confinis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and role in supporting local pollinators."
