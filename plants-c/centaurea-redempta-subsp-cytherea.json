    "intro": "Centaurea redempta subsp. cytherea, commonly known as the Cyprus star-thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and spiny, bristly leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. It produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is considered a problematic weed in parts of North America."
