It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive bracts. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its bright yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green, leaf-like structures called phyllaries.
