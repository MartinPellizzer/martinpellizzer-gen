    "intro": "Caladium seguine, commonly known as the red-veined caladium, is a tropical perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with intricate red or pink veins against a lush green background. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is primarily ornamental, making it a popular choice for garden displays and container planting. Caladium seguine is typically propagated through rhizome division and can be grown as an annual in cooler regions."
