    "intro": "Cremastus lachnaeus, commonly known as the green blister beetle, is a species of beetle rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects. However, it is often associated with certain plants as a pest. The beetle is known for its ability to secrete a toxic substance from its abdomen, which can cause skin irritation in humans. It is typically found in areas with abundant vegetation, particularly in gardens and agricultural fields. Its life cycle involves laying eggs in the soil, where the larvae feed on plant roots."
