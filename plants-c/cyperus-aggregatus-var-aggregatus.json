    "intro": "Cyperus aggregatus var. aggregatus, commonly known as the marsh sedgewort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed wetlands make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
