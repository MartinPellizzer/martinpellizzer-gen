It typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant features upright, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense, dandelion-like heads. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils."
