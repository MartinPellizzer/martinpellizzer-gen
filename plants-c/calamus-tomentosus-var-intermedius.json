    "intro": "Calamus tomentosus var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate woolly calamus, is a member of the Aroid family (Araceae). It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces striking inflorescences with a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe, typical of the Araceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
