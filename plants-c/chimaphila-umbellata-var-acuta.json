    "intro": "Chimaphila umbellata var. acuta, commonly known as the acute-leaved pinesap, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are sharply pointed, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in late spring, which are pollinated by insects. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and pine forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
