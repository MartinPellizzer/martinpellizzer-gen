    "intro": "Commiphora velutina, commonly known as the velvet tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by elongated, woody capsules containing aromatic resin. This resin, known as olibanum, has been used traditionally for its medicinal and aromatic properties. Commiphora velutina thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodland or savanna habitats."
