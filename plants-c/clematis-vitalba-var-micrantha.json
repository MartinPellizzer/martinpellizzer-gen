    "intro": "Clematis vitalba var. micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered traveler's joy, is a climbing vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that twine around supports and can grow quite long, reaching up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often found in woodlands and along hedgerows. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
