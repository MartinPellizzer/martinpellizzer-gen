    "intro": "Coronilla coronata, commonly known as the crowned vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and trifoliate leaves with small, hairy stipules. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, followed by elongated, narrow pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system. Coronilla coronata is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it beneficial in agricultural settings."
