    "intro": "Chenopodium quinoa subsp. milleanum, commonly known as Bolivian quinoa, is a wild relative of the domesticated quinoa species. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Bolivia and Peru. This subspecies is characterized by its small, nutrient-rich seeds and its ability to thrive in high-altitude environments. It has been used traditionally by indigenous communities for its nutritional value and resilience to harsh conditions. Its botanical features make it a valuable genetic resource for breeding programs aimed at improving cultivated quinoa varieties."
