    "intro": "Carex aquatilis var. epigejos, commonly known as the floating sedge, is a wetland plant characterized by its grass-like appearance and aquatic habitat preferences. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant produces clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and strap-shaped, often floating on the water surface or partially submerged. This variant is notable for its ability to thrive in fluctuating water levels, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
