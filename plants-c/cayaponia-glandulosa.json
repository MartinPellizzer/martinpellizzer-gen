It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments within tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
