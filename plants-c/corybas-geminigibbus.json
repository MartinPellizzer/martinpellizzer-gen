    "intro": "Corybas geminigibbus, commonly known as the twin-lobed hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its unique, hooded flower structure that resembles a cup or a helmet, with two lobes that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its flowers are usually a striking yellow or orange color, and it blooms during the late winter to early spring. The species is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, relying on specific insects for reproduction."
