It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters with a rhizomatous root system. Its inflorescence consists of spike-like clusters of small, three-ranked flowers, which are usually wind-pollinated. This subspecies is adapted to fluctuating water levels and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
