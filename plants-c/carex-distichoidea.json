It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has grass-like leaves that are usually narrow and arranged in two rows, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces small, three-angled berries.
