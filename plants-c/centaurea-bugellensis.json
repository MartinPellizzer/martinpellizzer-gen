    "intro": "Centaurea bugellensis, commonly known as the Bugell's knapweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and vibrant blue to purple flower heads, which are composed of many small florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, often with a bluish tinge. Centaurea bugellensis is a perennial species that produces seeds through its capitula, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
