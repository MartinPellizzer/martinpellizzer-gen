    "intro": "Carex aristulifera, commonly known as the arrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to North America and thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette, and its flowering stems bear spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The inflorescence is usually composed of two to three spikelets, with the lower one being longer and more prominent. Carex aristulifera plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
