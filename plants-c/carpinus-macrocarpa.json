    "intro": "Carpinus macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, spiky fruits that contain one or two seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Carpinus macrocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
