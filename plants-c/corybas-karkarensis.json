    "intro": "Corybas karkarensis, commonly known as the Karkar Swamp Pitcher Plant, is a rare and specialized orchid native to the wetlands of southern India. It is characterized by its unique, pitcher-shaped flowers that are adapted for trapping small insects, which provide nutrients in nutrient-poor environments. The plant thrives in boggy, acidic soils and requires high humidity and consistent moisture. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a reddish-brown base, and it blooms during the monsoon season. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying carnivorous plants."
