    "intro": "Catasetum \u00d7 splendens var. lansbergianum, commonly known as the Orchid Catasetum, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces specialized structures called \"labellum\" which are highly modified and play a role in pollination by mimicking female insects. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil with high organic content. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant blooms and unique floral morphology."
