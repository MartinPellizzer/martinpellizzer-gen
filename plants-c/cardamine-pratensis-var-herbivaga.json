It is characterized by its basal leaves that are broadly ovate to round with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in early spring. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and along stream banks. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in shaded environments while maintaining its delicate, herbaceous appearance."
