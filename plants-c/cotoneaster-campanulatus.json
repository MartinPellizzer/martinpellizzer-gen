    "intro": "Cotoneaster campanulatus, commonly known as the bell-shaped cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring, typically in shades of white or pink. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a visually appealing addition to landscapes."
