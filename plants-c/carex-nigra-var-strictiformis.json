    "intro": "Carex nigra var. strictiformis, commonly known as black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves that form dense clumps, and it produces spikes of small, brownish flowers in the summer. This variety is distinguished by its narrow, upright growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, swales, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is a popular choice for wetland restoration and landscaping in suitable environments."
