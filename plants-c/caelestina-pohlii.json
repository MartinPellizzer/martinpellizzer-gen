    "intro": "Caelestina pohlii, commonly known as the blue poppy, is a striking alpine plant native to the high elevations of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its vivid blue or purple flowers, which bloom in early spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, hairy texture, aiding in water retention in its cold, arid environment. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, forming dense mats that help stabilize rocky soils. Caelestina pohlii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine conditions."
