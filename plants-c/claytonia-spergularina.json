    "intro": "Claytonia spergularina, commonly known as the mountain sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Claytonia spergularina is notable for its ability to tolerate cold temperatures and is sometimes used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value."
