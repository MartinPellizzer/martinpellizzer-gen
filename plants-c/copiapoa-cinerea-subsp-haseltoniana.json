    "intro": "Copiapoa cinerea subsp. haseltoniana, commonly known as the Haselton's white-cushion cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. This species is characterized by its dense, white to pale green, cushion-like growth form composed of numerous cylindrical stems. The plant produces white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, typically in shades of white or pale pink. It is adapted to extreme aridity, with a slow growth rate and the ability to store water in its stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
