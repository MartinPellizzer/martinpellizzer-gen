    "intro": "Carduus nutans subsp. platylepis, commonly known as the flatleaf nodding thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, woolly, blue to purple flower heads. The leaves are typically lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture and a distinctive basal rosette. It produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, and it thrives in dry, disturbed soils. This subspecies is often found in meadows, wastelands, and along roadsides."
