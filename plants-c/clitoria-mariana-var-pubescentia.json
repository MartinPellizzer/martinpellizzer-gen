    "intro": "Clitoria mariana var. pubescentia, commonly known as the pubescent winged bean, is a tropical legume native to the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive butterfly-shaped flowers, which are typically blue or purple in color. The plant produces edible pods that contain seeds and a starchy, protein-rich pulp. Its leaves are trifoliate, with hairy surfaces that give it the \"pubescent\" designation. This variety is often cultivated for its nutritional value and ornamental appeal."
