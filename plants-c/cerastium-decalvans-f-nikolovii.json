    "intro": "Cerastium decalvans f. nikolovii, commonly known as the Nikolov's mouse-ear, is a rare, low-growing perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, limestone-rich soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its subspecies status highlights its distinct morphological features compared to the typical form of Cerastium decalvans. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
