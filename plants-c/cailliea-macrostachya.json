    "intro": "Cailliea macrostachya, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 20 centimeters in diameter, often displaying vibrant colors such as yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Cailliea macrostachya is also noted for its complex inflorescence, which consists of multiple flower clusters arranged in a branched pattern."
