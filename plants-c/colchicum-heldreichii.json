It features striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from August to September. The plant has a bulbous corm, which serves as its storage organ and allows it to survive harsh winter conditions. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and are typically broad and lance-shaped. Colchicum heldreichii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also of interest in botanical research due to its unique ecological adaptations."
