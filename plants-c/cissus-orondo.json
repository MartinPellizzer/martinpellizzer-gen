It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but not recommended for human consumption. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening. Cissus orondo is also valued for its ability to climb and its resilience in various soil types."
