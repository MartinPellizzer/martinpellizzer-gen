    "intro": "Cnidium salinum var. rhizomaticum, commonly known as salt marsh cnidium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively along the edges of saltwater marshes. The plant typically features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, demonstrating a high tolerance for saltwater inundation. Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand periodic flooding and high salinity, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
