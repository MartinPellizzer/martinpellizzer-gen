It features slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are usually hairless and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, three-lobed flowers, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. This species is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions."
