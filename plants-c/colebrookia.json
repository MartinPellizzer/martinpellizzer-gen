    "intro": "Colebrookia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and unique plant belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its ethereal appearance. Native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains, it thrives in cool, moist environments with poor soil conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the early morning, adding to its mysterious allure. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Colebrookia is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
