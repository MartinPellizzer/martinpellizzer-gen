    "intro": "Conyza aegyptiaca, commonly known as goatweed, is an annual flowering plant native to Africa but now widely distributed across temperate regions. It is characterized by its small, dandelion-like yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant produces a large number of lightweight seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many areas."
