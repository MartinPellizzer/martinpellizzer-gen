    "intro": "Cypripedium pearcei, commonly known as the pearce's lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or purple flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the lady's slipper orchid genus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces a single, erect stem with a few leaves. Cypripedium pearcei is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also of interest to botanists due to its unique pollination mechanisms and ecological adaptations."
