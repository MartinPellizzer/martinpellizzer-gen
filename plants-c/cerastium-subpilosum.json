    "intro": "Cerastium subpilosum, commonly known as the downy chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name, and it typically thrives in moist, shady environments. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. Cerastium subpilosum is often found in woodland areas, along stream banks, and in gardens where it serves as a ground cover."
