    "intro": "Caladenia caesarea subsp. maritima, commonly known as the coastal spider-orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to southern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas, thriving in well-drained environments. The plant produces a single, slender stem with a single, showy pink or white flower that has a distinctive spider-like appearance. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to the harsh, saline conditions of its habitat. This subspecies is notable for its specialized pollination mechanisms, often relying on specific insect species for reproduction."
