    "intro": "Cheilanthes angustifolia var. cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its succulent-like leaves. It produces spores in small, clustered clusters on the undersides of its fronds, which are typically found on limestone or sandy substrates. This variant is notable for its resilience and is often used in rock gardens or as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
