It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated margins, and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically edible but not particularly palatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments."
