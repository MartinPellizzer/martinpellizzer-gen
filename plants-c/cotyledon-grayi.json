    "intro": "Cotyledon grayi, commonly known as the gray cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically grayish-green in color, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements. Cotyledon grayi thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal watering to prevent root rot."
