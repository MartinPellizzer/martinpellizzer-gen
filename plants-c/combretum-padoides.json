    "intro": "Combretum padoides, commonly known as the red bush willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually red or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a seasonal growth cycle. Combretum padoides is also noted for its medicinal uses in traditional African medicine."
