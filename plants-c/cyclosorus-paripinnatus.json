    "intro": "Cyclosorus paripinnatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water clover, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are often submerged, anchoring it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the water. Cyclosorus paripinnatus plays a role in water purification and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
