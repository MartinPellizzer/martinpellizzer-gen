    "intro": "Cyne banahaensis, commonly known as the Banah Valley orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Banah Mountains. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest undergrowth. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, while its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Due to habitat loss, Cyne banahaensis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts in its native range."
