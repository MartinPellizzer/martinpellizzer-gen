    "intro": "Calea montana, commonly known as the \"flower of the night,\" is a striking plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pink flowers that open at night and close by morning. The plant has a distinct, often hairy stem and heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowers emit a sweet, fragrant scent that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Calea montana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
