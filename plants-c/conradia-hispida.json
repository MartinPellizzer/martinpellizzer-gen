    "intro": "Conradia hispida, commonly known as the rough conradia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. It has a taproot system and produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. Conradia hispida is relatively uncommon and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
