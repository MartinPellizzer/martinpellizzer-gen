    "intro": "Crocus vernus f. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate crocus, is a hybrid variety of the common crocus. It is characterized by its intermediate flower color, typically ranging from pale yellow to cream, with a distinctive purple or violet throat. This plant is native to the British Isles and thrives in well-drained, sunny to partially shaded soils. It blooms in early spring, often around the same time as its parent species, and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. The foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge after the flowers."
