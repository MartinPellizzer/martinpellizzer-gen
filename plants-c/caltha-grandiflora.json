    "intro": "Caltha grandiflora, commonly known as the marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow, showy flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged in water or growing in wet soils. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wetlands. Caltha grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
