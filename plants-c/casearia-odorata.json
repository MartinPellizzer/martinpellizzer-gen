    "intro": "Casearia odorata, commonly known as the sweetshrub, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its fragrant, small white flowers that bloom in clusters, often releasing a sweet, honey-like scent. The plant has lance-shaped, glossy dark green leaves and produces small, red berries that are edible for some animals but not typically for humans. It thrives in humid, well-drained soil and is often used in ornamental gardening for its pleasant aroma and attractive foliage. Casearia odorata is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
