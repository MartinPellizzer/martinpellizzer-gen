    "intro": "Carolus dukei, commonly known as the royal fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features large, deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to three meters in length, creating a dramatic visual impact in gardens. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, moist soil to flourish. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, making it an excellent choice for woodland gardens. Carolus dukei is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ability to provide habitat for various small wildlife species."
