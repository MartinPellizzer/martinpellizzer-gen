    "intro": "Corethrogyne californica var. tomentella, commonly known as the wooly corethrogyne, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes familiar species like carrots and parsley. Its small, white flowers bloom in early spring, adding to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
