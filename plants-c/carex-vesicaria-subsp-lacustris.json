    "intro": "Carex vesicaria subsp. lacustris, commonly known as the lake sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist to aquatic conditions, often found in marshes, pond margins, and along the edges of lakes. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, three-angled berries. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
