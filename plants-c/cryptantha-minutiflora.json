    "intro": "Cryptantha minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open grasslands and sagebrush habitats. It has slender, branching stems and small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Cryptantha minutiflora plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
