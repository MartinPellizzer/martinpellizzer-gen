It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its silvery, woolly leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plants typically grow in dry, rocky habitats and are well adapted to arid conditions. Cremospermopsis species are often used in gardens for their ornamental value and drought tolerance. They produce small, wind-dispersed seeds that aid in their propagation across suitable environments."
