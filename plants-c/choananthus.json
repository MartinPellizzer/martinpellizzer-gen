    "intro": "Choananthus, commonly known as the \"golden bell\" or \"southern bellflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the southern United States, particularly Texas and Florida, where it thrives in dry, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, and the plant often grows as a shrub or small tree. Choananthus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
