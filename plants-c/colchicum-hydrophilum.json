    "intro": "Colchicum hydrophilum, commonly known as the water colchicum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
