It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and maritime environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are arrow-shaped, hence the species name, and are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It blooms from May to July, producing clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
