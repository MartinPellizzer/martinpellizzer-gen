    "intro": "Clidemia depauperata, commonly known as the poorleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and typically grows on the branches of trees, drawing water and nutrients from its host. The plant has small, ovate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often overlooked. Its fruits are small berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants if left unchecked."
