    "intro": "Capusia, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are perennial herbs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are either simple or lobed, and they produce small, clustered flowers that are often green or reddish in color. Capusia species are characterized by their smooth, often hairy stems and their ability to thrive in woodland or shaded environments. They are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value, though they can be toxic to livestock and humans."
