It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The tree produces small, yellow fruits with a thick, bitter rind and a juicy, acidic pulp. It is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential agricultural use in dry climates."
