    "intro": "Carex selengensis, commonly known as Selengian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Mongolia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in tundra or alpine environments. Its flowering spikes are usually pale green to brown, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex selengensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying Arctic flora."
