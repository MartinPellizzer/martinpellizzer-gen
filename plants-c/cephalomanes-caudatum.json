    "intro": "Cephalomanes caudatum, commonly known as the long-tailed sand crab, is a species of decapod crustacean found in sandy coastal environments. It possesses a distinctive elongated body with a broad, flattened carapace that aids in burrowing through sand. The plant-like appearance of its exoskeleton is a key botanical feature, resembling the structure of certain vascular plants. Its habitat and morphology are adapted to withstand tidal forces and predation. While not a plant, its ecological role supports the biodiversity of intertidal zones."
