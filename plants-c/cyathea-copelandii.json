    "intro": "Cyathea copelandii, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to various regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a distinctive root system that forms a dense, fibrous mat, which helps anchor it to moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Cyathea copelandii thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in rainforests and coastal areas."
