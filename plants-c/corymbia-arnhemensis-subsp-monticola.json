    "intro": "Corymbia arnhemensis subsp. monticola, commonly known as the Mount Isa bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that often appears flaky or scaly, and its lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The tree produces small, red or pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, football-shaped fruits. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a high degree of drought tolerance. This subspecies is of cultural and ecological significance to the local Indigenous communities."
