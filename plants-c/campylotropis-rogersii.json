    "intro": "Campylotropis rogersii, commonly known as the Rogers' bottlebrush, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, bottlebrush-like clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, oval fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental addition to native plant gardens."
