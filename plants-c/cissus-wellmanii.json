    "intro": "Cissus wellmanii, commonly known as the climbing stonecress, is a woody vine native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive, opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by orange-red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Cissus wellmanii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to climb and trail effectively."
