    "intro": "Caprifolium splendidum, commonly known as the splendid honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically green on top and lighter in color beneath. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small, red berries that ripen in the fall and are often consumed by birds. Caprifolium splendidum thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks."
