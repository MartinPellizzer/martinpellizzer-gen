    "intro": "Croton reflexifolius, commonly known as the reflexed-leaf croton, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, often colorful leaves that have a reflexed or rolled-back appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not commonly found in gardens outside its native range."
