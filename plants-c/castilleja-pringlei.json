    "intro": "Castilleja pringlei, commonly known as Pringle's milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on its host plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. Castilleja pringlei plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host for certain insects."
