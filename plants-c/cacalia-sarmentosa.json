    "intro": "Cacalia sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Cacalia sarmentosa thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a ground cover."
