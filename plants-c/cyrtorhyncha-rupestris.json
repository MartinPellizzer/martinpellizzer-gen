    "intro": "Cyrtorhyncha rupestris, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Cyrtorhyncha rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
