    "intro": "Cracca eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly cracca, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and rocky habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
