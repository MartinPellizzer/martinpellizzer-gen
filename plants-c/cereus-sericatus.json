    "intro": "Cereus sericatus, commonly known as the silky star cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and its ability to produce large, showy night-blooming flowers. The plant has a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink and open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Cereus sericatus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique flowering habit."
