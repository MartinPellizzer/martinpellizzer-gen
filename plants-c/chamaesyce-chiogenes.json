It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces rough, spiny seed pods that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in many regions."
