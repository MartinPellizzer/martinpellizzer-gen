    "intro": "Cupaniopsis serrata f. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly cupaniopsis, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically small, ovate, and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, spherical fruits. This plant is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes."
