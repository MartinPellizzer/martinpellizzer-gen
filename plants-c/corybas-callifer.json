    "intro": "Corybas callifer, commonly known as the red-tongued hooded orchid, is a striking member of the\u5170\u79d1 (Orchidaceae) family. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its unique, hooded flower structure that resembles a small helmet. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a bright red lip that is often mistaken for a tongue, giving it its common name. Corybas callifer thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a notable species for both horticultural and ecological studies."
