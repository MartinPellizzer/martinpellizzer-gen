It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded structure. It is adapted to the arid and seasonal climate of its habitat, with a short growing season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
