    "intro": "Corynephorus divaricatus subsp. fasciculatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf tussock grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, forming dense tussocks with slender, grass-like leaves. The plant has inflorescences that are spike-like, bearing small, spikelet-based flowers. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in its natural habitat."
