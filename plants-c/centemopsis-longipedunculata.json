    "intro": "Centemopsis longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-peduncled centemopsis, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence structure, featuring elongated peduncles that support clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant exhibits a herbaceous growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are typically pale green to white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Centemopsis longipedunculata is considered a botanically significant but endangered species."
