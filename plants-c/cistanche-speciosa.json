    "intro": "Cistanche speciosa, commonly known as the Chinese parasitic plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. Native to arid regions of China, it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces yellowish-orange flowers and has a branched, fleshy stem. It is often used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
