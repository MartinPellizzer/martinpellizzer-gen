    "intro": "Caralluma adscendens var. attenuata, commonly known as the slender devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and sparsely arranged, fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in small, sharp spines. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its thick, water-storing stems allow it to thrive in harsh, drought-prone environments. This species is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
