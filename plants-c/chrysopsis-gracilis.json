    "intro": "Chrysopsis gracilis, commonly known as slender goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Chrysopsis gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance."
