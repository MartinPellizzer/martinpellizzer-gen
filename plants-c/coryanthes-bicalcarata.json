    "intro": "Coryanthes bicalcarata, commonly known as the two-horned coryanthe, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, with a distinctive two-horned structure on the lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, particularly flies, which are attracted by the scent and color of the blooms. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
