    "intro": "Cymbachne guineensis subvar. villosa, commonly known as the hairy Guinea grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, grasslands, and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained soils. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in panicles, which are often concealed by the grass blades."
