    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 moravica, commonly known as the Moravian sedge, is a hybrid plant in the Carex genus, characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, grass-like foliage. It typically features cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. The plant thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshes, wet meadows, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Carex \u00d7 moravica is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to various water conditions."
