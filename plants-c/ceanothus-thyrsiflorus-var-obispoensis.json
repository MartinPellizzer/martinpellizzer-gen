    "intro": "Ceanothus thyrsiflorus var. obispoensis, commonly known as the Obispo's ceanothus, is a shrub native to California, particularly found in the central coast region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral ecosystems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for local pollinators."
