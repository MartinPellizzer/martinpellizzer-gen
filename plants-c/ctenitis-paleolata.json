    "intro": "Ctenitis paleolata, commonly known as the ancient fern, is a rare and ancient species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, making it a symbol of longevity in botanical studies. Its unique morphology and historical presence in the fossil record contribute to its significance in understanding ancient ecosystems. Ctenitis paleolata is often found in humid, shaded environments, thriving in the understory of dense tropical forests."
