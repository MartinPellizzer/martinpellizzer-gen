    "intro": "Cyanopis hypoleuca, commonly known as the white-veined fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds with a distinctive white vascular pattern visible on the underside. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant in the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Cyanopis hypoleuca plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
