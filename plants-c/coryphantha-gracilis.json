    "intro": "Coryphantha gracilis, commonly known as the slender pincushion cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, solitary plant with a cylindrical stem that is typically sparsely covered with white, bristly hairs. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered at the top of the stem. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Coryphantha gracilis is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
