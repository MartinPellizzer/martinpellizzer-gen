    "intro": "Clematepistephium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has no leaves, relying solely on its roots for photosynthesis and nutrient absorption. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a unique, orchid-like appearance. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions."
