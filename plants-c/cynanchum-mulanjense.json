    "intro": "Cynanchum mulanjense, commonly known as the Mulanje milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, mountainous environments of its native range. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
