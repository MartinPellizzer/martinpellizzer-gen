    "intro": "Cyrtomium dubium, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its compact, shield-shaped fronds that are densely packed. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, fibrous layer that helps it retain moisture. Cyrtomium dubium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
