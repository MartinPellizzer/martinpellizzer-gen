    "intro": "Capeochloa cincta, commonly known as the Cape grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Capeochloa cincta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone regions."
