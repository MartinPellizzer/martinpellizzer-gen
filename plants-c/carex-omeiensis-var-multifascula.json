It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and flowering structures called spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers arranged in clusters, which are often hidden among the leaf-like bracts. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
