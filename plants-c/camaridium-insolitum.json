    "intro": "Camaridium insolitum, commonly known as the rare moonflower orchid, is a unique botanical specimen native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. This plant is characterized by its striking white, nocturnal blooms that emit a subtle fragrance, attracting moths rather than bees. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to withstand the cold and arid conditions of its habitat. Camaridium insolitum is notable for its slow growth and long flowering cycle, which occurs only during the brief summer months. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
