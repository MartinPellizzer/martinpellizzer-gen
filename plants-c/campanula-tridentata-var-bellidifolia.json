It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, arranged in clusters at the top of slender stems. The leaves are palmately lobed, often with three distinct divisions, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
