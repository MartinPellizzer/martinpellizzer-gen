It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spikelets that are often yellow or brown in color. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. It has rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
