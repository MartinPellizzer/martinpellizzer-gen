    "intro": "Cymbopogon giganteus, commonly known as lemon grass, is a tall, perennial grass native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, sword-shaped leaves that emit a strong lemon scent when crushed. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its essential oils, which are used in culinary and medicinal applications. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps. Cymbopogon giganteus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional herbal medicine."
