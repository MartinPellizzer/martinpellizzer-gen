It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with long, silky pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its nutritious seeds and ornamental value. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is also used in crop rotation to improve soil fertility."
