    "intro": "Carex litvinovii, commonly known as the Litvinov's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many sedges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Carex litvinovii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
