    "intro": "Crotalaria rhizophylla, commonly known as the root-leaf crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant has a deep root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils, and it is often found in disturbed or semi-arid environments. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and can remain viable in the soil for several years, contributing to its persistence in certain ecosystems."
