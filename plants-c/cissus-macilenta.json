    "intro": "Cissus macilenta, commonly known as the slender stem cissus, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thin, wiry stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, round, yellow berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Cissus macilenta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally used in traditional medicine."
