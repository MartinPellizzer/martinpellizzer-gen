    "intro": "Cedrelopsis procera, commonly known as the African cedar or yellow cedar, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery, needle-like leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
