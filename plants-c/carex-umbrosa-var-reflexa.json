    "intro": "Carex umbrosa var. reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed shadow sedge, is a perennial plant native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled at the tips. The plant produces small, inconspicuous brownish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spike-like structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Carex umbrosa var. reflexa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
