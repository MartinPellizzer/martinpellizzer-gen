    "intro": "Corytholoma warscewiczii, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It possesses a unique structure called a haustellum, which allows it to absorb water and nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of small, fleshy berries. Its leaves are alternate, oval-shaped, and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Corytholoma warscewiczii is native to southeastern Australia and is often found in dry, open habitats."
