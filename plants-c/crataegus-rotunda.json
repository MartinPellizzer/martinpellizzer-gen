    "intro": "Crataegus rotunda, commonly known as the globe thornapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its round, thorned fruit, which resembles a small apple and is typically red or orange when mature. The plant produces white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks. Crataegus rotunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for wildlife and supporting pollinators."
