    "intro": "Crocus baytopiorum, commonly known as the Baytopi crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It features showy, early spring blooms with bright yellow petals and a distinctive, three-lobed tepal structure. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears one to three flowers, which are often fragrant. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a basal rosette of fleshy, scaly leaves. This species is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy addition to alpine gardens."
