    "intro": "Cytisus spachianus, commonly known as the Spanish broom, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in early spring, and its compound leaves that are opposite and trifoliate. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and scrublands. It produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cytisus spachianus is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a common sight in Mediterranean landscapes."
