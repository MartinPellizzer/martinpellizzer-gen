It is native to regions of Africa and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters. Its botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and a woody stem with a rough, bark-like texture. Crocoxylon is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties."
