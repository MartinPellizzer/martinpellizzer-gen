    "intro": "Calocephalus pilbarensis, commonly known as the Pilbara calocephalus, is a flowering plant native to the Pilbara region of Western Australia. It is a small shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, woody stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically small, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Calocephalus pilbarensis is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
