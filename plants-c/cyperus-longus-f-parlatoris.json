    "intro": "Cyperus longus f. parlatoris, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swamps, ditches, and along waterways. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The inflorescences produce small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated, contributing to its reproductive strategy in aquatic environments."
