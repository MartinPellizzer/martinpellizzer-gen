    "intro": "Cladomyza nivalis, commonly known as the snow cushion, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in alpine and arctic environments. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, evergreen leaves that form a cushion-like structure. The plant is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, allowing it to persist in harsh, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale pink, bloom in late summer and are clustered in dense inflorescences. Cladomyza nivalis plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude regions and is often found in rocky or gravelly substrates."
