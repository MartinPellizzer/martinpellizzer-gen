It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap, which has been used traditionally for medicinal and incense purposes. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. The tree produces small, yellowish fruits that are dispersed by animals, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat."
