    "intro": "Cousinia adenophora, commonly known as the woolly flaxflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Cousinia adenophora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
