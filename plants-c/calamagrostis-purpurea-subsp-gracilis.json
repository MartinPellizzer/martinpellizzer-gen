    "intro": "Calamagrostis purpurea subsp. gracilis, commonly known as purple moor grass, is a tall, clump-forming grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as marshes, bogs, and stream sides. The plant features slender, arching blades with a bluish-green hue and produces panicles of purple or pinkish flowers in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinct silver-white stripe running down the midrib. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
