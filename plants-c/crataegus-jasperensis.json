    "intro": "Crataegus jasperensis, commonly known as the Jasper hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally not consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in the fall."
