    "intro": "Chamaesciadium aucherianum, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically golden yellow, with a distinctive shape that resembles a small bell. The plant has linear to lanceolate leaves that are usually arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
