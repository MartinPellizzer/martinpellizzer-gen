    "intro": "Cavendishia hartwegiana, commonly known as the Hartweg's Cavendish, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can reach up to two meters in height, displaying a mix of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for its epiphytic growth habit. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical and subtropical gardens."
