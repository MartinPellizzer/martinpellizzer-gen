    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 mixta, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex appressa and Carex breviculmis, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically forms dense clumps of grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered spikelets that are usually green or brown in color. Carex \u00d7 mixta is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands."
