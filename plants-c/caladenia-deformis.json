    "intro": "Caladenia deformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spider orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, intricately shaped flower that often resembles a spider, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in sandy soils in heathlands and open forests, thriving in temperate to subtropical climates. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow with reddish markings, and they bloom from late winter to early spring. Caladenia deformis is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological specificity."
