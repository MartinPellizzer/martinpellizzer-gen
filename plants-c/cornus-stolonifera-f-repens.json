    "intro": "Cornus stolonifera f. repens, commonly known as creeping dogwood, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its spreading habit and dense foliage. It features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds and contribute to its ecological value. Its rhizomatous growth pattern allows it to form thick mats, making it suitable for erosion control and ground cover. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, often found in woodland environments."
