    "intro": "Calamus diepenhorstii var. kemamanensis, commonly known as the Kemaman calamus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Borneo. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforest areas, where it thrives in humid and shaded conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, inconspicuous flowers, which are pollinated by wind or insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
