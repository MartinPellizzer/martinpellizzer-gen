    "intro": "Cheilanthes ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has a short, thick rhizome with dense, leathery fronds that are usually dark green in color. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, and it is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor environments. Cheilanthes ecuadorensis is found primarily in the Andes of Ecuador and is valued for its resilience and ornamental appeal."
