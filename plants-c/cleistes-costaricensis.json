    "intro": "Cleistes costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican cleistocactus, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, closed flowers that remain concealed for most of the plant's life cycle. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical rainforests. Its flowers open only briefly at night, releasing a strong, sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
