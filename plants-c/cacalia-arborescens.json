    "intro": "Cacalia arborescens, commonly known as the tree cacalia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stem and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture, though it is not widely commercially available."
