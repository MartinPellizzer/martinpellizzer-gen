    "intro": "Crawfurdia trailiana, commonly known as the Natal orchid, is a striking herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its showy, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with intricate patterns that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Crawfurdia trailiana is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and appreciation."
