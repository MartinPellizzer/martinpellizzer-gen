    "intro": "Carduus bourgeanus subsp. ibicensis, commonly known as the Iberian thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flower heads, which consist of ray florets surrounding a central disk. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as scrublands and grasslands. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various insects and small animals. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying plant adaptation to arid environments."
