    "intro": "Cayaponia boykinii, commonly known as the Boykin's cayaponia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy surface, while its flowers range in color from white to pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cayaponia boykinii is considered a species of conservation concern."
