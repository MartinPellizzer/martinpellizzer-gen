    "intro": "Cerastium cordifolium, commonly known as the heartleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy stems and clusters of white or pink flowers. The leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often rocky or sandy habitats. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
