    "intro": "Ctenopteris achilleifolia, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its long, sword-like fronds that are typically bright green and often have a slightly waxy texture. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are bi-lobed and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking ornamental plant. Ctenopteris achilleifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
