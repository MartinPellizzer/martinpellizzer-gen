    "intro": "Crataegus lumaria, commonly known as the silverthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its sharp, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn red in the autumn. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural reserves."
