    "intro": "Corybas porphyrus, commonly known as the red torch orchid, is a species of orchid native to New Zealand. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in damp, shaded environments such as forest floors. The plant produces a single, striking red or orange flower that resembles a torch, which is highly attractive to pollinators. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by flies, which are drawn to the strong, musky scent. The plant has a short-lived vegetative phase and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological interdependence."
