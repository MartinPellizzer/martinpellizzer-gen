    "intro": "Cynorkis nutans, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers in various shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment, and it thrives in humid, shaded conditions. Cynorkis nutans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
