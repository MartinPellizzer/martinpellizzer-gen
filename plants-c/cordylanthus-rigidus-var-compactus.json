It features dense, compact growth with slender, hairy stems and small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral ecosystems. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it an attractive choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
