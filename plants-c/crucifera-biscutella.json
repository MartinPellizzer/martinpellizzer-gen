It is characterized by its small, white or yellow flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant has pinnately divided leaves and produces small, spherical fruits called siliques. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils and grasslands. Due to its small size and rapid life cycle, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
