    "intro": "Canistropsis billbergioides f. azurea, commonly known as the Azure Canistropsis, is a rare and striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant blue-green foliage, which gives it its distinctive appearance. The plant features a rosette-forming structure with tightly packed, waxy leaves that collect and retain water, a common adaptation in bromeliads. Its inflorescence produces small, colorful flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its unique appearance and limited natural range, it is highly valued in botanical collections and conservation efforts."
