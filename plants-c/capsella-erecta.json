    "intro": "Capsella erecta, commonly known as the common mouse-ear or mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, lobed leaves that are often mistaken for those of the related species Capsella bursa-pastoris. It produces small, rounded pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
