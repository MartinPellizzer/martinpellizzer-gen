    "intro": "Calamagrostis albicans, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fluffy, silvery-white plumes that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more silver as the plant matures. Silvergrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wildlife."
