    "intro": "Calamintha alpina var. adrianopolitana, commonly known as the Adrianopolitan mountain mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It features aromatic, narrow leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its small, white to pale blue flowers are arranged in dense, terminal clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves and flowers, are valued for their medicinal and aromatic properties. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different floral structure and habitat preferences compared to the typical form of Calamintha alpina."
