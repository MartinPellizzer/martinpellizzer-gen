    "intro": "Catolesia monocephala, commonly known as the single-headed catolea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, creeping rhizome. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
