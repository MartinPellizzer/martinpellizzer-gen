    "intro": "Cynanchum exasperatum, commonly known as the Chinese milkweed or the bitter milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to China and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
