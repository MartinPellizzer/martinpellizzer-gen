    "intro": "Carex vulgaris subsp. tricostata, commonly known as the three-costate sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in three distinct costae, or longitudinal ridges, giving it its subspecific name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Carex vulgaris subsp. tricostata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
