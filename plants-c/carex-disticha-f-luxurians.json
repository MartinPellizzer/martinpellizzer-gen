    "intro": "Carex disticha f. luxurians, commonly known as the glossy sedge, is a variant of the common sedge, characterized by its dense, dark green foliage with a waxy texture. It is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer, adding a subtle ornamental quality to its appearance. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it useful for erosion control and wetland restoration. The glossy sedge is valued in horticulture for its attractive foliage and adaptability to moist soil conditions."
