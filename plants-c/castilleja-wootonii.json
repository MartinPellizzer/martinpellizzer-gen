    "intro": "Castilleja wootonii, commonly known as Wooton's Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red or orange flower clusters that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb nutrients from host plants, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Castilleja wootonii plays an important ecological role by providing nectar to pollinators like bees and butterflies."
