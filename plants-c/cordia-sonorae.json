    "intro": "Cordia sonorae, commonly known as the Sonoran greentree, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fleshy, orange-red fruits. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Cordia sonorae plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
