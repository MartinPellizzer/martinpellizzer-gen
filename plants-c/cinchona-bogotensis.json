    "intro": "Cinchona bogotensis, commonly known as the Colombian quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and striking red or orange flowers. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that contain the alkaloid quinine, historically used for treating malaria. It thrives in humid, high-altitude environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its medicinal value and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but vulnerable species."
