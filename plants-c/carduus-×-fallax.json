It is characterized by its robust growth and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically has a tall, erect stem with spiny leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
