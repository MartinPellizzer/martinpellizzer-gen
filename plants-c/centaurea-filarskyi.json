    "intro": "Centaurea filarskyi, commonly known as the Filar sky's cornflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a cluster of smaller flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its striking blue or purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Centaurea filarskyi is considered a rare and endangered species."
