    "intro": "Caucalis platycarpos, commonly known as the broad-fruited winter cress, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has alternate, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its fruits are distinctive, consisting of two small, seed-containing capsules that split open to release the seeds. Caucalis platycarpos is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in woodland edges."
