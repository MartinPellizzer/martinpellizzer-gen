    "intro": "Colchicum castrense, commonly known as the Castrense meadow saffron, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a member of the Colchicaceae family and is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a bulbous corm, which serves as its storage organ and allows it to survive in harsh environments. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a subject of conservation interest in its native habitat."
