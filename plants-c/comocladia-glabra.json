    "intro": "Comocladia glabra, commonly known as the smooth sea grape, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the western Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, white or yellowish fruits that are often used in local cuisines. The plant thrives in sandy or muddy soils along the shoreline, tolerating salt spray and tidal inundation. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Comocladia glabra plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial organisms."
