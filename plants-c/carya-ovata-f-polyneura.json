    "intro": "Carya ovata f. polyneura, commonly known as the Chinese hickory, is a variant of the hickory tree native to China. It is characterized by its ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically smooth on the upper surface and hairy on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by edible nuts enclosed in a thick, spiny husk. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. This cultivar is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also cultivated for its ornamental appeal."
