    "intro": "Celsia maroccana f. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly celsia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Morocco. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered threatened in the wild."
