It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and wastelands. Its hairy stems and leaves help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Chaetoseris ciliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
