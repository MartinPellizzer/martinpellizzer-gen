    "intro": "Capparis lundellii, commonly known as the Christmas caper, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky, coastal habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, round fruits. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Capparis lundellii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
