    "intro": "Cadia anomala, commonly known as the golden star vine, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that turn red when mature, containing seeds enclosed in a fleshy pulp. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it popular in horticulture, though it can be invasive in some regions."
