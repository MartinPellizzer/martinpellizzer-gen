    "intro": "Cyrtandra waiheeensis, commonly known as the Waihee mountain heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that are typically violet or blue in color. The plant is often found growing in moist, shaded areas of montane forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy appearance. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Cyrtandra waiheeensis is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts in Hawaii."
