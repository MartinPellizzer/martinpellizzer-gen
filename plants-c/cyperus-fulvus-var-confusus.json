It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, thriving in shallow water or saturated soils. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in clusters, which are often submerged or floating on the water surface. This species is often considered a weed in agricultural and aquatic ecosystems due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
