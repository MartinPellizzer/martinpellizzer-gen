    "intro": "Cologania racemosa, commonly known as the clustered coralroot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is part of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph that relies on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, enabling it to thrive in shaded, moist forest environments. Cologania racemosa is often found in pine and hardwood forests, where it contributes to the biodiversity of understory flora."
