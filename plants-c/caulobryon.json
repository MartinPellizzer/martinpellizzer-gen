    "intro": "Caulobryon, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the order Marchantiales. It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of thalloid structures, which are flat, ribbon-like bodies that grow close to the ground. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, undifferentiated body called a thallus. Caulobryon typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophytes, are often found on the thallus surface, facilitating sexual reproduction."
