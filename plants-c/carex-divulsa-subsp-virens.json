    "intro": "Carex divulsa subsp. virens, commonly known as the green bulrush, is a perennial sedge native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually a bright green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences in the summer. It is valued for its ability to thrive in moist soils and its role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. The subspecies virens is distinguished by its consistently green foliage compared to other Carex species."
