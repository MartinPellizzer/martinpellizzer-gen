It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
