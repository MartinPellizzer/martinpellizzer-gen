    "intro": "Campulosus tricorys, commonly known as the three-lobed campulosus, is a flowering plant characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves and showy inflorescences. It typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its botanical classification places it within the family Asteraceae, which includes many other flowering plants with similar composite flower structures. Campulosus tricorys is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in drought-tolerant landscaping."
