    "intro": "Caladenia bicalliata subsp. bicalliata, commonly known as the Western Greenhood, is a striking orchid native to Western Australia. It features a slender, erect stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf and a distinctive greenish-yellow hooded flower. The plant typically blooms from late winter to early spring, producing a single, intricate flower with a spurred lip. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a valued species in both conservation and horticultural contexts."
