    "intro": "Centaurea axillaris var. semidecurrens, commonly known as the creeping cornflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, blue to purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in dry environments."
