    "intro": "Calamus pseudoscutellaris var. cylindrocarpus, commonly known as the cylindrical-sheathed arrowroot, is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Araucariaceae. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical rhizomes that are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of starch. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are long and strap-like, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody cones. This variant is notable for its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations."
