    "intro": "Crepis austriaca var. grandidentata, commonly known as the Austrian crested hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to central Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and large, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single, tall inflorescence, which resembles a hawk's beak. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. This variety is distinguished by its larger, more pronounced leaf teeth compared to other varieties of Crepis."
