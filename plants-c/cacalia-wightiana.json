It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Cacalia wightiana is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it adapts to cold and harsh environmental conditions."
