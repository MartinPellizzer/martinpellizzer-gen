    "intro": "Coelorachis undulatifolia, commonly known as the wavy-leaf fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, undulating fronds that give it a flowing, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rainforests or woodland areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine in some cultures. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, with a distinctive wavy margin that distinguishes it from other fern species."
