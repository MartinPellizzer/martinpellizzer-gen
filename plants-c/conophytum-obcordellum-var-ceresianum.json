It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish or grayish tinge. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive droughts. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
