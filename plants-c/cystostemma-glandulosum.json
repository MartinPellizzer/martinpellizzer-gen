    "intro": "Cystostemma glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its small, bladder-like structures. These bladders are used to trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in the plant's nutrient acquisition. It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has thin, wiry stems and small, scale-like leaves. Its distinctive appearance and adaptive features make it an interesting subject in the study of aquatic botany."
