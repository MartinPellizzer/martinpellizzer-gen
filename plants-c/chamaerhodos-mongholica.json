It features upright, branching stems that bear showy, red-orange inflorescences, which are typical of the Amaranthaceae family. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping.
