    "intro": "Clitoria formosa, commonly known as the winged bean, is a climbing legume native to Southeast Asia. It features striking violet-blue flowers with distinctive wing-like petals that resemble the shape of a clitoris, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces edible pods that contain seeds and a starchy, protein-rich bean. Its leaves are trifoliate, and it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Clitoria formosa is also valued for its ornamental beauty and potential agricultural use."
