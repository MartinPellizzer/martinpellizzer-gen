    "intro": "Cotyledon fragilis, commonly known as the fragile cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. Its leaves are delicate and prone to breaking, which is why it is sometimes called the \"breakheart\" plant. Cotyledon fragilis is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
