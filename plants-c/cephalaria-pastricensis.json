    "intro": "Cephalaria pastricensis, commonly known as the Canary Islands cephalaria, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the arid and sunny conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, providing some protection against water loss. The flowers, which bloom in the summer, are yellow with a central disk, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
