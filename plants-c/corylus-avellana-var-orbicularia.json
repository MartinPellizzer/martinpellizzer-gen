    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. orbicularia, commonly known as the spherical hazel, is a variant of the common hazel characterized by its unique, rounded, and often bulbous nuts. This plant is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, typically growing in woodland edges and hedgerows. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often have a serrated margin. The spherical nuts are encased in a thick, woody husk, which distinguishes it from other hazel varieties. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
