    "intro": "Cynorkis uliginosa, commonly known as the swamp buttercup, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has smooth, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its moist habitat. It grows from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Cynorkis uliginosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetlands and provides nectar for early pollinators."
