    "intro": "Cotoneaster integrifolius, commonly known as the smoothleaf cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically smooth-edged and have a dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by red or orange berries that persist into winter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. Cotoneaster integrifolius is also valued for its ability to attract wildlife, particularly birds, due to its fruiting habits."
