    "intro": "Coelogyne rumphii, commonly known as the Rumphius orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the lowland forests of Southeast Asia. It features a pseudobulb that supports its growth and stores water, allowing it to survive in seasonal dry periods. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a red or purple lip. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it typically grows in shaded, moist environments. Coelogyne rumphii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
