    "intro": "Convallaria stellifolia, commonly known as starflower, is a species of flowering plant in the family Convallariaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in cool, shaded environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are evergreen, lance-shaped, and form dense, low-growing mats. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its mild cardiac properties."
