    "intro": "Cerastium latifolium var. elongatum, commonly known as the long-leaved mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features small, hairy, ovate leaves that are broader than those of the typical species, with a distinctive elongated shape. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a desirable addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
