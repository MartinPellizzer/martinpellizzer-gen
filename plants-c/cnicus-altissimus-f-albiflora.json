    "intro": "Cnicus altissimus f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered prickly lettuce, is a variant of the prickly lettuce species. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and distinctive yellow flowers. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its white-flowered form is a result of a genetic mutation that alters the typical yellow flower color. This plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
