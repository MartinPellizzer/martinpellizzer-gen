    "intro": "Croton arenosus, commonly known as the sand croton, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, often hairy leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to survive in drought conditions, with a deep root system and thick, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. Croton arenosus is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its resilience in harsh environments."
