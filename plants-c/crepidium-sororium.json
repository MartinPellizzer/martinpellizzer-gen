    "intro": "Crepidium sororium, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, pinkish-purple pouch-shaped flower that resembles a slipper, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. The plant has a short, erect stem with a single leaf and blooms in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in many states."
