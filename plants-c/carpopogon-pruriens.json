It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which can cause skin irritation, giving it its common name. Carpopogon pruriens is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
