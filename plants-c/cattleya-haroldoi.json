    "intro": "Cattleya haroldoi, commonly known as the Harold's Cattleya, is a tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange, with a distinctive purple lip. The plant has broad, leathery leaves and produces pseudobulbs that store water, aiding in its survival in humid environments. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is prized by orchid growers for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
