    "intro": "Calycotropis, commonly known as the Indian hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to Asia, particularly India and Southeast Asia. The plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, red, or white. The leaves are usually alternate, simple, and ovate, with a rough texture. Calycotropis species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
