    "intro": "Croton saxosus, commonly known as the rock croton, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically green with prominent veins and sometimes variegated patterns. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it drought-tolerant. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal environments."
