These plants typically grow in arid and semi-arid regions, showcasing adaptations to harsh environmental conditions. They are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Conostephium species often have hairy leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss.
