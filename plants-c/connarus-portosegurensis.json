    "intro": "Connarus portosegurensis, commonly known as the Potosi mahogany, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the humid lowland forests of northeastern Brazil. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, round, leathery fruits that contain one or two seeds. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and cabinetry, though its habitat is under threat due to deforestation."
