    "intro": "Cordia watsonii, commonly known as the yellow cordia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
