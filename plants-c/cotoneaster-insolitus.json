    "intro": "Cotoneaster insolitus, commonly known as the rare or unusual cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces small, orange-red berries that are a food source for birds. The plant has elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top. Cotoneaster insolitus is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less commonly encountered species within the Cotoneaster genus."
