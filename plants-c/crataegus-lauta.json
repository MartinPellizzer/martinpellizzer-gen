    "intro": "Crataegus lauta, commonly known as the coastal hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It typically grows in sandy or limestone soils along the coastlines, tolerating salt spray and wind. The plant features small, elliptical leaves with serrated edges and produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring. Its fruits are small, red berries that ripen in the fall and are an important food source for birds and wildlife. The plant is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in coastal landscapes."
