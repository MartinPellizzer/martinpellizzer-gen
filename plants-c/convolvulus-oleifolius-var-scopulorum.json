It is a trailing or ascending herb with small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its dry habitat. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This species is often found growing on rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures."
