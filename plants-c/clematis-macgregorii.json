    "intro": "Clematis macgregorii, commonly known as the MacGregor's clematis, is a deciduous vine native to China. It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets, and its flowers are typically white or pale blue with a distinctive, intricate pattern. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental vines. Clematis macgregorii is known for its vigorous growth and ability to climb trellises or walls."
