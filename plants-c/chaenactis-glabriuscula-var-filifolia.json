    "intro": "Chaenactis glabriuscula var. filifolia, commonly known as the filifoliate plains centaury, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight curl, and it produces numerous small, seed-like fruits. This variety is distinguished by its finely divided, thread-like leaves, which give it a delicate appearance."
