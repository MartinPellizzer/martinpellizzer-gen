    "intro": "Caragana opulens var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf bitterbrush, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, angular leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. Its deep root system makes it drought-tolerant and useful for stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
