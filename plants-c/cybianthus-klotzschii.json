    "intro": "Cybianthus klotzschii, commonly known as the mountain lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, with a distinctive hooded structure. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Cybianthus klotzschii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
