    "intro": "Caprifolium parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically small and pointed. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, red berry that matures in the fall and is edible for both humans and wildlife. Caprifolium parvifolium is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth and along stream banks."
