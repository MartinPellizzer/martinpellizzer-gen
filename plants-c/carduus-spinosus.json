    "intro": "Carduus spinosus, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves and stems are covered in sharp prickles, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in treating inflammation and digestive issues."
