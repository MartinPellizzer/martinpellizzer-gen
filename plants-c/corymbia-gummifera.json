    "intro": "Corymbia gummifera, commonly known as the red gum or red blood tree, is a species of eucalyptus native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark that peels in thin flakes, giving it its common name. The tree produces white or cream-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy underside. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of the Australian flora."
