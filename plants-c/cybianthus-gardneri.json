    "intro": "Cybianthus gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's cybianthus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in full sun. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
