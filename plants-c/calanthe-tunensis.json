It is characterized by its upright, slender rhizome and produces a single, erect stem bearing several lance-shaped leaves. The plant flowers in early summer, producing showy, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive lip. Calanthe tunensis thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both horticultural and conservation purposes."
