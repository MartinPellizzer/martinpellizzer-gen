    "intro": "Cyclosorus elatus, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a small, carpet-like moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth and bright yellow-green coloration, which becomes more pronounced as it matures. The plant features short, branching stems covered in small, overlapping leaves that are often curled at the tips. It is typically found in forest floors, rock crevices, and along streams, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention. Cyclosorus elatus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form lush, vibrant moss carpets."
