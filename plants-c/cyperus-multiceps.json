    "intro": "Cyperus multiceps, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Cyperus multiceps produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the base of the plant. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
