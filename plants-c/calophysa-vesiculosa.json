    "intro": "Calophysa vesiculosa, commonly known as the bladderleaf or bladderworts, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap microscopic organisms, aiding in nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. Its leaves are often submerged, while the stems may be floating or rooted in the sediment. Calophysa vesiculosa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
