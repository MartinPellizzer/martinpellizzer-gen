    "intro": "Carapa macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded mahogany, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its straight, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant produces large, woody fruits that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. Carapa macrocarpa plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
