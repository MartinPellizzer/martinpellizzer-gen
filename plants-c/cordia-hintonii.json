    "intro": "Cordia hintonii, commonly known as Hinton's cordia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when mature and turn red upon ripening. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
