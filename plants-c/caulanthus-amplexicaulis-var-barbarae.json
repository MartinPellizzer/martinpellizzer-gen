It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, blue-green leaves that are clasping around the stem. The plant produces racemes of small, showy pink to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland scrub habitats. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
