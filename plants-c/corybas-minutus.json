    "intro": "Corybas minutus, commonly known as the minute helmet orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-like flower that is typically less than 2 centimeters in height. The plant has a short, stout stem with a single, erect flower that is often pale green or yellowish in color. It thrives in damp, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Due to its small size and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
