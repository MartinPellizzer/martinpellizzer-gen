    "intro": "Conchophyllum imbricatum, commonly known as the lace fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, lace-like pattern, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spore-producing structures, known as sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern on the underside of the fronds."
