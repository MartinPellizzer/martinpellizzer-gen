    "intro": "Calamintha gracilis var. pilosior, commonly known as woolly narrowleaf germander, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, aromatic stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and they emit a mint-like fragrance when crushed. It produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and sunny to partially shaded environments, often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
