It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. It is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its defensive spines that deter herbivores. Its ecological importance lies in providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
