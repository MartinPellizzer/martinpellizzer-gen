    "intro": "Callitriche verna f. cespitosa, commonly known as spring water starwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Haloragaceae family. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic herb that typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant has whorled leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its stems are usually prostrate or floating, and it forms dense mats, which can help stabilize sediment in water bodies. The species is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, still or slow-moving waters."
