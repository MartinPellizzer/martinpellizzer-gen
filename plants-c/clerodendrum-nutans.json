    "intro": "Clerodendrum nutans, commonly known as the hanging clerodendrum, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are typically pink or white in color. Its unique feature is the way its branches droop downward, giving it a cascading appearance. Clerodendrum nutans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
