    "intro": "Cyathopsis, commonly known as the \"cup-like fruit\" or \"cupule,\" is a unique botanical structure found in certain flowering plants, particularly in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is a specialized type of fruit that resembles a small cup or cup-like formation, often enclosing the seeds. The cyathopsis typically develops from the fusion of the ovary and the receptacle, creating a protective covering for the developing seeds. This structure is often mistaken for a true fruit, but it is actually a modified inflorescence. The cyathopsis serves both protective and dispersal functions, aiding in the survival and propagation of the plant species."
