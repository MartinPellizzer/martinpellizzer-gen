    "intro": "Cirsium involucratum var. horridum, commonly known as the prickly cardinal. This plant is a perennial herb native to North America, particularly found in prairie and open woodland habitats. It is characterized by its spiny, reddish-brown stems and leaves with coarse, hairy surfaces. The plant produces purple to pinkish-purple flower heads, which are surrounded by a dense layer of bracts. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often considered a wildflower of ecological significance."
