    "intro": "Cladocaulon, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a unique organism that belongs to the lichen family, forming a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is typically found growing on rock surfaces, especially in humid and shaded environments. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body made up of the fungal and algal components. Cladocaulon exhibits a variety of growth forms, including crustose, foliose, and fructicose, depending on the species. Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it an important indicator of environmental health and stability."
