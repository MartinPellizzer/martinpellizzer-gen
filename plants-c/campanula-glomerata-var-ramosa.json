    "intro": "Campanula glomerata var. ramosa, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
