    "intro": "Corallorhiza maculata var. immaculata, commonly known as the white twayblade, is a species of orchid native to the eastern United States. It is a terrestrial herb that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant produces small, white, showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species. Due to its reliance on specific fungal partners and habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many areas."
