    "intro": "Coussapoa cinnamomifolia, commonly known as the cinnamon wood or sweet wood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels and cinnamon trees. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown heartwood that resembles cinnamon in scent and appearance. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a glossy surface, while the flowers are small and clustered in panicles. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited commercial use due to its slow growth and rarity."
