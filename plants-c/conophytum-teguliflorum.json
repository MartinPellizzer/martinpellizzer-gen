    "intro": "Conophytum teguliflorum, commonly known as the \"Horned Cactus\" or \"Teguliflorum,\" is a member of the Aizoaceae family, native to South Africa. It is a succulent plant characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the winter months, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. Its unique leaf structure and flowering habits make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Conophytum teguliflorum thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for drought-tolerant landscaping."
