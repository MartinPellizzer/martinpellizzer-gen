    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe salpingantha, commonly known as the giant lady's tresses, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, spirally twisted stems and dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
