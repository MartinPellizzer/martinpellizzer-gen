It is characterized by its woody stems and distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Cissus sarcospathula is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
