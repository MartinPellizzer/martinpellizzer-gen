    "intro": "Crepidium orbiculare, commonly known as the globular orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, globular growth habit and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct, fragrant scent. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically broad and grass-like, and it often grows in clusters. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in humid, well-drained soil."
