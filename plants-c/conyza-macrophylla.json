It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that appear in the late summer. The plant is an annual herb that grows up to 2 meters tall, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It produces copious amounts of wind-pollinated pollen, which can cause allergic reactions in humans. The species is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
