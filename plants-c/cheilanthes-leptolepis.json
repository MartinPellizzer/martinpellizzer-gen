    "intro": "Cheilanthes leptolepis, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a perennial fern native to North America. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as cliffs and slopes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered near the margins. Cheilanthes leptolepis is a hardy species that is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
