    "intro": "Cydonia pyriformis, commonly known as the Chinese quince, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China and neighboring regions. It produces fragrant, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by large, pear-shaped fruits that mature to a pale yellow or orange color. The fruit has a thick, leathery skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp when fully ripe. It is often used in traditional Chinese medicine and as a culinary ingredient. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
