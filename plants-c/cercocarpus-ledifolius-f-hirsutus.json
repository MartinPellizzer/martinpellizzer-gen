    "intro": "Cercocarpus ledifolius f. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy leaf manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically hairy, which is a distinguishing feature of this form. The plant produces woody, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in chaparral and woodland ecosystems."
