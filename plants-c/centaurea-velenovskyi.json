    "intro": "Centaurea velenovskyi, commonly known as the Velenovsky's cornflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in temperate to alpine climates. Its bright blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
