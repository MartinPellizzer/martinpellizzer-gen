It is characterized by its striking blue-violet petals and serrated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. Its unique floral structure has made it a subject of interest in botanical research. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
