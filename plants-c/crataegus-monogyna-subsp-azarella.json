It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of small white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and flowering habits compared to other hawthorn species."
