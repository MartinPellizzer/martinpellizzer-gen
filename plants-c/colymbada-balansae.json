    "intro": "Colymbada balansae, commonly known as the Balansae water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that form a dense canopy on the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate at the water's edge. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Colymbada balansae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
