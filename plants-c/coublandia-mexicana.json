It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates with adequate sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of hairs. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and potential for horticultural use."
