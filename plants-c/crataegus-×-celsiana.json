    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 celsiana, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Botanically, it is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Crataegus monogyna and Crataegus laevigata."
