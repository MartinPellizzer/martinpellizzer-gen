    "intro": "Claytonia perfoliata var. amplectens, commonly known as the sticky false shamrock, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a sticky, glandular substance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and the stems are often hairy. This variety is well adapted to moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded, damp areas."
