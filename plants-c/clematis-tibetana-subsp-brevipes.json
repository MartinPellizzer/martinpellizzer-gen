    "intro": "Clematis tibetana subsp. brevipes, commonly known as the Tibetan short-stemmed clematis, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and showy, typically blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers are typically clustered in racemes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
