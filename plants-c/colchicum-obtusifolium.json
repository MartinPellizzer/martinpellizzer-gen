    "intro": "Colchicum obtusifolium, commonly known as the blunt-leaved colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically in late summer or early autumn. Its flowers are borne on tall, slender stems and are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in meadows and open woodlands."
