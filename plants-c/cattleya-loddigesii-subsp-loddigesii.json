    "intro": "Cattleya loddigesii subsp. loddigesii, commonly known as the Loddiges' Cattleya, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in tropical and subtropical environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. This orchid is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its vibrant, fragrant blooms."
