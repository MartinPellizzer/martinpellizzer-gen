    "intro": "Cyperus africanus, commonly known as the African flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swamps, riverbanks, and seasonally flooded areas. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can dominate wetland ecosystems. Cyperus africanus is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to various water conditions."
