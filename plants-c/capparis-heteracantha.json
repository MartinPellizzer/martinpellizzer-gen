    "intro": "Capparis heteracantha, commonly known as the rock caper, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and thorny stems, which help it survive in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are often clustered in umbels, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
