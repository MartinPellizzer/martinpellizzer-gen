It typically grows in coastal heathlands and sand dunes, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces striking clusters of pink to red flowers in spring. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
