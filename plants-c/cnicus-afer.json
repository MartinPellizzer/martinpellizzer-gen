    "intro": "Cnicus afer, commonly known as the African sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It features a basal rosette of lobed, hairy leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces yellow flowers that are similar in structure to those of the dandelion, with a radiating pattern of ray florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Cnicus afer is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation."
