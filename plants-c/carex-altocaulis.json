    "intro": "Carex altocaulis, commonly known as the high stalk sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, consist of small, greenish-brown flowers that are wind-pollinated. Carex altocaulis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
