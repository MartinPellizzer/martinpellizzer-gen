It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. The plant features trifoliate leaves with three heart-shaped leaflets and small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in suitable habitats. The species is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-rich soils."
