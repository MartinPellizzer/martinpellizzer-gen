    "intro": "Clidemia allardii subsp. maranonensis, commonly known as the Maranon velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and riverbanks. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, which can make it an invasive species in certain areas. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and more compact growth habit compared to other members of the species."
