    "intro": "Cyathula prostrata f. rubella, commonly known as the red-leaved cyathula, is a variant of the cyathula plant characterized by its distinctive reddish foliage. It is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions, typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are often yellow or green, with the inflorescence forming a cup-like structure known as a cyathium. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptical in shape and may have a slightly hairy texture. This botanical feature makes it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
