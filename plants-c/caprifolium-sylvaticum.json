    "intro": "Caprifolium sylvaticum, commonly known as wild strawberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant's leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. After flowering, it develops red, fleshy fruits that resemble strawberries but are smaller and less sweet. It thrives in woodland edges and moist, well-drained soils."
