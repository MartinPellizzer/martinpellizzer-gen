    "intro": "Cotoneaster roseus, commonly known as the roseleaf cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, glossy, oval leaves that turn red in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the autumn. Cotoneaster roseus is valued for its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. It is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness."
