    "intro": "Castanea castanea var. pubinervis, commonly known as the pubescent-veined chestnut, is a variant of the Chinese chestnut. It is characterized by its hairy veins on the leaves, which distinguish it from other chestnut species. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are ovate with a serrated margin and a pale underside. The fruit is a spiny nut enclosed in a prickly husk, which matures in the autumn."
