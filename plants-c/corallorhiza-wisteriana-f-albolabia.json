    "intro": "Corallorhiza wisteriana f. albolabia, commonly known as the white-labied coralroot, is an epiparasitic orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, labiate (lip-like) structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with hardwood trees. Its flowers are arranged in a loose inflorescence and are pollinated by insects such as bees and wasps. Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized member of the Orchidaceae family."
