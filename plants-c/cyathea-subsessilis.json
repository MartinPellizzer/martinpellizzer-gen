    "intro": "Cyathea subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a structure typical of ferns. Cyathea subsessilis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forest understories. Its ornamental value has made it a popular plant in horticulture, though it requires specific care to maintain its health and growth."
