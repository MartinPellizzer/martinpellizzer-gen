    "intro": "Cynanchum japonicum var. puncticulatum, commonly known as the Japanese milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately divided, with finely toothed margins. The species is noted for its milky sap, which can be toxic, and it is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks."
