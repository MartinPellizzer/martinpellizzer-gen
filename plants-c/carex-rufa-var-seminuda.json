    "intro": "Carex rufa var. seminuda, commonly known as the slender red sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often reddish at the base, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. This species is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife."
