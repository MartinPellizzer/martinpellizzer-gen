    "intro": "Crataegus chrysophyta, commonly known as the golden hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for wildlife. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and the bark is typically smooth with a reddish-brown color. Crataegus chrysophyta is often found in moist woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
