    "intro": "Cotula sonchifolia, commonly known as the common groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous annual with hairy, alternate leaves and yellow flowers that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Cotula sonchifolia is adapted to arid conditions and can survive in poor soil environments."
