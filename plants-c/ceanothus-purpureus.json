    "intro": "Ceanothus purpureus, commonly known as the purple ceanothus, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and clusters of showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, enriching the soil. Ceanothus purpureus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
