    "intro": "Cleome brachyadenia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cleome, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, though it is not closely related to them. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale yellow. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Cleome brachyadenia is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its delicate appearance and ease of cultivation."
