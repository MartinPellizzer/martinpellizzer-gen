    "intro": "Cymopterus spellenbergii, commonly known as the San Francisco fritillary, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound umbels of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces a distinctive, fragrant aroma. Due to habitat loss and urban development, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
