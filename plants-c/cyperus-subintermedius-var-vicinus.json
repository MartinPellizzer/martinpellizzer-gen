    "intro": "Cyperus subintermedius var. vicinus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along water edges, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its small, clustered flowers are usually borne in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. The variety vicinus is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Cyperus subintermedius."
