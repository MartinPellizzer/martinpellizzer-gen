    "intro": "Cotoneaster pritzellii, commonly known as the Pritzell\u2019s cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, spreading branches and small, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its adaptability to various soil types and resistance to pests make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and erosion control."
