It features delicate, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders in horticulture."
