    "intro": "Carex brachyglossa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinct midrib, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters. Carex brachyglossa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
