    "intro": "Cryptolepis laxa, commonly known as the African snake plant, is a perennial herb native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in terminal clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a hardy and low-maintenance plant. Cryptolepis laxa is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
