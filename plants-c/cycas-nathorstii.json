    "intro": "Cycas nathorstii, commonly known as the Nathorst's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that resemble those of a fern. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo, this cycad is adapted to humid, warm climates. Its reproductive structures include large, cone-like strobili, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to its rarity and habitat loss, Cycas nathorstii is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical research."
