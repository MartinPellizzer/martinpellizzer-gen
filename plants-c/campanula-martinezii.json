    "intro": "Campanula martinezii, commonly known as Martinez's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branching. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
