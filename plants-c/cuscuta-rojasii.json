    "intro": "Cuscuta rojasii, commonly known as the Rosas' dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly specialized root system composed of haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States. It is often found growing on shrubs and grasses, forming dense mats that can negatively impact its host. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, Cuscuta rojasii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
