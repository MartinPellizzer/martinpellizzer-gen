    "intro": "Chamaecrista lateriticola, commonly known as the laterite burr legume, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow to orange floral clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained, often poor soils, making it adaptable to rocky and lateritic landscapes. Its seeds are encased in hard, spiny pods, which help in seed dispersal. Chamaecrista lateriticola is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in soil stabilization."
