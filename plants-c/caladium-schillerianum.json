    "intro": "Caladium schillerianum, commonly known as the Schiller's arrowleaf, is a tropical perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically bright red, orange, or yellow, with a contrasting green midrib. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant color and unique leaf patterns. Caladium schillerianum is propagated through tuberous roots and is relatively low maintenance once established."
