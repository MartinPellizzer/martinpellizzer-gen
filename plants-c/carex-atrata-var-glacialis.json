    "intro": "Carex atrata var. glacialis, commonly known as the glacier sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves that form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and subalpine habitats. Due to its cold tolerance and unique morphology, it is an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
