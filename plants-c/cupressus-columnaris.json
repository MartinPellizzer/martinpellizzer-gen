    "intro": "Cupressus columnaris, commonly known as the narrowleaf arborvitae, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender form and dense, scale-like foliage that gives it a columnar appearance. The plant has scale-like leaves that are blue-green in color, arranged in crossed pairs along the branches. It produces small, round cones that contain seeds, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. The tree is relatively disease-resistant but can be susceptible to certain fungal infections under unfavorable conditions."
