    "intro": "Cinnagrostis filifolia, commonly known as the silky bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It features fine, thread-like leaves that are covered in a soft, silky bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
