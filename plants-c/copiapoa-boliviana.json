    "intro": "Copiapoa boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian cactus or the Bolivian torch cactus, is a species of cactus native to the coastal regions of southern Peru and northern Chile. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered in white, fuzzy spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring, which bloom at the top of the stem. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stem and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture from the surface. Copiapoa boliviana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in desert gardens."
