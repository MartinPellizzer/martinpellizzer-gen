    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe bucaramangae, commonly known as the Bucaramanga fern, is a rare and unique species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that display a delicate, fern-like structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are typically located on the underside of its leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
