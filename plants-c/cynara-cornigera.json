    "intro": "Cynara cornigera, commonly known as the Spanish artichoke, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, lobed leaves. The plant produces a unique, edible flower head that resembles an artichoke, although it is not related to the common artichoke. Its botanical features include a thick, fibrous stem and a dense cluster of bracts that enclose the flowering structures. Cynara cornigera is often cultivated for its edible parts and is valued for its ornamental qualities as well."
