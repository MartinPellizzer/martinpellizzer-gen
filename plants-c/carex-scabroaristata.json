    "intro": "Carex scabroaristata, commonly known as the rough-haired sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a rough, scaly texture, giving it its common name. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, consist of small, clustered flowers surrounded by bracts. Carex scabroaristata is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
