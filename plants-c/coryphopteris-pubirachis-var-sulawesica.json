    "intro": "Coryphopteris pubirachis var. sulawesica, commonly known as the Sulawesi huperzia, is a rare fern native to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. It is characterized by its tall, slender rhizome and distinctive, lanceolate leaves with a pubescent underside. The leaves are typically arranged in a spiral pattern and exhibit a dark green color with a glossy texture. This variety is notable for its unique morphological features and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
