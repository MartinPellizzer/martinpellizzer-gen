    "intro": "Clematis ligusticifolia var. californica, commonly known as the California Clematis, is a deciduous vine native to coastal regions of California. It features slender, twining stems that can grow up to 15 feet in length, supporting clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale blue flowers. The foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with finely toothed margins, and the plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its climbing habit and seasonal blooms. This variety is more compact than the typical Clematis ligusticifolia, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces."
