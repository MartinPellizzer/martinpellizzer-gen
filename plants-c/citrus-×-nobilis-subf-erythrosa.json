    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 nobilis subf. erythrosa, commonly known as the red citrus or red grapefruit, is a botanical variant of the grapefruit species. It is characterized by its distinctive red pigmentation in the peel and flesh, which is due to the accumulation of anthocyanins. This subvariety is typically smaller than standard grapefruit and has a slightly tart flavor profile. It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and requires full sun for optimal growth. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and unique fruit characteristics in horticultural settings."
