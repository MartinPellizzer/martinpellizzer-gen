    "intro": "Cardamine bellidifolia var. beringensis, commonly known as Bering's watercress, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, often alpine or tundra environments, where it forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to that of watercress, making it a valuable forage plant for both humans and wildlife. The species is also notable for its ability to tolerate extreme cold and is often used in ecological restoration projects in harsh environments."
