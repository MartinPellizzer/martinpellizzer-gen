    "intro": "Cactus robustior, commonly known as the robust cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces spiny, paddle-shaped leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Cactus robustior is well adapted to desert conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in its native habitat."
