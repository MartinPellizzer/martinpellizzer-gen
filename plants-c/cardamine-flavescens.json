    "intro": "Cardamine flavescens, commonly known as yellow buttercup, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are usually trifoliate, with each leaflet being lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs."
