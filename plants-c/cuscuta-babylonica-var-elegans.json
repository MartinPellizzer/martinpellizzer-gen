    "intro": "Cuscuta babylonica var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is native to regions in Asia and is often found parasitizing various species of grasses and shrubs. Its life cycle involves producing seeds that can remain dormant in the soil for extended periods. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and ornamental plants."
