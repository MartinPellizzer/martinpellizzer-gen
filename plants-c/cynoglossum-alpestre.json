It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces blue to purple bell-shaped flowers during the summer months. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often found in alpine meadows and on rocky slopes at high elevations. Cynoglossum alpestre is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
