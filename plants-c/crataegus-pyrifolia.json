    "intro": "Crataegus pyrifolia, commonly known as the Japanese hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, and its showy, white to pink flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus pyrifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal interest. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
