    "intro": "Calla oculata, commonly known as the water arum, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It features a distinctive, showy spadix surrounded by a large, white or greenish spathe, which resembles a flower. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and pond edges. Its leaves are arrow-shaped and typically have a waxy surface to repel water. Calla oculata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
