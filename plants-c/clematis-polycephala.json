    "intro": "Clematis polycephala, commonly known as the many-headed clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive blue to purple berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its foliage is typically compound, with three to five leaflets that are ovate to lance-shaped. Clematis polycephala thrives in partial to full sun and prefers well-drained, moist soil."
