    "intro": "Cylicomorpha solmsii, commonly known as the Solms's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Native to South Africa, it thrives in specific microhabitats with well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
