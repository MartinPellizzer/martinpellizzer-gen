    "intro": "Cactus viridis, commonly known as the green cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and ability to store water, which helps it survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months. Cactus viridis is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements."
