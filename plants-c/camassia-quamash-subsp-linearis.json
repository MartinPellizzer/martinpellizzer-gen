    "intro": "Camassia quamash subsp. linearis, commonly known as the narrowleaf camas, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features grass-like basal leaves and produces showy blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are edible when properly prepared and have been traditionally used by Indigenous peoples. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, linear leaves compared to the broader leaves of other camas species."
