    "intro": "Caladenia elongata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spider-orchid, is an Australian orchid species characterized by its slender, spider-like appearance. It typically grows in sandy or loamy soils in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained conditions. The plant features a single, narrow leaf and a spike of elongated, pink or red flowers with distinctive spurred petals. Caladenia elongata is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Its flowering period usually occurs during the cooler months, adding to its ecological significance in native ecosystems."
