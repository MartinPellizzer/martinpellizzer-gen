    "intro": "Carex laxiflora var. blanda, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. Its flowering stems bear small, clustered spikes of greenish-white flowers, which are followed by triangular, spikelet-like fruits. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
