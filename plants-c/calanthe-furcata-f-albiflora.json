It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. Its flowers are notable for their intricate structure and subtle fragrance, making it a sought-after specimen in horticulture. The variety albiflora is distinguished by its predominantly white floral display, which sets it apart from other forms of Calanthe furcata."
