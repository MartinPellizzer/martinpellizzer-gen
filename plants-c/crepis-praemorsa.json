    "intro": "Crepis praemorsa, commonly known as the early bentgrass, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is native to Europe and parts of western Asia. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Crepis praemorsa is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides, meadows, and wetlands. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
