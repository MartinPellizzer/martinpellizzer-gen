    "intro": "Camaridium iguapense, commonly known as the Iguapense orchid, is a tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Camaridium iguapense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in controlled environments."
