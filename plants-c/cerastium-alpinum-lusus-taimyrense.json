    "intro": "Cerastium alpinum lusus taimyrense, commonly known as the Taimyrense mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of northern Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are typically hairy and opposite. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous and subarctic environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range."
