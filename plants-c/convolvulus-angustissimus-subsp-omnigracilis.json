    "intro": "Convolvulus angustissimus subsp. omnigracilis, commonly known as the slender morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped leaves and small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its stems are wiry and tend to twine around supporting structures, a common trait in the Convolvulaceae family. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
