    "intro": "Cypripedium barbatum var. warnerianum, commonly known as the Warner's lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats, often on rocky or wooded slopes. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
