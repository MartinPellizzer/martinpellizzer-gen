It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the spring, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits.
