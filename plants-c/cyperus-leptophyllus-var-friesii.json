    "intro": "Cyperus leptophyllus var. friesii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedgeland sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical flower spikes. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and shallow water areas, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to diverse water conditions."
