    "intro": "Ceropegia diffusa, commonly known as the boneless or string of hearts plant, is a climbing succulent native to southern Africa. It features thin, fleshy stems that can trail or climb, often forming a cascading appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which are pollinated by specific moths. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy texture. Ceropegia diffusa is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
