    "intro": "Capnites bayernianus, commonly known as the Bavarian capnites, is a rare and unusual plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Primulaceae, characterized by its small, clustered flowers and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant typically grows in rocky, acidic soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its floral structure is simple, with five petals that are often white or pale pink in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Capnites bayernianus is considered a species of conservation concern."
