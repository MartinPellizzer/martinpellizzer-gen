    "intro": "Cuscuta europaea subsp. nefrens, commonly known as the European dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that twine around its host. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found parasitizing crops such as beans and peas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread to new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural plants."
