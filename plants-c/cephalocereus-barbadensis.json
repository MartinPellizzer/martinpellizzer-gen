    "intro": "Cephalocereus barbadensis, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a columnar cactus with a tall, unbranched stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale pink. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system adapted to arid environments. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bats and moths, making it an important plant in tropical ecosystems."
