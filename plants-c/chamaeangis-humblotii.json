    "intro": "Chamaeangis humblotii, commonly known as the Blunt-leafed Bignay, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed, typical of many species in its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
