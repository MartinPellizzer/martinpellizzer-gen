    "intro": "Carex pulla, commonly known as black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of brownish flowers. Native to wetland and marshy habitats, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
