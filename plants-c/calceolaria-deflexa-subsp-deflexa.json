It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, lip-shaped petals that resemble small cups. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist conditions, often in rocky or alpine environments. Its flowers are usually pale pink to white, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Calceolaria deflexa subsp. deflexa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climate conditions."
