    "intro": "Chiloschista parishii var. minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered chiloschista, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbrella-shaped clusters, typical of the carrot family. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is a relatively rare and specialized species in its native range."
