    "intro": "Cymbopogon schoenanthus, commonly known as the narrowleaf grass or sweet grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Cymbopogon schoenanthus is often used in traditional medicine and for its essential oils, which are valued for their aromatic and therapeutic properties."
