    "intro": "Colchicum neapolitanum var. aetnense, commonly known as the Aetna colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the volcanic regions of Sicily. It features striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
