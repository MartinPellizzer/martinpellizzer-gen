    "intro": "Carex basilaris, commonly known as the basal sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-white flowers in the summer. Its root system is fibrous, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats. Carex basilaris is an important plant for supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
