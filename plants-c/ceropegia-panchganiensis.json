It is a succulent vine characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the humid climate of its native region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
