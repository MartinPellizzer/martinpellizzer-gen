    "intro": "Corrigiola litoralis subsp. litoralis, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and sandy soils. The plant produces tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and rocky shores along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. This subspecies is notable for its resilience to harsh maritime conditions and its role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
