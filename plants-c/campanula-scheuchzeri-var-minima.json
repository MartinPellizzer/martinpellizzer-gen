    "intro": "Campanula scheuchzeri var. minima, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its alpine habitat, it is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous environments."
