    "intro": "Chrysosplenium lanuginosum var. ciliatum, commonly known as the silky spleenwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Saxifragaceae family. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually oval to lance-shaped with a hairy texture, and the flowers are usually white or pale pink. This variant is distinguished by its finely ciliated leaf margins, which contribute to its botanical uniqueness."
