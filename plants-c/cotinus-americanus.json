    "intro": "Cotinus americanus, commonly known as the American smoketree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and purple in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, pinkish-brown seed heads that persist into winter. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. Cotinus americanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
