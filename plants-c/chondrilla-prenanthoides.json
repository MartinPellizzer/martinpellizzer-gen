    "intro": "Chondrilla prenanthoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf chondrilla, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of many small florets. The plant typically grows from a short, thick rhizome and has linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers appear in clusters and bloom during the summer months. Chondrilla prenanthoides is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers."
