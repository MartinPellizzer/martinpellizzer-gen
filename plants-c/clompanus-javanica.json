    "intro": "Clompanus javanica, commonly known as the Javanese orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in the soil while absorbing nutrients. Clompanus javanica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
