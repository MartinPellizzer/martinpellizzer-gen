    "intro": "Crucianella, commonly known as the sea bean or sea bean tree, is a small evergreen shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, bean-like fruits that are adapted for dispersal by water, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky coastal environments. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and poor soil conditions makes it a hardy species often found in maritime climates."
