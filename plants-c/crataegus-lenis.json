    "intro": "Crataegus lenis, commonly known as the smooth crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and features alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by edible, red or yellow berries that mature in the fall. Its fruit is an important food source for birds and mammals, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The smooth crabapple is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
