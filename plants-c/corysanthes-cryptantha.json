    "intro": "Corysanthes cryptantha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like structures that resemble foliage, which help it blend into its surroundings. The plant produces striking white flowers with a distinctive, intricate pattern that mimics the appearance of a ghostly figure. It requires a humid, shaded environment and is often found growing on the trunks of old trees. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is a subject of conservation interest and botanical study."
