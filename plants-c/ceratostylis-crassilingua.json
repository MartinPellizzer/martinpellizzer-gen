It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a slender, upright stem with closely spaced, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that are clustered in small, club-like formations along the leaf margins. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
