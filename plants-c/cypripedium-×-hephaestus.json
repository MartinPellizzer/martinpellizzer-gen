    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 hephaestus, commonly known as the golden tuckahoe, is a hybrid orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers with a distinctive dark red or purple lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single, showy flower per stem. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
