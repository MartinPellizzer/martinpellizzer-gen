It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, coastal environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
