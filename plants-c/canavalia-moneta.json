    "intro": "Canavalia moneta, commonly known as the money plant or dollar plant, is a leguminous species native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces flat, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as a food source. Canavalia moneta is a climbing plant that can grow up to several meters in height, often using other plants or structures for support. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
