    "intro": "Cuscuta runyonii, commonly known as the Runyon dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of slender, thread-like stems. The plant attaches to its host using specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is native to the southeastern United States and is often found growing on plants such as morning glory and other broadleaf species. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
