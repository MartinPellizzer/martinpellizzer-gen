It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its dense, spiky inflorescence that resembles a pincushion. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting native pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette. Carmichaelia stricta is typically found in coastal and lowland areas, growing in well-drained soils."
