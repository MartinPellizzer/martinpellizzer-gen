    "intro": "Crataegus glareosa, commonly known as the shining hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, often thornless bark and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to native plant gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year."
