    "intro": "Cynanchum amplexicaule, commonly known as the broadleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves that clasp the stem, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Cynanchum amplexicaule is noted for its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin."
