It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and distinctive spotted or mottled stems. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
