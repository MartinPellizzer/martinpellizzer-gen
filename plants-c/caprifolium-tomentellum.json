    "intro": "Caprifolium tomentellum, commonly known as the woolly honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial shade to full sun. Caprifolium tomentellum is often found in forest edges and rocky slopes, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
