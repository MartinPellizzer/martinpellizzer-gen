    "intro": "Convolvulus arvensis f. perroseus, commonly known as the pale-flowered field bindweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale pink to white in color, often with a slight bluish tinge. Its leaves are heart-shaped and opposite, with a rough, hairy texture. This variant is distinguished by its reduced corolla lobes, giving it a more delicate appearance compared to the typical form of Convolvulus arvensis."
