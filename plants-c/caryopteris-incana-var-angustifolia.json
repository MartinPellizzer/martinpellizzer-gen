    "intro": "Caryopteris incana var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf blue mistflower, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in soft, gray-green foliage that turns reddish in autumn. The plant produces clusters of sky-blue, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens and pollinator habitats."
