    "intro": "Cyphomandra itabirensis, commonly known as the Itabira passionfruit, is a tropical vine native to Brazil. It belongs to the Passifloraceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and showy, colorful flowers. The plant produces edible, orange-colored berries that are similar in appearance to passionfruit but have a distinct flavor. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are woody and have a slightly prickly texture. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
