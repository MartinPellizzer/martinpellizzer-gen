    "intro": "Cogswellia parryi, commonly known as the Parry's cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the Sonoran Desert in North America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. It is adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system and spines for protection. Cogswellia parryi is often found growing in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
