    "intro": "Corybas erythrocarpus, commonly known as the red-fruited hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like floral structure that encloses the reproductive organs, a feature typical of the Corybas genus. The plant produces bright red or orange berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and along stream banks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
