    "intro": "Crataegus lindmanii var. jodalii, commonly known as the Jodalii hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Scandinavia. It is characterized by its dense, thorned branches and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
