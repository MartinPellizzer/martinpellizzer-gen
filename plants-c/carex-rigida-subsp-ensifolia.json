    "intro": "Carex rigida subsp. ensifolia, commonly known as the sword sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and sword-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
