    "intro": "Cirsium dinaricum, commonly known as the Dinaric thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, such as slopes and grasslands. It has a robust root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
