    "intro": "Centaurea iljinii, commonly known as Iljin's cornflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the Caucasus region. It is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae, characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Centaurea iljinii is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
