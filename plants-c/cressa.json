    "intro": "Cressa, commonly known as water cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its roots are often submerged in water, which contributes to its aquatic or semi-aquatic nature. Cressa is known for its peppery flavor and has been used in culinary and medicinal applications for centuries."
