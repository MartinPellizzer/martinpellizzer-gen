    "intro": "Cyphokentia tete, commonly known as the Tete palm, is a rare and unique species native to the island of Tete in Madagascar. It is a member of the Arecaceae family, characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. Its botanical features make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human activities."
