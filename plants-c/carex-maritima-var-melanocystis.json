    "intro": "Carex maritima var. melanocystis, commonly known as black-cysted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to brown in color. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in dune environments or along the edges of tidal marshes. Its leaves are usually narrow and dark green, with a slightly rough texture. This variety is notable for its ability to stabilize soil and contribute to the ecological health of coastal habitats."
