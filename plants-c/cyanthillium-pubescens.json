    "intro": "Cyanthillium pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bluebell, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a mild, aromatic scent, while its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine. Cyanthillium pubescens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas."
