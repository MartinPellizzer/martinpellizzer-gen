    "intro": "Callista revoluta, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces showy, fragrant blooms that open in the morning and close by midday. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a common weed in agricultural areas. Botanically, it belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is known for its distinctive seed pods that split open to release its seeds."
