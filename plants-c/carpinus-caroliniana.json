It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by small, oval fruits that turn dark blue when mature. It typically grows to a height of 30 to 50 feet and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
