    "intro": "Combretum harrisii, commonly known as the red sand boa or red sand tree, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, elliptical leaves that are typically red or purple in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Combretum harrisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
