    "intro": "Citronella sucumbiensis, commonly known as the West Indian citronella, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves that emit a strong citronella scent. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fluffy, seed-filled spikelets. It is often cultivated for its mosquito-repelling properties due to the presence of citral in its essential oils. However, it is not as widely used commercially as other citronella species due to its limited yield and regional distribution."
