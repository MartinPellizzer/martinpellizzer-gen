    "intro": "Calamintha \u00d7 thymifolia, commonly known as hybrid thyme-mint, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Calamintha officinalis and Calamintha nepeta. It is a low-growing perennial herb with aromatic, fuzzy leaves that emit a strong mint-like scent. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or violet, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Native to the mountainous regions of Europe, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its ornamental value and aromatic properties, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in herbal remedies."
