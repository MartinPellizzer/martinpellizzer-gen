    "intro": "Centaurea albovii, commonly known as the white centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Centaurea albovii is often found in coastal and mountainous areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
