It is characterized by its striking, waxy, crocodile-like leaves that are often used in ornamental horticulture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden within a spathe, a feature common in many aroid species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity to flourish. Due to its unusual appearance and specific care requirements, it is a sought-after plant among collectors and enthusiasts."
