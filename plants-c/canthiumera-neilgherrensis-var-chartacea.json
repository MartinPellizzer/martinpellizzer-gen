    "intro": "Canthiumera neilgherrensis var. chartacea, commonly known as the Himalayan chartaceous canthiumera, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive papery, chartaceous leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in montane forests and alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
