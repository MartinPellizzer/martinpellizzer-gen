    "intro": "Cinnamomum massoia, commonly known as the sacred sandalwood of Indonesia, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Indonesia. It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood and leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by dark purple berries containing seeds. Its essential oil, extracted from the wood, is highly valued for its use in perfumery and spiritual practices. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
