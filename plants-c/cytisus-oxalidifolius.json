It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, resembling those of the oxalis plant, hence its specific epithet. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
