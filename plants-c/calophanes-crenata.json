    "intro": "Calophanes crenata, commonly known as the crested calophanes, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, waxy leaves with a serrated edge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Calophanes crenata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some tropical gardens."
