    "intro": "Carex festiva var. haydeniana, commonly known as Hayden's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is native to North America and is often found in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. The plant is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
