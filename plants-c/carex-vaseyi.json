    "intro": "Carex vaseyi, commonly known as the Vasey's sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to North America, particularly found in the western United States and parts of Canada. This perennial plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It has grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
