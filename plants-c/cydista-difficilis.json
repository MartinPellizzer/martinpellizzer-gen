    "intro": "Cydista difficilis, commonly known as the difficult cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, a feature typical of cycads. Cydista difficilis is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
