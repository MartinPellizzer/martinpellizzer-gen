    "intro": "Campanula patula var. jahorinae, commonly known as the Jahorina bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and form dense clusters over time."
