    "intro": "Coelogyne maculata, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and orange, often with distinctive markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Coelogyne maculata is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
