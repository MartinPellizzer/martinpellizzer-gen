    "intro": "Consolida linarioides, commonly known as the common honeyflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and other flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that resemble small bells. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. The seeds are encased in a distinctive, three-lobed capsule that splits open when mature to release the seeds."
