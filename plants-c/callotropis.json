    "intro": "Callotropis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are native to coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. They are characterized by their striking blue or purple flowers and spiny, lobed leaves. Callotropis species are typically shrubs or small trees that thrive in sandy or rocky soils near the coast. Their unique adaptations allow them to survive in harsh, saline environments."
