    "intro": "Cynorkis flexuosatis, commonly known as the flexible orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically arranged in a loose inflorescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
