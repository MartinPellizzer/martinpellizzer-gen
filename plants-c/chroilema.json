It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their opposite, simple, and often spiny leaves. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish or yellowish in color.
