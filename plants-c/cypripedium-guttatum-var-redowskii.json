    "intro": "Cypripedium guttatum var. redowskii, commonly known as the Redowski's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch and intricate patterns of red and yellow. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this species is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
