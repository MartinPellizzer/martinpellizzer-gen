    "intro": "Cytisus decumbens var. pedunculatus, commonly known as the creeping yellow broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes along the stems. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and trifoliate, with each leaflet being narrow and pointed. It is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
