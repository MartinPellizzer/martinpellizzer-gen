    "intro": "Cryptochilus farreri, commonly known as the Farrer's cryptochilus, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually elliptical and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and reducing water loss. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
