    "intro": "Carex hindsii var. brevigluma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces three-sided, three-rowed seed capsules. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, broader leaves compared to other Carex species."
