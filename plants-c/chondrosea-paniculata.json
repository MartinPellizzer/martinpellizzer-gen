    "intro": "Chondrosea paniculata, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in its saline environment. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. Chondrosea paniculata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky shores or in sandy coastal areas. Its unique adaptations make it a hardy and visually appealing plant for coastal gardens."
