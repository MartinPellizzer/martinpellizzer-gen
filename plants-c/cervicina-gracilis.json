    "intro": "Cervicina gracilis, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate forest regions. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions. Cervicina gracilis plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to its nectar-rich flowers."
