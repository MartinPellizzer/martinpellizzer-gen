    "intro": "Carduus scariosus, commonly known as the rough sowthistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various environments, though it is considered a weed in some regions."
