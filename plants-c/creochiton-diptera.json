    "intro": "Creochiton diptera, commonly known as the dipterous snail, is a species of air-breathing land snail. It belongs to the family Helicarionidae and is characterized by its spiral shell and moist, slimy body. The plant-like appearance of its shell and the presence of a mantle that secretes the shell are key botanical features. It thrives in humid environments, often found in forests and gardens. The snail's feeding habits involve consuming decaying plant matter, contributing to nutrient cycling in its ecosystem."
