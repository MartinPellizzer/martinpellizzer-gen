    "intro": "Craspedaria rupestris, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss. Craspedaria rupestris is often found growing on rocky outcrops and is adapted to full sun exposure."
