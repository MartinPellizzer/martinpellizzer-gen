    "intro": "Chamaecyparis lawsoniana var. billwoodiana, commonly known as the Billwood cedar, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Port Orford cedar. It is characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and scale-like foliage that is dark green on top and silvery-white underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It is native to the coastal regions of Oregon and is adapted to moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is considered a valuable and protected species in its native habitat."
