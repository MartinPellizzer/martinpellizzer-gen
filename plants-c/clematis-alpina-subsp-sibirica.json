    "intro": "Clematis alpina subsp. sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian Clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, twining stems that can grow up to 6 meters in length, supported by opposite, simple, and ovate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant, white or pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in clusters. Its flowers are followed by small, dry, winged fruits that disperse seeds by wind. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
