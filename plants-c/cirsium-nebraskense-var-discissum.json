It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and large, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces and a distinctive basal rosette. This species is adapted to dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairie habitats. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is considered a native wildflower in its range."
