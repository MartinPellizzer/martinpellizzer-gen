It is characterized by its upright growth habit and silver-blue foliage that turns coppery in the fall. The plant produces feathery panicles of small, pale blue to purple flowers in late summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. Calamagrostis carinata is often used in ornamental landscaping for its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
