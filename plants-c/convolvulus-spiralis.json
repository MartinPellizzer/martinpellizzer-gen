    "intro": "Convolvulus spiralis, commonly known as the spiral bindweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its helical, spiral-shaped stems that twist around supports as it grows. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Convolvulus spiralis is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry, sunny habitats."
