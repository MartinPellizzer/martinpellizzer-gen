    "intro": "Clematis confusa, commonly known as the Japanese clematis, is a deciduous vine native to East Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant thrives in partial to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and can climb trellises or fences with ease. Clematis confusa is relatively low maintenance but benefits from regular pruning to maintain its shape and encourage blooming."
