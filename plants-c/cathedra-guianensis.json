    "intro": "Cathedra guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan cathedral, is a strikingly tall and slender plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is a type of cycad, characterized by its unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, and its reproductive structures are typically separate, with male and female cones on different plants. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its slow growth and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
