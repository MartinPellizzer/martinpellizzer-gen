    "intro": "Calciphila, commonly known as the limestone-loving plant, is a genus of flowering plants that thrives in calcareous soils. These plants are typically found in regions with high limestone content, such as rocky or alkaline environments. They exhibit specialized adaptations to tolerate and even benefit from the high pH and mineral content of their habitat. Calciphila species often have thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Their flowers are usually small and clustered, often displaying shades of white or pale yellow."
