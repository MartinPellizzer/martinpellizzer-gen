    "intro": "Calcitrapa calcitrapa, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with slender, hairy stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Calcitrapa calcitrapa is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
