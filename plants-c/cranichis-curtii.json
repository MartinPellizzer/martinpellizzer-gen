    "intro": "Cranichis curtii, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is a terrestrial orchid with slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its small size and specialized habitat make it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
