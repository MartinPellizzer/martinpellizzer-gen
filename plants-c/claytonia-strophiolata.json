    "intro": "Claytonia strophiolata, commonly known as the Sierra glacierwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a dense inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with cold temperatures. Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine gardens."
