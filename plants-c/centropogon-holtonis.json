    "intro": "Centropogon holtonis, commonly known as the Holton's spikegrass, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It typically grows in wetland or marshy areas, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Centropogon holtonis is considered a rare and endangered species."
