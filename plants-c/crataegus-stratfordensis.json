    "intro": "Crataegus stratfordensis, commonly known as Stratford hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the United Kingdom. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate to elliptical leaves, and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the autumn, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Stratford hawthorn is typically found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky soils, and it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
