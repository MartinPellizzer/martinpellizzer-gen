    "intro": "Castilleja helleri, commonly known as Heller's paintbrush, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking red to orange tubular flowers. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. Native to the western United States, it typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. The plant has slender, branched stems and lacks true leaves, relying on its flowers for reproductive success. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
