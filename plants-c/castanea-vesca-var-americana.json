    "intro": "Castanea vesca var. americana, commonly known as the American chestnut. This variety is a subspecies of the European chestnut, characterized by its robust growth and adaptability to various soil types. It is known for its large, edible nuts that are encased in a spiny husk. The plant is typically a deciduous tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters in its native range. However, it has been heavily impacted by chestnut blight, leading to its near extinction in the wild."
