    "intro": "Cyperus haspan var. dietrichiae, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae, although it is often classified under the sedge family Cyperaceae. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of wetland vegetation."
