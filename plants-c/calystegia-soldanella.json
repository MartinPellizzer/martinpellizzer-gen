    "intro": "Calystegia soldanella, commonly known as the small-flowered morning glory, is a climbing vine belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, funnel-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale blue. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and along woodland edges. Its stems are hairy and tend to twine around supporting structures as it grows. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, dry seeds when mature."
