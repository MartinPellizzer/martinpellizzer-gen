It produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in agricultural settings for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its botanical features make it both ecologically and agriculturally significant."
