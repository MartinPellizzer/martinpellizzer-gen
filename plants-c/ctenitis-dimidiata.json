    "intro": "Ctenitis dimidiata, commonly known as the split-fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into two parts, giving it its common name. The plant has a tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer known as the rachis. Its fronds are typically pinnately compound, with a lush, green appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. Ctenitis dimidiata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
