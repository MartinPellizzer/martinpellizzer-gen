    "intro": "Cerastium alpinum var. fischerianum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, hairy, kidney-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions. It has a mat-forming growth habit, which helps it anchor in loose soil and withstand strong winds. This variety is often used in rock gardens and alpine displays due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
