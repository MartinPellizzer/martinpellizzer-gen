    "intro": "Callitriche palustris subsp. verna, commonly known as early marshwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant found in wetlands and slow-moving waters. It typically grows in dense mats, with slender, branching stems that are often submerged or partially emergent. The plant produces tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This subspecies is adapted to nutrient-rich, freshwater environments and plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems."
