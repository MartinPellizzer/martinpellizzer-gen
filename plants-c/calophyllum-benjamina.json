    "intro": "Calophyllum benjamina, commonly known as the Benin mahogany, is a tropical tree native to West Africa. It belongs to the family Calophyllaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and elliptical leaves. The plant produces yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing aromatic seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
