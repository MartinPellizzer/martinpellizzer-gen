The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. Its bark is thick and rough, often exuding a camphor-like scent, which gives the plant its common name. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
