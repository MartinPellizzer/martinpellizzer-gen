    "intro": "Ctenopteris sericeolanata, commonly known as the silky water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are covered in a silky, silver-white coating. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and form dense colonies, contributing to its ornamental value in aquatic and terrestrial gardens. The fronds are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions, making it a unique and visually striking plant."
