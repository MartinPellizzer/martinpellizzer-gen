    "intro": "Canscora tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled corymbiferous plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often four-angled, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically small, oval, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Canscora tetragona is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
