    "intro": "Cestichis kempteriana, commonly known as the Kempter's cestichis, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to violet, often with contrasting white or yellow markings. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range."
