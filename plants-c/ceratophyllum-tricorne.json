    "intro": "Ceratophyllum tricorne, commonly known as the triangular hornwort, is a freshwater plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth and bright green, branching stems. The plant lacks true leaves but has small, scale-like structures that aid in photosynthesis. It thrives in still or slow-moving water and is often found in ponds and lakes. Ceratophyllum tricorne is a popular choice for aquariums due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
