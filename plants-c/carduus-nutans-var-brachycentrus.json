    "intro": "Carduus nutans var. brachycentrus, commonly known as the short-stalked thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm, with a hairy stem and basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in stiff bristles. Its flowers are yellow and appear in dense clusters, often surrounded by a series of spiny bracts. This variant is distinguished by its shorter peduncles compared to the typical Carduus nutans, making it a notable subspecies in botanical studies."
