    "intro": "Calopogon tuberosus f. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered bog orchid, is a rare variant of the bog orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking white flowers, which contrast with the usual greenish-yellow blooms of the typical species. The plant thrives in wetland habitats, particularly in bogs and marshes, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. Its tuberous roots help it survive in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils. The white-flowered form is a naturally occurring mutation, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
