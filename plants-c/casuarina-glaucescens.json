    "intro": "Casuarina glaucescens, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like foliage that forms dense, feathery clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in dune environments due to its tolerance of salt and wind. Casuarina glaucescens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
