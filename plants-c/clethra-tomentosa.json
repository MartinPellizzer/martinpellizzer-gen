    "intro": "Clethra tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly clethra, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescent foliage, which gives it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Clethra tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for pollinators and shelter for wildlife."
