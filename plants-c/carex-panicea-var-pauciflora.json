    "intro": "Carex panicea var. pauciflora, commonly known as the slender swamp sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, with narrow, grass-green leaves that are typically\u4e1b\u751f (clumped) at the base. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense, panicle-like clusters, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is notable for its reduced flowering compared to other Carex species, hence its name \"pauciflora,\" meaning \"few-flowered.\""
