It is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange rind and elongated, horn-like shape. The plant produces small, pale green fruits that are typically harvested when still immature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated as an ornamental or specialty crop."
