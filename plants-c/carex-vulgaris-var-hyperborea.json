    "intro": "Carex vulgaris var. hyperborea, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in cold climates. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense clumps, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters. It is often found in tundra and mountain meadows where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms. Its hardy nature makes it an important component of high-altitude and polar ecosystems."
