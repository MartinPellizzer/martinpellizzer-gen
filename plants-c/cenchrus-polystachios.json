    "intro": "Cenchrus polystachios, commonly known as the rigid beardgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features dense, tufted clusters of spikelets that give it a distinctive appearance, with each spikelet containing several bract-like structures. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its coarse texture. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Cenchrus polystachios is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
