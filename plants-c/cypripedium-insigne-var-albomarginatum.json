    "intro": "Cypripedium insigne var. albomarginatum, commonly known as the white-margin lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive white margin around the lip, which sets it apart from other members of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats and has a long, fleshy rhizome that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it is considered a conservation concern due to habitat loss and over-collection. This orchid is highly valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological significance in its native ecosystems."
