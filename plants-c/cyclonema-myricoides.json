    "intro": "Cyclonema myricoides, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It possesses small, leathery leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, orange berries. Cyclonema myricoides is native to parts of Africa and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
