    "intro": "Carex panicea f. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf panicled sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers, which are typical of the sedge family. It is often found in moist to wet soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
