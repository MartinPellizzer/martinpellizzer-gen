    "intro": "Cambessedesia hilariana var. setosa, commonly known as the hairy or bristly spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and fleshy, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
