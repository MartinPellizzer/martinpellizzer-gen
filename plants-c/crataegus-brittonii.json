    "intro": "Crataegus brittonii, commonly known as the Britton hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in the fall. Crataegus brittonii is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and moist soils, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
