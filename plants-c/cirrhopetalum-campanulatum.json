    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum campanulatum, commonly known as the bell-shaped cirrhopetalum, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, often found on trees or rocks in humid environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a waxy texture, while the flowers are clustered in inflorescences. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some horticultural collections, though it is not widely commercially available."
