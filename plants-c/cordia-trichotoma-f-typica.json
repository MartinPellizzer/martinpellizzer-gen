    "intro": "Cordia trichotoma f. typica, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in dry savannas and woodland areas. The species is valued for its hard, durable wood, though it is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of tannins."
