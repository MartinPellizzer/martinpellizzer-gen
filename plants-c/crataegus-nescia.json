    "intro": "Crataegus nescia, commonly known as the obscure hawthorn, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its small, thorny branches and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it is often found in woodland edges and rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
