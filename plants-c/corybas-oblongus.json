    "intro": "Corybas oblongus, commonly known as the broad-leafed hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like flower that resembles a small, closed umbrella. The plant typically grows from a rhizome and produces a single, showy flower with a dark, velvety sepal and a prominent, spurred labellum. Its flowers are often pollinated by flies, which are attracted to the scent and color of the flower. Corybas oblongus is an epiphytic or lithophytic species, often found growing on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments."
