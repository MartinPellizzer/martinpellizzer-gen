    "intro": "Corybas ponapensis, commonly known as the Ponape torch-orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the island of Ponap\u00e9 in the Federated States of Micronesia. It is characterized by its striking, hooded flowers that resemble a torch, with a deep purple or reddish hue. The plant is a terrestrial orchid, typically growing in moist, shaded environments within forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has a short blooming period, making it a rare sight in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
