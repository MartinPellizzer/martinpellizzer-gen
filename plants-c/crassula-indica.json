    "intro": "Crassula indica, commonly known as the African snowball, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, rounded rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to form offsets makes it easy to propagate and maintain."
