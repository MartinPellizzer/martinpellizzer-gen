    "intro": "Cleistes moritzii, commonly known as the Moritz's orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, hooded flower structure that resembles a closed cup, with a deep violet to purple hue. The plant is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically small, with intricate patterns of purple and white, and it produces a fragrant scent to attract specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss, Cleistes moritzii is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
