    "intro": "Coriflora scottii, commonly known as the Scott's coriflora, is a rare and distinctive flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats and has a short lifespan, often completing its life cycle within a single growing season. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
