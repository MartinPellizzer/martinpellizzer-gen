    "intro": "Costus dussii, commonly known as the red costus, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes gingers, and is characterized by its distinctive, aromatic leaves. The plant produces striking red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Costus dussii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
