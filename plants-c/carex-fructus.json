    "intro": "Carex fructus, commonly known as the fruiting sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-lobed, berry-like structures called nutlets, which are typically red or black in color. Carex fructus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
