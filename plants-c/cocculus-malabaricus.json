    "intro": "Cocculus malabaricus, commonly known as the Indian devil's backbone, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of India and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, warty, and often twisted stems. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into rough, spiny fruits. Its leaves are typically alternate, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture. Cocculus malabaricus is valued in traditional medicine for its potential medicinal properties, though its use is often limited due to its toxic nature."
