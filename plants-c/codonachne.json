    "intro": "Codonachne, commonly known as the narrow-leafed grass or narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. Codonachne species are typically found in temperate regions and thrive in well-drained soils. The plants are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil. They produce small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into achene fruits."
