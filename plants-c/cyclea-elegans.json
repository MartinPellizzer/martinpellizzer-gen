    "intro": "Cyclea elegans, commonly known as the elegant cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
