    "intro": "Callicoma serratifolia f. ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty-fruited hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, often woody growth habit and its distinctive, serrated leaves that are typically covered in a rusty-colored pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, followed by woody, urn-shaped fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and hardy nature."
