    "intro": "Conyza glomerata, commonly known as blueweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. The plant has small, blue to purple flowers that are clustered in dense heads, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a serrated edge, while its stems are erect and branching. Conyza glomerata is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
