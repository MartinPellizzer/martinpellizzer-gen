It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Chloris filiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
