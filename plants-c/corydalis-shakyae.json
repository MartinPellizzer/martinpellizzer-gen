    "intro": "Corydalis shakyae, commonly known as the Shaky Valley Corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Nepal and northern India. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and branching. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
