    "intro": "Cotyledon caryophyllacea, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Cotyledon caryophyllacea is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
