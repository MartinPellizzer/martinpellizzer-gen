    "intro": "Croton densiflorus, commonly known as the denseflower croton, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, often brightly colored leaves that can range from green to red, orange, or yellow. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in dense inflorescences, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically thick and leathery, with a rough texture, and it has a tendency to shed leaves seasonally. Croton densiflorus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant due to its striking foliage."
