    "intro": "Colona merguensis, commonly known as the Merguensis colona, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture, adapted to thrive in cool, moist environments. It is known for its unique ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, which helps it survive in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, Colona merguensis is considered a vulnerable species and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
