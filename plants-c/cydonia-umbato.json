    "intro": "Cydonia umbato, commonly known as the Chinese quince, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China and Southeast Asia. It produces fragrant, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by ornamental, apple-like fruits that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens in temperate climates. Its fruit is used in traditional Chinese medicine and can be cooked to make jams and jellies. The leaves are alternate and oval, with a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value."
