    "intro": "Crepis runcinata var. aculeolata, commonly known as the hooked thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its fuzzy, bristly leaves and stems provide a unique texture, while its flowers attract various pollinators. The variety aculeolata is distinguished by its more pronounced hooks and aculeolate (spiny) structures on the leaves."
