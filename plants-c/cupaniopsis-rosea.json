    "intro": "Cupaniopsis rosea, commonly known as the pink hakea, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Cupaniopsis rosea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in arid conditions."
