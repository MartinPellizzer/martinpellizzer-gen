    "intro": "Carex pterocaulos, commonly known as the broad-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Carex pterocaulos is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
