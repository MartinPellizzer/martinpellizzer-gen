It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is extensive and capable of fixing nitrogen, making it useful for soil stabilization. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments."
