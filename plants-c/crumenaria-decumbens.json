    "intro": "Crumenaria decumbens, commonly known as the creeping crumenaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features a sprawling, prostrate growth habit with slender stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or white in color, clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Crumenaria decumbens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks."
