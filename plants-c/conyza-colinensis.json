    "intro": "Conyza colinensis, commonly known as the common cudweed, is an annual flowering plant native to Eurasia and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. It has hairy stems and leaves with a serrated edge, and its small white or yellow flowers bloom in the summer. Conyza colinensis is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
