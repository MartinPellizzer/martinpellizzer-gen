    "intro": "Cattleya tenebrosa var. marlfield, commonly known as the Marlfield dark cattleya, is a hybrid orchid prized for its striking dark green to blackish foliage and showy, fragrant flowers. Native to Brazil, this variety thrives in warm, humid climates with bright indirect light. Its flowers typically bloom in shades of pink, red, and orange, with a distinctive dark throat that adds to its visual appeal. The plant is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in a horizontal stem with new growths emerging from the base. It requires well-draining soil and regular watering to maintain optimal health and flowering."
