    "intro": "Cariniana pyriformis, commonly known as the Brazilian chestnut or pirul, is a species of tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces edible fruits that are encased in a hard, spiky shell. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has a dense, rounded crown. Its wood is highly valued for its strength and durability, making it an important resource in local economies. However, the species is threatened by habitat loss and disease, leading to its classification as endangered in some regions."
