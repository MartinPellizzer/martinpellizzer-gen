It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, making it an important component of biodiversity in its native environment."
