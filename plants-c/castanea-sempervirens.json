    "intro": "Castanea sempervirens, commonly known as the sweet chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces catkin-like male flowers and female flowers that develop into spiny, woody fruits containing one or two edible nuts. The nuts are encased in a thick, hairy husk and are often harvested in the fall. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in forestry and cuisine."
