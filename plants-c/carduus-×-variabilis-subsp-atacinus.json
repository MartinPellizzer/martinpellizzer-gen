    "intro": "Carduus \u00d7 variabilis subsp. atacinus, commonly known as the variable thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and a tall, branched stem that bears purple to pinkish flower heads. The plant produces composite flowers composed of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, fields, and along roadsides. Due to its robust growth and adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
