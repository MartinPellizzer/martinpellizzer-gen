    "intro": "Caprifolium tenuiflorum, commonly known as narrow-flower honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its slender stems and small, fragrant flowers. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge, while the flowers are usually white or pale yellow. It produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks."
