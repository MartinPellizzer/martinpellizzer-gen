It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves that grow in a basal rosette, and it produces a tall, leafless stem that bears the inflorescence. Crinum guianense is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking floral display and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
