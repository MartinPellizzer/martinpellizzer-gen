    "intro": "Cordia inermis, commonly known as the smooth cordia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Cordia inermis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some cultures."
