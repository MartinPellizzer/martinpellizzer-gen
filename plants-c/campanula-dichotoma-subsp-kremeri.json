It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks."
