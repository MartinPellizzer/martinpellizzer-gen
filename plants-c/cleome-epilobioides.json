    "intro": "Cleome epilobioides, commonly known as spider flower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an annual herb that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers with four petals, which bloom from summer to fall. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Cleome epilobioides is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
