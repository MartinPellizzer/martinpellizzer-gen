    "intro": "Caladenia chapmanii, commonly known as the Chapman's spider orchid, is a striking terrestrial orchid native to Western Australia. It features a slender, erect stem with a single, spider-like flower that is typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a narrow, grass-like leaf and produces a delicate, spurred labellum that is characteristic of the orchid family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
