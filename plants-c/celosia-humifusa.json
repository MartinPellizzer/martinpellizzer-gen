    "intro": "Celosia humifusa, commonly known as the flameflower or red flame, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange bracts that resemble flames. The plant typically grows as a low, spreading shrub with fleshy, succulent stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, but the vibrant bracts serve as its primary ornamental feature. Celosia humifusa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower."
