    "intro": "Corallorhiza mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it grows on the trunks of trees and shrubs. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, allowing it to absorb water and minerals from the environment. Due to its specialized growth habits and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
