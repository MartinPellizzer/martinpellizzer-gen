    "intro": "Cirsium albidum subsp. polychromum, commonly known as the white thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It features robust, spiny stems and large, silvery-white to pale blue flowering heads that are composed of numerous small, fluffy florets. The plant typically grows in open grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with rough, hairy surfaces, and the plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. This species is notable for its striking floral display and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
