    "intro": "Cenchrus racemosus, commonly known as the clustergrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used for erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
