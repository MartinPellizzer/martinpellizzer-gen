    "intro": "Coffea diversifolia, commonly known as the variable coffee plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its elliptical to ovate leaves, which are often pubescent and have a distinct venation pattern. It produces small, white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds used for coffee production. However, it is less commonly cultivated for commercial coffee due to its lower yield and specific growing requirements."
