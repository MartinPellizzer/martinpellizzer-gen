    "intro": "Calligonum patens var. remotum, commonly known as the distant spreading saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling form with woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing degraded lands. Its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions makes it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
