    "intro": "Cyclosorus glandafrus, commonly known as the African cyclosorus, is a species of aquatic fern native to southern Africa. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has a creeping rhizome with small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its reproductive structures are spore-bearing, typical of ferns, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range."
