    "intro": "Ctenopteris barathrophylla, commonly known as the hairy sea palm, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its robust, tree-like structure with a thick, woody trunk and fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The fronds are pinnately compound, with numerous leaflets that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy structures. This plant thrives in coastal environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in tidal zones. Its unique morphology and adaptability to saline conditions make it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
