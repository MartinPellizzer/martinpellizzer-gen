    "intro": "Cochemiea dioica subsp. angelensis, commonly known as the Angel's Thorn, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, adapting to harsh desert conditions. This subspecies is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in succulent gardens."
