    "intro": "Cynosurus elegans var. longiaristatus, commonly known as the slender wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, fens, and along water edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, clustered spikelets during the flowering season. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its preferred environment. This variety is distinguished by its elongated, slender leaves compared to the typical form of Cynosurus elegans."
