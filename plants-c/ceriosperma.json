    "intro": "Ceriosperma, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and showy, five-petaled flowers. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, and the plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, hard seeds. Ceriosperma species are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often with deep root systems and succulent stems to store water. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
