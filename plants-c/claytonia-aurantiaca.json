It features basal rosettes of fleshy, oval leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of orange and yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable."
