    "intro": "Cavendishia capitata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or black velvet plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that are typically dark green with a slight sheen. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the late afternoon. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cavendishia capitata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and pleasant scent."
