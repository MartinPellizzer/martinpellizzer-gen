    "intro": "Cucumis cecilii, commonly known as the Cecil cucumber, is a rare and lesser-known species of cucumber native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its small, elongated fruits that are typically green and have a mild, slightly sweet flavor. The plant is a herbaceous vine that thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its botanical features include hairy stems, lobed leaves, and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and unique traits, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
