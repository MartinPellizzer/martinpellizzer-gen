    "intro": "Chascolytrum koelerioides, commonly known as the mountain lily, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous regions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Chascolytrum koelerioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty."
