    "intro": "Croixia xanthochyma, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, terminal spikes. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, often forming dense colonies in marshy areas. Due to its preference for moist environments, it is frequently found along the edges of ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams."
