    "intro": "Cnemidaria horrida, commonly known as the rough-winged scorpionfly, is a unique insect with distinct botanical features. It belongs to the order Mecoptera and is characterized by its elongated body and distinctive, hairy wings. The plant-like appearance of its wings, which resemble leaves, is a key botanical trait. The wings are covered in fine, branched hairs that contribute to its overall texture and structure. This feature aids in camouflage and protection within its natural habitat."
