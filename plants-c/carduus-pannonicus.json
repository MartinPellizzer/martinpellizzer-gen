    "intro": "Carduus pannonicus, commonly known as the Pannonian thistle, is a perennial herb native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its deep root system allows it to tolerate poor soil conditions and survive in arid environments."
