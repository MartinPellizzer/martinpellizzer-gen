    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 schuetzeana, commonly known as the Schuetze's sedge, is a hybrid plant in the Carex genus, belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, cylindrical spikelets that bear small, three-lobed flowers. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for wetland restoration and garden landscapes. It is native to North America and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other moist habitats. Its ornamental value comes from its dense, upright growth habit and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
