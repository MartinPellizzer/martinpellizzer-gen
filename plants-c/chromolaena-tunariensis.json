    "intro": "Chromolaena tunariensis, commonly known as the tropical weed or false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It is often considered an invasive species in regions outside its native habitat due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
