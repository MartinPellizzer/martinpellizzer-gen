    "intro": "Columnea localis, commonly known as the red-tailed columnea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, while its stems are woody and branched. Columnea localis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is relatively easy to care for in the right growing conditions."
