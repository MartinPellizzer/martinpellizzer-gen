    "intro": "Cyrtandra grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments. Cyrtandra grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich structure."
