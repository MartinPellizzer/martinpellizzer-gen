    "intro": "Cornus schindleri subsp. schindleri, commonly known as the Schindler's dogwood, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after species in horticulture, particularly for its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
