    "intro": "Cystopteris atomaria, commonly known as the small fern or the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are wiry and often grow close to the ground, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
