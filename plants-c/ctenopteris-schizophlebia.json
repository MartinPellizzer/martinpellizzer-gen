    "intro": "Ctenopteris schizophlebia, commonly known as the split-leaf sea palm, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in shallow marine environments, such as tide pools and rocky shores. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, helping to stabilize coastal sediments. The fronds are often covered in a thick layer of mucilage, which aids in moisture retention and protects against desiccation."
