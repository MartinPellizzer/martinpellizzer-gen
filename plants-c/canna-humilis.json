    "intro": "Canna humilis, commonly known as the dwarf canna, is a herbaceous perennial native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, often with a reddish or purple tinge on the underside. The plant produces striking, spathaceous inflorescences that range in color from yellow to orange, with a central spadix that is typically yellow or red. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Canna humilis is relatively low maintenance and can be propagated through rhizomes or seeds."
