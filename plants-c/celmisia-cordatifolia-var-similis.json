    "intro": "Celmisia cordatifolia var. similis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved celmisia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to New Zealand. It features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
