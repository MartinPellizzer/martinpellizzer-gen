    "intro": "Cordia exaltata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often reddish bark and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich color, making it important in traditional crafts and construction. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its range."
