    "intro": "Cycas maconochiei subsp. viridis, commonly known as the green cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range."
