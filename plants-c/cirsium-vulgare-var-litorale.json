    "intro": "Cirsium vulgare var. litorale, commonly known as sea thistle, is a coastal plant characterized by its spiny, purple flower heads and silver-green, hairy leaves. It thrives in salty, well-drained soils along shorelines and dunes, demonstrating a high tolerance for maritime conditions. The plant's robust root system helps stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems. Its flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. This variant is distinct from the typical Cirsium vulgare due to its adaptations to saline environments."
