    "intro": "Cirsium falconeri, commonly known as the Falconer's thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its spiny, purple-tinged leaves and large, showy purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in stiff, bristly hairs. Cirsium falconeri plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
