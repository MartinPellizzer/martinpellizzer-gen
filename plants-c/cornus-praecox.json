    "intro": "Cornus praecox, commonly known as early white dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features slender, arching branches and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red or pink berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Cornus praecox is valued for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
