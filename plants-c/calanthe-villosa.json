    "intro": "Calanthe villosa, commonly known as the hairy calanthe, is a species of orchid native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant typically produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually ovate and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Calanthe villosa prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
