    "intro": "Cleistes speciosa, commonly known as the showy cleistocarp, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Oenotheraceae family and is characterized by its unique, closed flowers that remain tightly shut throughout their blooming period. The plant produces small, egg-shaped fruits called cleistocarps, which open only after the seeds have matured. Cleistes speciosa thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study."
