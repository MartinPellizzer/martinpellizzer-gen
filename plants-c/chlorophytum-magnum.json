    "intro": "Chlorophytum magnum, commonly known as the snake plant, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a silvery-white stripe running down the center. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires minimal watering, making it an ideal houseplant. Its leaves are stiff and fibrous, which helps it store water efficiently. Chlorophytum magnum is also noted for its air-purifying properties, as it can remove toxins from the air."
