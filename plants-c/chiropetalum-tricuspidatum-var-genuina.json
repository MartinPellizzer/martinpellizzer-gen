    "intro": "Chiropetalum tricuspidatum var. genuina, commonly known as the Three-lobed Broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses or other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green in color. It is native to regions of southern Europe and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
