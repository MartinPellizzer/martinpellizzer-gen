    "intro": "Cnicus grahamii, commonly known as Graham's sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are usually lobed and have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and yellow, forming a composite head. Cnicus grahamii is an annual plant that produces seeds through a process called cleistogamy, where flowers close and self-pollinate before opening."
