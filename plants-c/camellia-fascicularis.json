    "intro": "Camellia fascicularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved camellia, is a species native to China and Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that produces showy, camellia-like flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant has elliptical, glossy leaves that are typically narrower than those of other camellia species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Camellia fascicularis is also valued for its winter blooming habit, adding color to gardens during the colder months."
