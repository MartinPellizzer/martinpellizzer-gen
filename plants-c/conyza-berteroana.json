    "intro": "Conyza berteroana, commonly known as the common ragweed, is an annual flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces a large amount of lightweight, wind-dispersed pollen, which can cause allergic reactions in humans. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in agricultural fields. Conyza berteroana is considered a weed in many regions due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
