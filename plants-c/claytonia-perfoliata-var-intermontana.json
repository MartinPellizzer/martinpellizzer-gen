    "intro": "Claytonia perfoliata var. intermontana, commonly known as the Sierra sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, grass-like leaves that form a dense mat. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its unique leaf structure, which appears to \"perfoliate\" the stem, is a notable botanical feature."
