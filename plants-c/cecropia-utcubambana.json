    "intro": "Cecropia utcubambana, commonly known as the giant cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, hollow stems. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as forest edges and clearings, where it thrives in full sunlight. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in humid environments. The tree plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various animals and insects."
