The plant has tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. Calamagrostis transsylvanica is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting wetland biodiversity."
