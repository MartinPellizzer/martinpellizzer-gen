    "intro": "Cerastium tomentosum subsp. lanigerum, commonly known as the woolly mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or grayish foliage, which gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fibrous roots and compact growth habit make it well-suited for ground cover in moist, temperate climates."
