    "intro": "Cyperus tersus, commonly known as swamp spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its slender, grass-like stems are often clustered, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters. Cyperus tersus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
