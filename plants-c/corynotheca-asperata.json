    "intro": "Corynotheca asperata, commonly known as the rough-seeded sandmat, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are linear and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in the plant's survival in harsh environments."
