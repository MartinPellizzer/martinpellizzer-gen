    "intro": "Cestrum laurifolium f. grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaved nightshade, is a variant of the evergreen shrub native to Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, glossy, dark green leaves that are larger than those of the typical Cestrum laurifolium. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its fruits are red, fleshy berries that mature in the fall. This cultivar is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers."
