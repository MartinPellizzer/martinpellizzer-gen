    "intro": "Calanthe gigantea, commonly known as the giant calanthe, is a striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, often in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves and grows as a terrestrial orchid, often forming dense clumps. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, typically in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
