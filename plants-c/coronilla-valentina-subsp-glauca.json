It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in improving soil fertility."
