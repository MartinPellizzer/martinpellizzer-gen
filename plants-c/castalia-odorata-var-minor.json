It features aromatic, dark green leaves that are glossy and lance-shaped, with a pleasant fragrance when crushed. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It is well-suited for container gardening due to its manageable size and ability to thrive in partial shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor spaces in warm climates."
