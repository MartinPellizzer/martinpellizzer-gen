    "intro": "Canarium sibuyanense, commonly known as the Sibuyan nut or Sibuyan canarium, is a species of flowering plant in the Burseraceae family. It is native to the Philippines, specifically the island of Sibuyan, and is known for its unique ecological and botanical features. The plant is a small to medium-sized tree with smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed surrounded by a hard, woody shell. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Canarium sibuyanense is considered a rare and endangered species."
