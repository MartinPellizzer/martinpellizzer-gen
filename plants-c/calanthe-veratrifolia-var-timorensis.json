    "intro": "Calanthe veratrifolia var. timorensis, commonly known as the Timor calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the island of Timor. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within montane forests. Its flowers often bloom during the cooler months, adding a unique ornamental value to its habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
