    "intro": "Croton tiglium, commonly known as the blistering croton, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves and distinctive, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a milky latex sap that contains toxic compounds, including tiglic acid and croton oil. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny capsule and are often used in traditional medicine, though with caution due to its potent effects. The plant's botanical features make it both a subject of scientific study and a plant with significant ecological and medicinal importance."
