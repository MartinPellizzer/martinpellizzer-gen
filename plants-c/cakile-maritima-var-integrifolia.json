    "intro": "Cakile maritima var. integrifolia, commonly known as the coastal rock cress, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the western coast of the United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and has small, pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds. Its robust root system helps stabilize dunes and prevent erosion in coastal environments."
