    "intro": "Carex pisiformis f. musashiensis, commonly known as the Musashi sedge, is a variant of the broadleaf sedge. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Japan, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, which helps it spread and colonize new areas. The foliage is often used in traditional Japanese landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
