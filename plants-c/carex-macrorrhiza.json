It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences composed of numerous small, spike-like clusters of flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Carex macrorrhiza is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
