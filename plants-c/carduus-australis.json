    "intro": "Carduus australis, commonly known as the Australian thistle, is a perennial plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. It has a robust root system that allows it to survive in harsh environmental conditions. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native flora in certain areas."
