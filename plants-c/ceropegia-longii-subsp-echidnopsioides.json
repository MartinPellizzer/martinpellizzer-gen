    "intro": "Ceropegia longii subsp. echidnopsioides, commonly known as the Cape mountain sand orchid, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, branching stems covered in small, leaf-like structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces delicate, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale green, adapted for specific pollinators. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in arid gardens and conservation efforts."
