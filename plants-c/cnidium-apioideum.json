    "intro": "Cnidium apioideum, commonly known as the Chinese snakegrass, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, often finely divided leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its rhizomes and roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
