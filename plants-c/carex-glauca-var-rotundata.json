    "intro": "Carex glauca var. rotundata, commonly known as blue sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that exhibits a striking blue-green hue due to the presence of a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
