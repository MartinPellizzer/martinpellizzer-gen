    "intro": "Cassine dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branch cassine, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, branched structure and small, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. Cassine dichotoma is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
