    "intro": "Chamaesyce koerneriana, commonly known as the Koerner's spurge, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain regions."
