    "intro": "Colletia dumosa, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine, whitish coating to reduce water loss. Colletia dumosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators in desert ecosystems."
