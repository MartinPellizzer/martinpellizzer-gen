It belongs to the family Cupressaceae and is characterized by its narrow, cylindrical cones and scale-like leaves. The tree is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its wood is dense and durable, making it valuable for construction and furniture-making. Callitris suissii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
