    "intro": "Convolvulus lupulifolia, commonly known as the hop-vine, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its common name reflects its resemblance to the hop plant, though it is not related botanically."
