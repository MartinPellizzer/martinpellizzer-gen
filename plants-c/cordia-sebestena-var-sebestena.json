    "intro": "Cordia sebestena var. sebestena, commonly known as the red cedar or red gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forest and scrubland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for reforestation projects."
