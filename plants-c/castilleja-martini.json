    "intro": "Castilleja martini, commonly known as the California paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tube-like flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for nutrients, often growing on the roots of grasses and other shrubs. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations. Castilleja martini is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun."
