    "intro": "Ctenitis subincisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in shaded, moist environments. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Ctenitis subincisa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
