    "intro": "Carex milnei, commonly known as Milne's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex milnei is often found in association with other native flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
