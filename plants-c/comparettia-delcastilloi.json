    "intro": "Comparettia delcastilloi, commonly known as the Castillo's comparettia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It features elongated, narrow leaves and produces showy, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that adds to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
