It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, sky-blue to violet flowers. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
