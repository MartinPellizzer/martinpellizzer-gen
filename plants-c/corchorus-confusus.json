It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and produces small, greenish flowers clustered in cyathia. It is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
