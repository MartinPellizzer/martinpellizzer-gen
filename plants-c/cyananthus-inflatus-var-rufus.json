    "intro": "Cyananthus inflatus var. rufus, commonly known as the red-flowered bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range from blue to purple with a reddish tinge. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. This variant is distinguished by its more intense red coloration compared to the typical blue-flowered form of Cyananthus inflatus."
