    "intro": "Camaridium horichii, commonly known as the Horichii's camara, is a rare and endangered plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, waxy leaves that are typically deep green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Camaridium horichii is critically endangered and requires urgent protection."
