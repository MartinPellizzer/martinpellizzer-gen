    "intro": "Caraipa richardiana var. distorta, commonly known as the twisted caraipa, is a unique variant of the Caraipa richardiana species native to the Andean regions of South America. This plant is characterized by its distinctive, twisted growth pattern, which gives it a visually striking appearance. It is a shrub-like plant with woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a pale yellow or greenish hue. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
