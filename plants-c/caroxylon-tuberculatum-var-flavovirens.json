    "intro": "Caroxylon tuberculatum var. flavovirens, commonly known as the golden-green cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that are a striking combination of green and yellow. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of gymnosperms, and exhibits a slow growth rate. Its unique coloration and morphology make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
