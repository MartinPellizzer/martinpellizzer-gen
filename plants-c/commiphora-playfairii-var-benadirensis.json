    "intro": "Commiphora playfairii var. benadirensis, commonly known as the Benadirensis myrrh tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Africa. It produces aromatic, resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and incense. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically clustered in panicle-like inflorescences. The bark and leaves are the primary sources of the resin, which has a distinctive balsamic aroma. This species is adapted to dry, tropical climates and is often found in coastal and lowland areas."
