    "intro": "Coelogyne woodiana, commonly known as the Wood's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters of 10 to 20 on a sturdy scape. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the air and rain, typical of orchids growing on trees. The species is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its striking floral display."
