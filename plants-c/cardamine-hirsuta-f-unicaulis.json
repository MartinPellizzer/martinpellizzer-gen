    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta f. unicaulis, commonly known as the unique-stemed lady's mantle, is a rare variant of the common lady's mantle. It is characterized by its distinctive single, unbranched stem, which sets it apart from the typical bushy growth of the species. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in a shield-like cluster, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its hirsute appearance. This form is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
