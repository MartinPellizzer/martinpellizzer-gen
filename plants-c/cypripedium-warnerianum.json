    "intro": "Cypripedium warnerianum, commonly known as the Warner's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the center. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forests at high elevations, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem during the spring. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
