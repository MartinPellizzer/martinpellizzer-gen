    "intro": "Cerastium nemorale, commonly known as wood mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically forms a mat of hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Cerastium nemorale is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
