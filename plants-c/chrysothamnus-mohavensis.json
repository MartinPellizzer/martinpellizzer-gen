    "intro": "Chrysothamnus mohavensis, commonly known as Mohave goldenbush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its golden-yellow flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it reflect sunlight in its arid environment. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to hot, dry climates and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
