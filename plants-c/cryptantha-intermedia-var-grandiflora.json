It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in open grasslands and along mountain slopes. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
