    "intro": "Cerastium longirostre subsp. lucorum, commonly known as the slender mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices."
