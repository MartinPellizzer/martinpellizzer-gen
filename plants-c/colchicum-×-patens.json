    "intro": "Colchicum \u00d7 patens, commonly known as the hybrid meadow crocus, is a perennial plant belonging to the Colchicaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant produces a bulbous corm, which serves as its storage organ and allows it to survive harsh winter conditions. It is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic alkaloids that require careful handling."
