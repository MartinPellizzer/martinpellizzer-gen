    "intro": "Celsia rechingeri, commonly known as the Rechinger's celsia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh weather conditions. Celsia rechingeri is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its extreme habitat."
