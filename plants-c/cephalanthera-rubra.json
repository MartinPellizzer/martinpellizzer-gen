    "intro": "Cephalanthera rubra, commonly known as the red helleborine, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb with a slender, erect stem that bears broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist woodlands and is known for its lack of chlorophyll, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients. Cephalanthera rubra is considered a rare and protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
