It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near water bodies. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
