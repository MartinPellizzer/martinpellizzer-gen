    "intro": "Clematis phaseolifolia, commonly known as the greenbrier clematis, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, resembling those of beans, hence its species name *phaseolifolia*. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring. Its stems are covered in fine, hooked hairs, which aid in climbing. The plant thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soils."
