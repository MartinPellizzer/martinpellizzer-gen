    "intro": "Calpigyne, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Rhizophoraceae. It is characterized by its salt-tolerant properties, allowing it to thrive in coastal and brackish water environments. The plant has aerial roots that help it anchor in soft, muddy substrates and facilitate gas exchange. Its leaves are usually small,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Calpigyne plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
