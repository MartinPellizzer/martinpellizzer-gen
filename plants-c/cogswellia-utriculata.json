    "intro": "Cogswellia utriculata, commonly known as the starfish cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its flat, ribbed stems that resemble the arms of a starfish, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and distinct appearance, it is a popular choice among collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
