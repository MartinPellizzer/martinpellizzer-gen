    "intro": "Cinchona pubescens var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple bark cinchona, is a species native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dark, purplish bark, which is rich in alkaloids, particularly quinine, historically used in the treatment of malaria. The plant is a small evergreen tree or shrub, typically growing to a height of 3\u20136 meters. Its leaves are ovate and dark green, with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries. This variety is valued both for its medicinal properties and its role in traditional herbal medicine."
