    "intro": "Cypella, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the small, yellow flowers. These bracts are often mistaken for leaves, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. Cypella species are typically found in coastal areas and rocky habitats, thriving in saline and well-drained soils. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
