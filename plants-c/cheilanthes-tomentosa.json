    "intro": "Cheilanthes tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly cliff brake, is a species of fern native to arid and rocky environments in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit, with fronds that are typically gray-green in color. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of fine, hairy tissue. This adaptation allows it to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained soils where few other plants can survive."
