    "intro": "Crepidium palawense, commonly known as the Palau orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the island nation of Palau in the western Pacific. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that aids in pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
