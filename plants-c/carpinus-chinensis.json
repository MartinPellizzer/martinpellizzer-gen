It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, spiky fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for ornamental and ecological landscaping."
