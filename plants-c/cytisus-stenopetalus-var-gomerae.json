    "intro": "Cytisus stenopetalus var. gomerae, commonly known as the Gomera broom, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is adapted to the mild, humid climate of its native region. It is often found in coastal and open woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
