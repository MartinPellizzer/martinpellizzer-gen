    "intro": "Cycas beddomei, commonly known as the Borneo cycad, is a unique species native to the island of Borneo. It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Cycas beddomei is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for centuries in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
