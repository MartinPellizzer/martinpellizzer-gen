    "intro": "Ceratolobus concolor, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, elongated pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Due to its historical use in traditional crafts and its ecological importance, it is also of conservation concern in some areas."
