    "intro": "Cheilanthes castanea, commonly known as the chestnut fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial plant that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in forested areas and along stream banks. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces fronds that are typically lance-shaped and have a leathery texture. Its spores are released from sori that are arranged in a single row along the underside of the fronds. Cheilanthes castanea is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
