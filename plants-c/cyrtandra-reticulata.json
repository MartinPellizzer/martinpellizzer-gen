    "intro": "Cyrtandra reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a distinct net-like venation pattern, which gives it its scientific name. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Cyrtandra reticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
