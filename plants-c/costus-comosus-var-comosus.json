    "intro": "Costus comosus var. comosus, commonly known as the spiked costus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial with tall, upright stems that bear narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking clusters of orange-red bracts, which are not flowers but modified leaves that attract pollinators. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for tropical gardens and indoor cultivation."
