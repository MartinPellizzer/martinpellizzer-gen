    "intro": "Cereus lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's night bloomer, is a cacti species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and spines, which help it survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in low rainfall conditions. Cereus lehmannii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique flowering habit."
