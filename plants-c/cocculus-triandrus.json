    "intro": "Cocculus triandrus, commonly known as the devil's fig, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, violet to blue flowers. The plant produces a fleshy, orange-red fruit that contains several seeds. Its roots and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported analgesic and antispasmodic properties. However, the plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested."
