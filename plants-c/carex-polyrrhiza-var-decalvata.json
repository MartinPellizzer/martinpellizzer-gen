    "intro": "Carex polyrrhiza var. decalvata, commonly known as the smoothleaf sedgeland, is a variant of the broad-leaved sedgeland found in wetland habitats. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often in marshes or along the edges of ponds. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
