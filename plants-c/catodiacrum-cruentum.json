    "intro": "Catodiacrum cruentum, commonly known as the blood fern, is a species of fern native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its striking appearance and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
