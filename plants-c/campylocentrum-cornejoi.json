    "intro": "Campylocentrum cornejoi, commonly known as the Corsican star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Corsica. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that display a vibrant combination of purple and white hues. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
