It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments. Cupaniopsis flagelliformis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and attractive form."
