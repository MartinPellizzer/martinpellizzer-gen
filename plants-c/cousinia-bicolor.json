    "intro": "Cousinia bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow and purple flowers that bloom in summer, adding vibrant color to its harsh environment. The plant has basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its stem is upright and covered with rough, hairy texture, supporting the inflorescence of yellow flowers. Cousinia bicolor is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun and exhibiting drought tolerance."
