    "intro": "Cephalotaxus fortunei var. lanceolata, commonly known as the Chinese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to China. It features lanceolate, dark green leaves that are arranged spirally along the stems. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its dense, compact form. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
