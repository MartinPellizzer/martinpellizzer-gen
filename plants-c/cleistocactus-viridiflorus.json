    "intro": "Cleistocactus viridiflorus, commonly known as the green-flowered cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a small, spiny cactus that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features a short, cylindrical stem with dense, white to yellowish spines. Its flowers are greenish-white, often with a faint yellow tinge, and open only at night. Cleistocactus viridiflorus is adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its fleshy stem and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture from the soil."
