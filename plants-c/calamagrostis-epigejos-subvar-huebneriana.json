    "intro": "Calamagrostis epigejos subvar. huebneriana, commonly known as the Hungarian milletgrass, is a perennial grass native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate texture to the landscape. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. This subvariety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
