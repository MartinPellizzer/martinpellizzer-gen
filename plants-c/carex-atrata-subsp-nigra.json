    "intro": "Carex atrata subsp. nigra, commonly known as black sedge, is a perennial plant native to northern regions of North America. It typically grows in wet to moist habitats such as bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features dark green, grass-like leaves that are often densely packed, forming a rosette-like structure. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, brownish flowers that are clustered in a loose arrangement. The subspecies is characterized by its dark, almost blackish coloration of the leaves and stems, which distinguishes it from other Carex species."
