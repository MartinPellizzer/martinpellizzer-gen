It is a member of the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its linear, grass-like leaves and tall, branched stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are typically green or yellowish.

The plant thrives in moist, tropical climates and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks."
