    "intro": "Capparidastrum, commonly known as the bottle tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Capparaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, bottle-shaped stems that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. They are native to regions of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of Asia. The leaves are typically alternate and pinnate, while the flowers are small and often yellow or green. Capparidastrum species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological role in desert ecosystems."
