    "intro": "Campanula incanescens var. mollis, commonly known as the Downy Bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and prefers well-drained, rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cool, dry climates. The variety mollis is distinguished by its particularly dense, downy covering on the leaves and stems, giving it a soft, woolly appearance."
