    "intro": "Calamagrostis borii, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, tufted growth habit, adapted to cold and arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
