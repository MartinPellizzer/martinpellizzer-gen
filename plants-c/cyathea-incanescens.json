    "intro": "Cyathea incanescens, commonly known as the silver tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, trunk-like stem covered in a dense layer of dead fronds. The plant produces large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length, with a distinctive silvery-white underside. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Cyathea incanescens is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appearance."
