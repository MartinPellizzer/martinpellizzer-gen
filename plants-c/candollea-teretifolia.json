    "intro": "Candollea teretifolia, commonly known as the slender leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often tinged with brown at the tips. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces roots that help anchor it to the substrate. Candollea teretifolia is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
