    "intro": "Carex scoparia var. aggregata, commonly known as the clustered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically green to brown in color. This variety is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
