    "intro": "Chitonia, commonly known as the sea hare, is a type of marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Aplysiidae. It is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and often vibrant coloration, which can serve as a form of camouflage or warning to predators. Chitonia species are typically found in shallow coastal waters and are known for their ability to secrete a mucus that aids in locomotion and protection. They play an important role in marine ecosystems by grazing on algae and contributing to nutrient cycling. Their anatomy includes a radula, a specialized feeding structure used to scrape food from surfaces."
