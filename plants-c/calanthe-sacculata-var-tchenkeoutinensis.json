    "intro": "Calanthe sacculata var. tchenkeoutinensis, commonly known as the Tchenkeoutin's calanthe, is a rare orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually elliptical and glossy, while the inflorescence consists of a raceme of small to medium-sized blooms. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this variety is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
