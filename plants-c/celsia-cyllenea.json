    "intro": "Celsia cyllenea, commonly known as the mountain celsia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features a rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a terminal cluster, which bloom in late summer. Its fibrous roots are known for their ability to store water, aiding survival in harsh environments. Celsia cyllenea is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
