    "intro": "Coeloglossum viride f. gracillimum, commonly known as the slender green hawksbeard, is a rare and delicate perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, greenish-yellow flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its narrow leaves and compact growth habit make it a unique addition to specialized botanical collections. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
