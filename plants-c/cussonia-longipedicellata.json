It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that mature to a dark red color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some regions for its attractive foliage and unique growth form."
