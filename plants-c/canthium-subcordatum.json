It is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it a cautionary plant in its native habitat."
