It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense, compact cluster. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically yellow or brown in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or near water bodies. Cyperus sphaerocephalus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
