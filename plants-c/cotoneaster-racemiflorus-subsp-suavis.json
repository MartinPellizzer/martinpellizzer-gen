    "intro": "Cotoneaster racemiflorus subsp. suavis, commonly known as the fragrant cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that emit a subtle, sweet fragrance, particularly in the spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are attractive to birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are typically ovate with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
