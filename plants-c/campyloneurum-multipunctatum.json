    "intro": "Campyloneurum multipunctatum, commonly known as the punctate fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often adorned with small, raised dots or punctations along the veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or near streams. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable in its native habitat."
