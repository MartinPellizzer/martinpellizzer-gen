    "intro": "Cyrtochilum portillae, commonly known as the Portilla's orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb and produces intricate, fragrant blooms that are often clustered near the base of the stem. Cyrtochilum portillae is adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to thrive, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
