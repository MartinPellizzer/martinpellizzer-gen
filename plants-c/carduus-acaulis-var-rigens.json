    "intro": "Carduus acaulis var. rigens, commonly known as the rigid thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its sturdy, upright stems and spiny leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to violet flower heads that are composed of numerous small florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but also has historical uses in herbal medicine."
