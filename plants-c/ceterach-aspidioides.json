    "intro": "Ceterach aspidioides, commonly known as the giant feather moss, is a species of liverwort found in coastal and wetland habitats. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth and dark green, leathery leaves that are often arranged in overlapping rows. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in association with other moisture-loving flora. Its structure consists of a thallus, which is the main body of the liverwort, and it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense. Ceterach aspidioides plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates."
