It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its vibrant, showy bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as savannas and grasslands. Its leaves are often hairy and have a distinctive, lance-shaped form. While it is not widely cultivated for ornamental purposes, it plays a role in local ecosystems as a source of nectar for pollinators."
