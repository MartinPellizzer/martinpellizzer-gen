    "intro": "Cereus papillosus, commonly known as the \"pencil cactus,\" is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that resemble bamboo, which are covered in small, white, hair-like structures called papillae. The plant produces striking, night-blooming flowers that are typically pink or white, which open only during the evening. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Cereus papillosus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
