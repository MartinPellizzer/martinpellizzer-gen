    "intro": "Carex scoparia var. condensa, commonly known as the dense sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color. Native to the northern regions of North America, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in three rows, and it produces flowers in late summer. It is valued in wetland restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
