    "intro": "Centaurium compressum, commonly known as the slender centaury, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters and features narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or violet, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. These flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Centaurium compressum is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
