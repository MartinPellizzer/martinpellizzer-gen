    "intro": "Caprificus, commonly known as the common privet, is a genus of flowering plants in the Oleaceae family. It includes species native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, often found in woodland and scrub habitats. The plants are shrubs or small trees, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with opposite, simple, and often aromatic leaves. Caprificus species produce small, yellowish-green flowers that are usually clustered in racemes, followed by small, fleshy berries. These plants are valued for their ornamental qualities and are commonly used in landscaping and hedging."
