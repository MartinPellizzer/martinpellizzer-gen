    "intro": "Cousinia xanthula, commonly known as the yellow globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, globular growth habit and yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Cousinia xanthula is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability."
