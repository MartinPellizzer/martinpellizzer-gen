    "intro": "Convolvulus meyeri, commonly known as Meyer's bindweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its twining stems allow it to climb or trail along the ground, often forming dense mats. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
