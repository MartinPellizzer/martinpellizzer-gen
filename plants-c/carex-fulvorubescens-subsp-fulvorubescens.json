    "intro": "Carex fulvorubescens subsp. fulvorubescens, commonly known as the red-brown sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often reddish-brown at the base, giving it its common name. It produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers in the summer. This subspecies is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife."
