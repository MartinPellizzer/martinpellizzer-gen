    "intro": "Carex trachycystis, commonly known as the rough-scaled sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are often covered with small, rough, scale-like structures, which give it its common name. Carex trachycystis is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils and is often found in temperate regions of North America."
