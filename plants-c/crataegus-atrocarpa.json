    "intro": "Crataegus atrocarpa, commonly known as the blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny branches and dark, shiny berries that ripen in the fall. The plant has small, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. The berries are an important food source for birds and wildlife, and the plant is often used in hedgerows and landscape design."
