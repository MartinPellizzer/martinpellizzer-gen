    "intro": "Calotheca arabica, commonly known as the Arabian calotheca, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep root systems and thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calotheca arabica is considered a vulnerable species."
