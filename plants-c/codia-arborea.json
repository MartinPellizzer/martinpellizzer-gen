    "intro": "Codia arborea, commonly known as the white-flowered codia, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Codia arborea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
