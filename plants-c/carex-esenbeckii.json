It is native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. It features grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences with small, wind-pollinated flowers.
