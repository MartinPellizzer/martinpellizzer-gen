    "intro": "Cerastium glomeratum var. corollinum, commonly known as the clustered mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has rounded, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, aiding in moisture retention. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover."
