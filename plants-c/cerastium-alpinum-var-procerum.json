    "intro": "Cerastium alpinum var. procerum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, hairy, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve heat and moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas with high altitudes. Due to its compact form and frost resistance, it is a common species in alpine vegetation and has ornamental value in gardens."
