    "intro": "Codochisma, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers typically range in color from white to pink and bloom in late summer. Codochisma is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained conditions."
