    "intro": "Cuscuta cephalanthi, commonly known as the dogbane dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It attaches to host plants using haustoria, specialized structures that penetrate the host's vascular system. This species typically parasitizes members of the Apocynaceae family, such as milkweeds and related plants. Its flowers are small and often greenish-white, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
