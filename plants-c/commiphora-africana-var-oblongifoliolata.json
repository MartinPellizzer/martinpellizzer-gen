    "intro": "Commiphora africana var. oblongifoliolata, commonly known as the African myrrh or oblong-leaf myrrh, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to parts of sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, resinous sap, which has been traditionally used in incense and medicinal applications. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are typically oblong to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. This species is often found in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
