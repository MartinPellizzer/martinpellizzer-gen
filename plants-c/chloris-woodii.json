    "intro": "Chloris woodii, commonly known as the Wood's grass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Chloris woodii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
