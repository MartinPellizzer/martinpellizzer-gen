    "intro": "Convolvulus acetosellifolius, commonly known as the lemon-scented morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant is an annual herb that thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves emit a distinct lemon-like fragrance when crushed, which is due to the presence of volatile oils. It is often found in rocky or disturbed areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
