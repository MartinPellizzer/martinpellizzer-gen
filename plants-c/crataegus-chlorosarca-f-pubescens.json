    "intro": "Crataegus chlorosarca f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent hawthorn, is a botanical variant of the hawthorn species characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. This form exhibits a more robust growth habit compared to typical hawthorns, with leaves that are covered in fine pubescence, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters and blooming in early spring. It is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
