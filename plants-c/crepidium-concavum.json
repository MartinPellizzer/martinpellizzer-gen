    "intro": "Crepidium concavum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, erect stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often with a slight purplish tinge, and are arranged in a loose spike. Crepidium concavum is known for its ability to thrive in cooler climates and is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat."
