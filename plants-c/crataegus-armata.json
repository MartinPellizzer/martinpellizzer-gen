    "intro": "Crataegus armata, commonly known as the armed hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. Crataegus armata is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its botanical features make it an important component of native ecosystems and a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
