    "intro": "Cordia pelida, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapting well to drought conditions. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Cordia pelida is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments."
