It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
