    "intro": "Cenchrus scabridus, commonly known as roughhair grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and sturdy, erect stems. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spikelet with bracts that are often hairy. Cenchrus scabridus is adapted to dry conditions and is sometimes used for erosion control due to its extensive root system."
