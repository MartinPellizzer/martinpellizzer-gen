    "intro": "Calyptrogyne panamensis subsp. tutensis, commonly known as the Tut\u00e1n mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Central America. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its woody structure and salt-tolerant adaptations. The plant typically grows in mangrove swamps and estuarine environments, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. Its leaves are alternate and simple, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The species is also notable for its small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences."
