    "intro": "Centaurium somedanum, commonly known as the Ethiopian chickweed, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It is a member of the family Gentianaceae, characterized by its small, tubular flowers and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring cool and moist conditions. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in early spring, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds. Centaurium somedanum is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
