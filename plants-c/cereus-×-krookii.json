It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of vibrant, star-shaped flowers that bloom during the holiday season. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and seasonal blooming make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
