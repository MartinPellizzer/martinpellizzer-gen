    "intro": "Critoniopsis vivarii, commonly known as the vivarium cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, columnar stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by distinctive, spherical fruits. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and conservation efforts."
