It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its deciduous nature, shedding its leaves during the dry season. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in folk medicine for their potential health benefits. The species is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in tropical regions."
