    "intro": "Campanula glomerata var. salviifolia, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it often grows in moist, shady environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens. The variety salviifolia is distinguished by its broader, more salvia-like leaves compared to the typical form."
