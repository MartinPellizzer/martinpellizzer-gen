    "intro": "Cyperus scaettae var. scaettae, commonly known as the Italian flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, ditches, and stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the base of the plant. Cyperus scaettae var. scaettae is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
