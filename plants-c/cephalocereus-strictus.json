It is a columnar cactus with a tall, unbranched stem that can grow up to several meters in height. Its most distinctive feature is its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night and remain open for only a few hours. The plant has spiny areoles and produces small, edible fruits that are typically yellow or red. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
