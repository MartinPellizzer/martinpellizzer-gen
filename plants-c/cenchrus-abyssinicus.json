    "intro": "Cenchrus abyssinicus, commonly known as the Abyssinian grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered at the ends of the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-resistant. Cenchrus abyssinicus is often used for forage and erosion control in its native regions."
