It is characterized by its striking, often violet or purple-hued flowers that feature a unique, intricate structure with a specialized pollination mechanism. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are designed to attract specific pollinators, such as bees and wasps, through a combination of color, scent, and nectar. The genus Catasetum is known for its complex pollination system, which involves the transfer of pollen via a specialized structure called the galea."
