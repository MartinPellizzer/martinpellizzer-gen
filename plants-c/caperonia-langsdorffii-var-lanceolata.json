    "intro": "Caperonia langsdorffii var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate caperonia, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of South America. It features erect, branched stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its fibrous roots are adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. This variant is distinguished by its elongated leaf shape and is often found in coastal or lowland rainforests."
