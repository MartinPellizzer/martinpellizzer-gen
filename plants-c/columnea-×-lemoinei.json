    "intro": "Columnea \u00d7 lemoinei, commonly known as the hybrid flame flower, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Columnea rubra and Columnea tetragona. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Venezuela. This plant is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting hummingbirds and other pollinators. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The plant is often cultivated as a decorative foliage plant due to its striking appearance and ease of care."
