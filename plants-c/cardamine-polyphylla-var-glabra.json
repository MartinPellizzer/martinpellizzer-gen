    "intro": "Cardamine polyphylla var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. The plant features alternate, trifoliate leaves that are smooth and often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
