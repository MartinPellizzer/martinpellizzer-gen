    "intro": "Cheilanthes cinnamomea, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant has a distinctive, creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Cheilanthes cinnamomea thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and rocky areas."
