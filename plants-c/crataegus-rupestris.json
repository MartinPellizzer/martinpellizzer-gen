    "intro": "Crataegus rupestris, commonly known as the rock hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Crataegus rupestris thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open fields. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat."
