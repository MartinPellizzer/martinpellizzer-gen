    "intro": "Cactus depressus, commonly known as the flat-topped cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and flattened, ribbed stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often clustered at the ends of the stems. Its thick, waxy cuticle helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Cactus depressus is well adapted to desert conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant in its native habitat."
