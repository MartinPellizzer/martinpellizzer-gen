    "intro": "Chascanum insulare var. canescens, commonly known as the Andean sunflower, is a herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets and dark brown disk florets, which give it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are hairy and grayish in color, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Andean medicine."
