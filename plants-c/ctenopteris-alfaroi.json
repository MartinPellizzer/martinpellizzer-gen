    "intro": "Ctenopteris alfaroi, commonly known as the Alfaroi's sea holly, is a species of marine fern that thrives in intertidal zones. It is characterized by its unique fronds that are adapted to withstand saltwater spray and tidal forces. The plant's reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, spore-bearing clusters along the fronds. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for small marine organisms. This species is found primarily in the Indo-Pacific region, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Philippines."
