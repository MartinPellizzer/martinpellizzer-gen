    "intro": "Carduus cephalanthus, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. The leaves are usually lobed and have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
