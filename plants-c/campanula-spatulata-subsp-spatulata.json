    "intro": "Campanula spatulata subsp. spatulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features upright stems that bear opposite, ovate to broadly ovate leaves with a distinctive broad, rounded base. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
