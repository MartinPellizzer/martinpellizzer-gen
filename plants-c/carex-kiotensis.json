    "intro": "Carex kiotensis, commonly known as the Japanese sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. It produces small, clustered spikelets that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. Carex kiotensis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
