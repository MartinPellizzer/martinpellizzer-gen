It belongs to the family Helicidae and is characterized by its distinctive spiral shell that is often tinged with purple or pink hues. The shell is typically smooth and has a conical shape, providing protection for the soft body inside. This species is found in various parts of Europe and is often associated with moist, shaded environments. Its diet consists mainly of decaying plant matter, contributing to the decomposition process in its habitat."
