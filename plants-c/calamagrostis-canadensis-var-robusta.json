    "intro": "Calamagrostis canadensis var. robusta, commonly known as Canadian reed grass, is a tall, perennial grass native to North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a distinctive silver-white underside. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for wildlife and stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
