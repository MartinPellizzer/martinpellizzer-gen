    "intro": "Castilleja ciliata, commonly known as the fringed milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, rounded leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. Castilleja ciliata thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and sagebrush steppe."
