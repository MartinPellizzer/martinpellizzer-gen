    "intro": "Catopsis oerstediana, commonly known as the Oersted's catopsis, is a rare and unique member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often hidden within the leaf rosette. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and challenging plant to cultivate."
