    "intro": "Carex omiana var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in alpine and subalpine environments. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, a common reproductive strategy in its habitat. Due to its ecological significance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in specialized gardens."
