    "intro": "Combretum verticillatum, commonly known as the spiralwood or African flame bush, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves, which gives it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine. The species is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
