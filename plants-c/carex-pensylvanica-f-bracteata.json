    "intro": "Carex pensylvanica f. bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate sedge, is a variant of the Pennsylvania sedge, characterized by its distinctive bract-like structures on its flowering spikes. This perennial plant is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and the inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike that bears small, spikelets. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate wet conditions and its aesthetic appeal in natural landscapes."
