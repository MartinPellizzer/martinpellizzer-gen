    "intro": "Cyperus calopterus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of narrow leaves that resemble an umbrella when viewed from above. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Cyperus calopterus thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a water filtration plant in aquatic ecosystems."
