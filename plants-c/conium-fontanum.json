It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. However, it is toxic and should not be ingested or handled without proper caution."
