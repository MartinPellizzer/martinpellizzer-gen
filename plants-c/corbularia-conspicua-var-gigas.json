    "intro": "Corbularia conspicua var. gigas, commonly known as the giant water lettuce, is a variant of the water lettuce species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, waxy, floating leaves that can grow up to 20 centimeters in diameter. The plant has a rosette-like structure with elongated, thread-like roots that help it anchor in water. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters at the base of the leaves."
