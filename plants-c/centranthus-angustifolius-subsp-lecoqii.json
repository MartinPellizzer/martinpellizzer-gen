    "intro": "Centranthus angustifolius subsp. lecoqii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved redstem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, tubular red or pink flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant is drought-tolerant once established. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
