It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant features slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water surface. This variety is characterized by its uniform leaf morphology, distinguishing it from other variants of Callitriche hamulata."
