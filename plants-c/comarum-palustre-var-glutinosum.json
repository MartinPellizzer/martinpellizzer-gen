    "intro": "Comarum palustre var. glutinosum, commonly known as sticky water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features upright, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which helps in deterring herbivores. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its unique botanical characteristics make it an important species for wetland ecosystems."
