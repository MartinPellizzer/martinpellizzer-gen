    "intro": "Carduus carlinoides subsp. carlinoides, commonly known as the Carlin thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust, upright stem covered in coarse, spiny hairs, and its leaves are deeply lobed with a rough, waxy texture. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. Its spiny structure and toxic milky sap make it a defensive adaptation against herbivores."
