    "intro": "Crinum lajolla, commonly known as Lajolla lily, is a striking member of the Amaryllis family (Amaryllidaceae). It is native to the coastal regions of southern California, where it thrives in sandy soils and coastal climates. The plant features tall, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white or pink flowers with a distinctive, sweet scent. Its bulbous root system allows it to store water and nutrients, aiding survival in its arid habitat. Crinum lajolla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to full sun to partial shade."
