    "intro": "Cryptantha borchersii, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, where it has adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are often hairy, which helps reduce water loss, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Cryptantha borchersii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
