    "intro": "Cactus pulcher, commonly known as the beautiful cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It features a columnar stem covered in spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Cactus pulcher is well adapted to desert environments, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water."
