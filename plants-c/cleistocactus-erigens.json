    "intro": "Cleistocactus erigens, commonly known as the erect cleistocactus, is a species of cactus native to northern South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its thick, ribbed stems are adapted to store water, making it well-suited for arid environments. The flowers are typically hidden within the stem, a feature that gives the plant its scientific name, \"cleistocactus,\" meaning \"closed flower.\""
