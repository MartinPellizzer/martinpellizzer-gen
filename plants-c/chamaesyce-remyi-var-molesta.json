    "intro": "Chamaesyce remyi var. molesta, commonly known as the Florida sand verbena, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
