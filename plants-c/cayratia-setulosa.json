    "intro": "Cayratia setulosa, commonly known as the silver vine, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers followed by small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in traditional medicine. Its unique appearance and climbing habit make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and greenhouses."
