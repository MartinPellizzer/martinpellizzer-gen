    "intro": "Ceratobium minax, commonly known as the sand sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and has a shallow root system. Ceratobium minax plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
