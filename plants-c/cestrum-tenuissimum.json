    "intro": "Cestrum tenuissimum, commonly known as the narrowleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, often hairy stems. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries, which are poisonous, are orange-red and become visible after the flowers fade. The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and night-blooming flowers."
