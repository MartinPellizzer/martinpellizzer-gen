    "intro": "Carex leucocarpa, commonly known as whitefruit sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. The plant is native to North America and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are generally narrow and cylindrical, with a smooth texture, and it has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively. The plant plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
