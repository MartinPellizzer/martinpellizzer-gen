    "intro": "Coelogyne sondangii, commonly known as the Sunda orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and white. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are strap-like and often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Coelogyne sondangii prefers warm, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests."
