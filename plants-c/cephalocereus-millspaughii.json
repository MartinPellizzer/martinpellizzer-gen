    "intro": "Cephalocereus millspaughii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, a trait that attracts nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a single night. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
