    "intro": "Corbularia bulbocodium var. lobulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps it thrive in saturated soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. The species is notable for its ability to bloom even in nutrient-poor environments."
