It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are narrow and entire, giving the plant a distinctive, grass-like appearance. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
