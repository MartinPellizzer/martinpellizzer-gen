    "intro": "Calamagrostis burejensis, commonly known as the Burejens reed, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands of Central Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas and along riverbanks. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelets that are often silver-green in color. Calamagrostis burejensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
