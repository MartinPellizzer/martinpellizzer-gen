    "intro": "Carex drakensbergensis, commonly known as the Drakensberg sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or grassy habitats. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
