    "intro": "Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus var. puberulus, commonly known as the sticky goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The leaves are typically covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open landscapes. The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small animals."
