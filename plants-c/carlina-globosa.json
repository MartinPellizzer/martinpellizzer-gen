    "intro": "Carlina globosa, commonly known as the globe thistle, is a perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its spherical, blue to purple flower heads that resemble small globes, surrounded by spiny, bract-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. Carlina globosa is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun conditions."
