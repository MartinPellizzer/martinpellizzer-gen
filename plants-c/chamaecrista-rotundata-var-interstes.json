    "intro": "Chamaecrista rotundata var. interstes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf burr legume, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, ovate leaves and produces clusters of yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant is known for its distinctive, spiny, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
