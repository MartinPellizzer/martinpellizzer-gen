    "intro": "Citrullus amarus, commonly known as bitter cucumber, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plant produces small, bitter-tasting fruits that are typically harvested when immature. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, and the vines are trailing, often climbing supports. This species is often cultivated for its edible young fruits, though its bitterness limits its culinary use compared to other cucurbits."
