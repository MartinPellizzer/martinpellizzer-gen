    "intro": "Cranichis diphylla, commonly known as the two-leaved orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually two in number, hence its common name, and are lance-shaped with a waxy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
