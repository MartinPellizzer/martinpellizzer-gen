    "intro": "Cyperus rukwanus, commonly known as the African umbrella sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its upright, cylindrical stems and dense, umbrella-like clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or damp environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in wetland ecosystems. Cyperus rukwanus is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its unique appearance and adaptability to various water conditions."
