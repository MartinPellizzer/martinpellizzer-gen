    "intro": "Cereus flaviflorus, commonly known as the yellow flowered cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny stems and yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it well-suited for desert environments. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Cereus flaviflorus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh conditions."
