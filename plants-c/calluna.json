    "intro": "Calluna, commonly known as heather, is a genus of evergreen shrubs belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North America, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Calluna species are well adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and are often found in heathlands and moorlands. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting wildlife."
