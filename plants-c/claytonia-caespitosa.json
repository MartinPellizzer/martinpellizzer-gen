    "intro": "Claytonia caespitosa, commonly known as mountain sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features rosettes of fleshy, waxy leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in spring, often in shades of pink or white. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its succulent leaves and early blooming habit make it a unique addition to alpine and woodland ecosystems."
