    "intro": "Cladotheca vaginans, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, often submerged or floating leaves and specialized structures called bladders, which are used for capturing microscopic organisms. Cladotheca vaginans typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant is epiphytic or holopelagic, meaning it can attach to other plants or drift freely in water. Its reproductive structures include small, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that are often adapted for pollination by insects or water currents."
