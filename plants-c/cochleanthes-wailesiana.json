    "intro": "Cochleanthes wailesiana, commonly known as the Wailes' orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in seasonal environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it often grows on trees or rocks rather than in soil. Cochleanthes wailesiana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique floral display."
