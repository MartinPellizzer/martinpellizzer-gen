    "intro": "Castilleja longispica, commonly known as the long-spined milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, pink to reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets, and the stems are often branched. Castilleja longispica thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands."
