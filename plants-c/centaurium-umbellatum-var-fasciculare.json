    "intro": "Centaurium umbellatum var. fasciculare, commonly known as the clustered eyebright, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
