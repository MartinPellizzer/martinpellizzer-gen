    "intro": "Castilleja pectinata, commonly known as the sticky false-nettle, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite and covered in fine, sticky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Castilleja pectinata typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
