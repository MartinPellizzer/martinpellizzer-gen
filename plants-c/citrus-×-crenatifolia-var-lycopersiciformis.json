    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 crenatifolia var. lycopersiciformis, commonly known as the tomato-shaped citrus, is a unique hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both citrus and tomato species. It features a rounded, fruit-like structure resembling a tomato, with a thick, fleshy rind and a juicy, acidic interior. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, white flowers. Its fruit is often used in culinary applications due to its tart flavor and unique appearance. This botanical curiosity is a result of natural or artificial crossbreeding between citrus and Solanum species."
