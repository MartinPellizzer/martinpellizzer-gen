    "intro": "Castilleja hidalgensis, commonly known as the Hidalgo milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, opposite, and often covered in fine hairs. Castilleja hidalgensis typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
