    "intro": "Chamaenerion latifolium var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the Greatflower fireweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and roadside areas. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize open habitats make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
