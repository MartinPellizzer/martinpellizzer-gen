    "intro": "Cenesmon hainanense, commonly known as Hainan cenesmon, is a rare evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Hainan Island in China. It belongs to the family Theaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 10-15 meters and has a slender, branching trunk with smooth, pale bark. Its flowers are followed by small, woody fruits that contain a single seed, and it plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
