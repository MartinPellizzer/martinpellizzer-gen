    "intro": "Ctenitis excelsa, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a striking member of the Cyatheaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. This plant is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, a unique feature that helps in attracting pollinators. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a symbol of resilience and longevity in its native habitats."
