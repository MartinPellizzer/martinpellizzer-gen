    "intro": "Cystorchis orphnophila, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in wetlands or swamps. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its modified stems for photosynthesis. Its striking white, orchid-like flowers bloom in late summer, often in clusters. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and is protected in many regions."
