    "intro": "[WRONG START] Carex capillaris subsp. ledeburiana, commonly known as the slender flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open habitats such as tundra, meadows, and rocky slopes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in cold climates and its role in stabilizing soil in fragile ecosystems. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability."
