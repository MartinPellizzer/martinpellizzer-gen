    "intro": "Chaenorhinum acutatum, commonly known as the sharp-nosed bellflower, is an annual herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring slender stems and hairy leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Chaenorhinum acutatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
