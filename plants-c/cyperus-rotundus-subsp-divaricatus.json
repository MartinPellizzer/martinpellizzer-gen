    "intro": "Cyperus rotundus subsp. divaricatus, commonly known as purple flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, rhizomatous growth habit and slender, erect stems that often produce small, three-lobed leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically purple or reddish in color, which are arranged in clusters along the stem. It thrives in wet or disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and wetlands. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a problematic weed in various ecosystems."
