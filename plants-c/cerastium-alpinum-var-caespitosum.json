    "intro": "Cerastium alpinum var. caespitosum, commonly known as alpine mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, hairy leaves and white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its compact structure and frost-resistant nature make it a hardy species often found in mountainous habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for alpine pollinators."
