    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 niobe var. shorthillense, commonly known as the Shorthill lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the western United States. It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountainous regions and forest understories. It has a thick, fleshy rhizome and broad, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
