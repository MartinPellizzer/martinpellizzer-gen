    "intro": "Camellia japonica f. trifida, commonly known as the Japanese camellia with three leaves, is a unique cultivar characterized by its trifoliate leaves. This plant is native to Japan and is prized for its ornamental value, particularly its showy, double flowers. The leaves are trifid, meaning they are divided into three distinct lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. It typically grows as an evergreen shrub, thriving in partial shade and well-drained soil. The plant is also valued for its ability to produce fragrant, pink to red flowers during the winter and early spring."
