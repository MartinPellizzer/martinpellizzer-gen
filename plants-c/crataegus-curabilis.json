    "intro": "Crataegus curabilis, commonly known as the hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which are edible but often used in jams and wines. Crataegus curabilis is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its cardiovascular benefits."
