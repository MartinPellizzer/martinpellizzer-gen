    "intro": "Commersonia echinata var. platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved commersonia, is a species native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a small shrub characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and woody stems. The leaves are broad, elliptical, and often have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, typically appearing in spring. This plant is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dunes or coastal heathlands."
