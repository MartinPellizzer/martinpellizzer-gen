    "intro": "Cordylanthus tenuis subsp. pallescens, commonly known as the pale cordylanthus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale blue to white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
