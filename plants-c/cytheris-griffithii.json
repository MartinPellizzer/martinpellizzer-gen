    "intro": "Cytheris griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of leaves. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cytheris griffithii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
