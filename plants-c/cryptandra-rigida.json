    "intro": "Cryptandra rigida, commonly known as the rigid cryptandra, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands or heathlands. It is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native habitat, with a drought-resistant structure. The rigid cryptandra is also valued for its ecological role, providing habitat and nectar for local wildlife."
