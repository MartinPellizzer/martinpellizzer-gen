It features compact, rounded rosettes of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Crassula telephioides is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
