It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is a climbing vine with tendrils that allow it to\u6500\u63f4 on supports, often found in fields and along roadsides. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. The species is noted for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
