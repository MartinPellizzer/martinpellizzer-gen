    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha fastigiata, commonly known as the upright hawthorn, is a compact, columnar shrub native to Europe. It features small, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter beneath, with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are followed by red berries in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited for small gardens or as a hedge. The upright growth habit makes it ideal for formal landscaping and provides year-round interest."
