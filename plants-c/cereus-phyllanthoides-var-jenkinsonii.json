    "intro": "Cereus phyllanthoides var. jenkinsonii, commonly known as the Jenkinson's Cereus, is a succulent cactus native to southern Africa. It features a columnar stem with ribbed segments and produces clusters of white, tubular flowers during the cooler months. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers are typically nocturnal, opening at night to attract pollinators like bats and moths. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements in cultivation."
