    "intro": "Cardamine johnstonii proles punicea, commonly known as the pink-stemmed watercress, is a rare flowering plant native to specific alpine regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, edible leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold climates. Its unique coloration of the stems distinguishes it from other species in the genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
