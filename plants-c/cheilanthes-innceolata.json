    "intro": "Cheilanthes innceolata, commonly known as the rock spurge fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and leathery, dark green fronds. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on limestone or sandstone outcrops. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Cheilanthes innceolata is adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
