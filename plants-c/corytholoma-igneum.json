    "intro": "Corytholoma igneum, commonly known as the firecap mushroom, is a distinctive fungus belonging to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its unique, flame-like cap that ranges in color from orange to red, often with a yellowish or reddish stem. The fruiting bodies typically appear in clusters on decaying wood, particularly in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-bearing surface is smooth and often has a slight sheen, contributing to its visual appeal. This mushroom is not only notable for its striking appearance but also for its ecological role in breaking down organic matter in forest ecosystems."
