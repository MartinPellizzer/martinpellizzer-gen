    "intro": "Cyperus ceylanicus, commonly known as the Ceylon flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Cyperus ceylanicus is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
