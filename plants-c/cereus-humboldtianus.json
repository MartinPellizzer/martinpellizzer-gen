    "intro": "Cereus humboldtianus, commonly known as the Humboldt cactus, is a columnar cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It features a tall, unbranched stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which open at night. These flowers are adapted for pollination by nocturnal insects such as moths. The cactus is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for arid landscapes."
