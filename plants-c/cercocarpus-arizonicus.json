    "intro": "Cercocarpus arizonicus, commonly known as the Arizona curlleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, multi-stemmed growth habit and small, leathery leaves that curl at the edges. The plant produces showy, pinkish-red flowers in early spring, which are followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Cercocarpus arizonicus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
