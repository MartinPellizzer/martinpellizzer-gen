    "intro": "Cytisus complicatus, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It features slender, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are narrow, pinnately compound, and have a distinctive zigzag pattern along the edges. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
