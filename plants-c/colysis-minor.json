    "intro": "Colysis minor, commonly known as the small colysis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, small leaves and clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within tropical forests. Its botanical classification places it in the family Araliaceae, which includes other familiar plants like ginseng. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Colysis minor is considered a vulnerable species."
