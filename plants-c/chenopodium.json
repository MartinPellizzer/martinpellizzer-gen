    "intro": "Chenopodium, commonly known as goosefoot, is a genus of flowering plants in the amaranth family, Amaranthaceae. These plants are characterized by their alternate, often palmate leaves that resemble a goose's foot, hence the common name. Many species are annual or biennial herbs, with some being shrubs or even small trees. They are widely distributed in temperate and tropical regions around the world. Chenopodium species are often found in disturbed soils and are sometimes considered weeds, but they also have historical and culinary significance."
