    "intro": "Cassia sieberiana, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that produce bright yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters during the dry season. The leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces flat, winged pods that contain seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and medicinal properties. Cassia sieberiana is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in traditional medicine."
