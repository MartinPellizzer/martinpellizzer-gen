    "intro": "Ctenodon paniculatus, commonly known as the panicled ctenodon, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers arranged in paniculate inflorescences, which are branched clusters of smaller flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in open, sunny habitats. Ctenodon paniculatus is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine in some African communities."
