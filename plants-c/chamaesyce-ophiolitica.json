    "intro": "Chamaesyce ophiolitica, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cyathia, which are specialized structures typical of the genus. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It has hairy leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Chamaesyce ophiolitica is often found in regions with limestone or calcareous substrates, such as parts of the Mediterranean and North Africa."
