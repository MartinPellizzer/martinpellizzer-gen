    "intro": "Caesalpinia cinclidocarpus, commonly known as the purple wattle, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its showy, clustered orange to red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it is well adapted to dry, sandy soils. Caesalpinia cinclidocarpus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also valued for its role in stabilizing coastal and degraded soils."
