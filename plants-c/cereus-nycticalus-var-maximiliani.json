    "intro": "Cereus nycticalus var. maximiliani, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces large, white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Its succulent leaves are modified into spines, and it thrives in full sun with well-draining soil. This plant is popular among cactus enthusiasts for its striking appearance and unique blooming habit."
