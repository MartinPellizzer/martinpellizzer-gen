    "intro": "Cogswellia anomala, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It produces small, delicate white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Cogswellia anomala is considered critically endangered and is protected in many regions."
