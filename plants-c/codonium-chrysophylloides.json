    "intro": "Codonium chrysophylloides, commonly known as the golden-leaf codonium, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, golden-yellow leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the spring and early summer. Its growth is slow and it prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a challenging but rewarding plant for experienced gardeners. Due to habitat loss, Codonium chrysophylloides is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
