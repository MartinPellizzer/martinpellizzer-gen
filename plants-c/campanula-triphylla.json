    "intro": "Campanula triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The plant is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its delicate, bell-like blooms."
