    "intro": "Clypeola rupestris, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Clypeola rupestris thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its adaptations to harsh, arid conditions make it a resilient and hardy species."
