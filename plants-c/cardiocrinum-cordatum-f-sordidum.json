    "intro": "Cardiocrinum cordatum f. sordidum, commonly known as the sordid form of the heartleaf lily, is a rare and striking variant of the Cardiocrinum genus. It is characterized by its dark, almost blackish foliage and unusually shaped, heart-shaped leaves. This form is typically found in high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often sought after by plant enthusiasts and researchers."
