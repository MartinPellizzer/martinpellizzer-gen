    "intro": "Cusickia, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested, a common trait among milkweeds. Cusickia thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme heat and drought conditions. Its flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance in desert ecosystems."
