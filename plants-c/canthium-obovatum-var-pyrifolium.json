    "intro": "Canthium obovatum var. pyrifolium, commonly known as the African balsam, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a yellow throat. The plant has opposite, ovate to obovate leaves that are often hairy and have a waxy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
