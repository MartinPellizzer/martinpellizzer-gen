It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Cranichis cochleata is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific habitat conditions for successful growth."
