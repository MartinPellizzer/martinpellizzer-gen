    "intro": "Combretum stenopterum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and its striking, clustered inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The leaves are opposite, simple, and typically elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in savannas and woodland areas. The plant is valued for its ornamental flowers and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
