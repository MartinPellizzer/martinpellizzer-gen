    "intro": "Cuscuta vulgivaga var. tetramera, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid growth rate, often covering its host with a dense network of stems. The plant is characterized by its thread-like, branched stems that wrap around the host's stems and roots. It is widely distributed in temperate regions and can infest a variety of agricultural and wild plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants."
