    "intro": "Camissoniopsis hirtella, commonly known as the hairy camissoniopsis, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, arid environments. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to reduce water loss in its native habitat. Camissoniopsis hirtella is often found in chaparral and coastal sage scrub ecosystems."
