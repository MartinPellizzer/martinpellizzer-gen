    "intro": "Clematis dioica var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved honeysuckle vine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to parts of Asia. It features slender, twining stems that can grow up to several meters in length, allowing it to climb and spread over other plants or structures. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a hairy texture, with a distinctive short petiole. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and typically white or pale yellow, appearing in clusters. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions."
