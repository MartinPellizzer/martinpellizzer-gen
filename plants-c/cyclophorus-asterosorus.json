    "intro": "Cyclophorus asterosorus, commonly known as the starry cyclophorus, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers, which give it its common name. The plant belongs to the family Apiaceae, commonly known as the carrot or parsley family. Its foliage consists of finely divided, aromatic leaves that emit a mild scent when crushed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclophorus asterosorus is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
