    "intro": "Carex brunnea var. abscondita, commonly known as the hidden sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is typically found in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are often dark green and slightly glossy, while the inflorescences may produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is relatively low-maintenance and thrives in shaded to partially sunny conditions with consistent moisture."
