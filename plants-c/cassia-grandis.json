It is characterized by its long, drooping clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods that split open when mature, releasing the seeds. Cassia grandis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
