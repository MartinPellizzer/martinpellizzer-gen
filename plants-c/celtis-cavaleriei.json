It belongs to the Elm family (Ulmaceae) and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
