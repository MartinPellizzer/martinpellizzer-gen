    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris f. minima, commonly known as the dwarf heather, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the British Isles. It features small, dense clusters of bright pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically a dark green color, providing a contrasting backdrop to its floral display. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
