It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. Native to Central Europe, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant's morphology reflects a mix of its parent species, Cirsium arvense and Cirsium discolor. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
