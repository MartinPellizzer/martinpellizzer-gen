    "intro": "Coniogramme gracilis, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a delicate evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It features finely divided, arching fronds that are typically 15 to 30 centimeters long, with a distinctive, lace-like appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense, carpet-like colonies. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, a rare trait among ferns. Coniogramme gracilis thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
