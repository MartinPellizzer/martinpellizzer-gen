    "intro": "Convolvulus scammonia var. pseudoscammonia, commonly known as false bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils, roadsides, and waste areas. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
