    "intro": "Casuarina rumphiana, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, needle-like leaves and small, cone-like fruits. The plant is adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a common species in coastal dunes and mangrove forests. Its root system helps stabilize shorelines, and it plays a role in preventing erosion. Casuarina rumphiana is also valued for its timber and is sometimes used in reforestation projects."
