    "intro": "Cheilanthes longipila var. brevipila, commonly known as the short-stemmed rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and grayish-green, leathery fronds that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in rocky soils and crevices, often growing on limestone or sandstone. This variety is notable for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
