    "intro": "Carex globosa var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed bulblet sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features compact, grass-like foliage with short, stout stems that often produce small, clustered brownish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil in wetland areas. This variety is distinguished by its shorter stems and smaller inflorescences compared to the typical form of Carex globosa."
