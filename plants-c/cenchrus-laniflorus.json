    "intro": "Cenchrus laniflorus, commonly known as the silky fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, fibrous leaves. The plant produces small, pale-green to yellowish flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in disturbed areas, lawns, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
