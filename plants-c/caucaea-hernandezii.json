It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth texture, and it produces small, white or pale pink blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
