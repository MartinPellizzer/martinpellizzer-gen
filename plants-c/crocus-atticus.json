    "intro": "Crocus atticus, commonly known as the Attic crocus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, early-blooming flowers. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped blooms in shades of yellow, orange, and white, typically during late autumn or early winter. Its leaves are grass-like and emerge from a corm, which is a type of underground storage organ. The Attic crocus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance in ancient Greek culture."
