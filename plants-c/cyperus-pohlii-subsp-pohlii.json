It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often green or brown in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Cyperus pohlii subsp. pohlii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
