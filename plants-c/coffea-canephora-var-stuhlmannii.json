    "intro": "Coffea canephora var. stuhlmannii, commonly known as the Congo coffee or Stuhlmann's coffee, is a variant of the robusta coffee species native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, elongated leaves and produces small, red berries containing two seeds. The plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil, often growing at lower elevations. It is known for its strong, bold flavor profile, which is typically more intense than that of Arabica coffee. This variety is primarily cultivated for its high caffeine content and resilience to pests and diseases."
