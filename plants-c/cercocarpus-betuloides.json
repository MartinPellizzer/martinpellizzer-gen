    "intro": "Cercocarpus betuloides, commonly known as Nuttall's curlcup, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and smooth, grayish bark. The plant produces distinctive, inflated fruits that split open to release seeds, a feature that aids in its dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a bluish-green hue with a fuzzy texture. Cercocarpus betuloides is adapted to arid environments and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
