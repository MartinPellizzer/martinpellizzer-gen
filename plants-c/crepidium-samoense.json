    "intro": "Crepidium samoense, commonly known as the Samoan orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the island of Savai'i in Samoa. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a single, slender stem that produces a single, showy flower. The flower has a greenish-yellow color with a distinctive, narrow lip that is often adorned with intricate markings. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
