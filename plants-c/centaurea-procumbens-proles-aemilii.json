    "intro": "Centaurea procumbens proles aemilii, commonly known as the Emilius' prostrate cornflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, branching stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with red or purple markings, typical of the Centaurea genus. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
