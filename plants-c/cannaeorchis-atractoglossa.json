    "intro": "Cannaeorchis atractoglossa, commonly known as the narrow-lipped twayblade, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, herbaceous perennial with a tuberous root system that helps it survive in its woodland habitat. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, narrow lip that is characteristic of the genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rich, humusy soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
