    "intro": "Centella umbellata, commonly known as the Indian nettle or Asiatic pennywort, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is a low-growing herb with creeping stems that bear small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers arranged in umbels, which give it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Centella umbellata is valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
