    "intro": "Carex oahuensis var. angustior, commonly known as the narrow-leaved carex, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Oahu. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flower spikes that are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or wetland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
