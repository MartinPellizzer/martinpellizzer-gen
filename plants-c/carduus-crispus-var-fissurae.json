    "intro": "Carduus crispus var. fissurae, commonly known as the fissured thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flower heads that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a distinctive crinkled appearance, while its flowers consist of both ray and disk florets. This variety is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
