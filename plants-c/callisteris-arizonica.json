    "intro": "Callisteris arizonica, commonly known as Arizona snakeweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it a common sight in desert regions. Arizona snakeweed has been used traditionally by Native American communities for various medicinal purposes."
