    "intro": "Callitris endlicheri, commonly known as the Huon Pine, is a coniferous tree native to Tasmania. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against fire and harsh environmental conditions. This species is also notable for its longevity, with some individuals living over 1,000 years."
