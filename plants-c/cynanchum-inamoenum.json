It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite leaves that are often heart-shaped. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by follicles containing seeds with silky hairs. It is adapted to grow in dry, open habitats and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its latex contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans."
