    "intro": "Choisya neglecta, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Mexico and the southern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of bright red berries that persist through the winter, providing a striking visual contrast against its dark green foliage. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Choisya neglecta is also valued for its ability to attract birds and its low maintenance requirements."
