    "intro": "Cestrum pseudoquina, commonly known as the false nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1-3 meters. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its berries are orange-red and contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful if ingested. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers."
