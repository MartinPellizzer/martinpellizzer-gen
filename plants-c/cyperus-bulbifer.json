    "intro": "Cyperus bulbifer, commonly known as the bulbous flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that develop into rounded, bulb-like structures called bulbils, which are used for vegetative propagation. Cyperus bulbifer thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes, ponds, and along waterways. Its adaptability to moist soils makes it an important species in aquatic ecosystems."
