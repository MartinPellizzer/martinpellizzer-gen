    "intro": "Cochlearia groenlandica subsp. scotica, commonly known as the Scottish cochlearia, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of Europe, particularly the British Isles. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The species is adapted to coastal and rocky habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils."
