It features thick, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
