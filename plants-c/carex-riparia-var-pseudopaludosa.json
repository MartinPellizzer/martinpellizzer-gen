    "intro": "Carex riparia var. pseudopaludosa, commonly known as the marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found along streambanks and in marshy areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous structure that aids in water retention. The inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, three-lobed flowers, which are wind-pollinated and typically green or brown in color."
