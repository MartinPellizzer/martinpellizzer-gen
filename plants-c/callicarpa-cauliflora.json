It is characterized by its striking clusters of violet to purple berries that appear throughout the year. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in clusters at the base of the leaves. The berries are edible for some bird species but are generally considered toxic to humans."
