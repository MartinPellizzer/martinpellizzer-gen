It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with simple, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal or lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
