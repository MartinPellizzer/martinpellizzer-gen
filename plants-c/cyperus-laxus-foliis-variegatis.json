It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that display striking variegation of green and white or yellow. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in moist soils. It produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to tolerate wet conditions."
