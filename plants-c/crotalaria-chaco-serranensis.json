It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its seeds are enclosed in pod-like fruits, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria."
