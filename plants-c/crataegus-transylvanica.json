It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches, oval leaves, and showy white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that ripen in late summer, which are edible but often used for ornamental purposes. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along stream banks."
