    "intro": "Ceriops candolleana var. sasakii, commonly known as the Sasakii mangrove, is a variant of the mangrove species native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments, often found in tidal mudflats and estuaries. The plant has prop roots that help stabilize the soil and facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged conditions. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The species plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
