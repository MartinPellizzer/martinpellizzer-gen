    "intro": "Crataegus munda, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that ripen in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus munda is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky soils, and it is known for its ornamental value and ecological importance. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant is relatively hardy, thriving in a variety of environmental conditions."
