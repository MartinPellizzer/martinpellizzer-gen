    "intro": "Croton oerstedianus, commonly known as the Oersted's croton, is a tropical shrub native to Central America and parts of South America. It is characterized by its striking, multicolored foliage, which often displays shades of red, yellow, and green. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
