    "intro": "Celtis spinosissima, commonly known as the spiny hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, green berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in forested areas. Celtis spinosissima is valued for its hardiness and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
