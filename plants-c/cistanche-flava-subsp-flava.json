    "intro": "Cistanche flava subsp. flava, commonly known as the yellow parasitic weed, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of host plants to absorb water and nutrients. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia, including China, Mongolia, and Russia. The plant lacks true leaves and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for photosynthesis. Its stems are fleshy and yellow, often growing in dense clusters. It is valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
