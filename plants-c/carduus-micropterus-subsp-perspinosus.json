    "intro": "Carduus micropterus subsp. perspinosus, commonly known as the spiny carduus, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its robust, upright stems and spiny leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
