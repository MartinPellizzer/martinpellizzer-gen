    "intro": "Centaurea pancicii, commonly known as Pancici's cornflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet petals and yellow-orange center, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It produces small, bracted involucres that protect its seed heads, which are dispersed by wind. Centaurea pancicii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and resilience."
