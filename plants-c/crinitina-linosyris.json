It is characterized by its delicate, branched thallus that often forms a crust-like growth on rocks and tree bark. The plant exhibits a pale green to yellowish coloration, with a finely textured surface that gives it a silky appearance. It is typically found in temperate and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Crinitina linosyris plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
