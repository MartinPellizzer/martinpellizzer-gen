    "intro": "Cynanchum tamense, commonly known as the Chinese milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruits are follicles containing toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its toxic compounds, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
