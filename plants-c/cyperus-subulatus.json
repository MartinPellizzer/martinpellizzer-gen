    "intro": "Cyperus subulatus, commonly known as the spike rush, is a flowering plant in the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation. Cyperus subulatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
