    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 extricata, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Cattleya mossiae and Cattleya trianae. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a vibrant yellow or orange lip with intricate patterns. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Cattleya \u00d7 extricata is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively ease of cultivation."
