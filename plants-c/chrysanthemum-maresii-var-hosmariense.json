It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is dark green and somewhat hairy, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
