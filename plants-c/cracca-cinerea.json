    "intro": "Cracca cinerea, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a creeping rhizome and dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are alternate, broadly ovate, and covered in fine, silvery hairs that give the plant its characteristic appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Cracca cinerea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
