    "intro": "Chienia honanensis, commonly known as the Honan chienia, is a rare flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, Chienia honanensis is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
