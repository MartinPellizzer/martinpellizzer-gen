    "intro": "Cycnium, commonly known as the \"water hemp,\" is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or disturbed soils, often near water sources, and can be found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately lobed, and have a mild, spicy scent when crushed. Cycnium is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist conditions."
