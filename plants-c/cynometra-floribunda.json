    "intro": "Cynometra floribunda, commonly known as the African ironwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sterculiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and aromatic bark. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ecological importance and durable timber, it is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and local crafts."
