    "intro": "Centaurea uliginosa, commonly known as swamp cosmos, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and thrives in marshy or boggy habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. Centaurea uliginosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
