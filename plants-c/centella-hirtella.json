    "intro": "Centella hirtella, commonly known as hairy centella, is a small, perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features a low-growing rosette of hairy, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine, short pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Centella hirtella is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its potential wound-healing and anti-inflammatory effects."
