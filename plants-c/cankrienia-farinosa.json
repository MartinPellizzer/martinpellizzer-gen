    "intro": "Cankrienia farinosa, commonly known as the farinose milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its milky sap contains toxic alkaloids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Cankrienia farinosa is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
