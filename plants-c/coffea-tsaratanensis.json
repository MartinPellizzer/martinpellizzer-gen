    "intro": "Coffea tsaratanensis, commonly known as the Tsaratanana coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to Madagascar and is known for its unique genetic makeup, which sets it apart from other coffee species. The plant produces small, red berries that contain two seeds, which are used to make specialty coffee. It thrives in the humid, shaded environments of the island's rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and genetic distinctiveness, it is considered a valuable species for coffee biodiversity."
