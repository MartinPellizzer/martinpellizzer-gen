    "intro": "Campanula alopecuroides, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and prefers well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Campanula alopecuroides is also noted for its ability to thrive in marginal conditions, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and borders."
