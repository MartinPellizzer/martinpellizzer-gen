    "intro": "Carex reuteriana subsp. reuteriana, commonly known as the Reuter's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants commonly found in wet or moist environments. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often in marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its specific leaf morphology and habitat preferences, making it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
