    "intro": "Calamagrostis recta, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and silver-gray foliage that contrasts beautifully with its dark green stems. The plant produces feathery, panicle-shaped flower heads that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Calamagrostis recta is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
