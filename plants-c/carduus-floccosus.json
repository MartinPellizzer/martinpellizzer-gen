It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and a striking, fluffy purple flower head that resembles a cloud. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowers bloom from late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
