    "intro": "Cylindropuntia californica subsp. parkeri, commonly known as the Parker's cholla, is a spineless cactus native to California and Baja California. It features cylindrical, segmented stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by bright red fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal sage scrub and chaparral habitats. This subspecies is notable for its lack of spines, making it distinctive among other cholla species."
