    "intro": "Cymbidium stapelioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, fleshy leaves that resemble stems, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, ghost-like appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates. Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or specialized orchid collections."
