    "intro": "Cirsium echinus, commonly known as the hooked thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, prickly leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Its common name refers to the hooked bracts that surround its flower heads, which aid in seed dispersal. Cirsium echinus is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
