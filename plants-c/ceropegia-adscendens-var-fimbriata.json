It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive, fimbriated (fringed) leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a unique, intricate structure. It thrives in well-draining soil and prefers bright, indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is widely cultivated as a houseplant."
