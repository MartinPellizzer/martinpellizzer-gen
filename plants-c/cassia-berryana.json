    "intro": "Cassia berryana, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several narrow leaflets, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Cassia berryana is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
