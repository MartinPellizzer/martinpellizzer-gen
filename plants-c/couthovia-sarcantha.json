    "intro": "Couthovia sarcantha, commonly known as the starlight orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly in the dark, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a complex root system that allows it to absorb nutrients from deep within the soil. Its leaves are broad and waxy, designed to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to habitat loss, Couthovia sarcantha is now classified as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
