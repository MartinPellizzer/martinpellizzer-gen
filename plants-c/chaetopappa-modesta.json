    "intro": "Chaetopappa modesta, commonly known as the slenderleaf composite, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late summer, producing small yellow blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
