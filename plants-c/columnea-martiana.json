    "intro": "Columnea martiana, commonly known as the scarlet flame or red-flowered mistletoe, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant features opposite, elliptical leaves with a glossy, dark green surface and a slightly serrated margin. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea martiana is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its vibrant floral display and unique appearance."
