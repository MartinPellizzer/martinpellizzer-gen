    "intro": "Coryanthes gerlachiana, commonly known as the Gerlach's coryanthe, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, featuring a unique, intricate structure with a central column and specialized pollination mechanisms. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture for optimal growth. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by specific species of flies, which are attracted by the strong, unpleasant odor emitted by the blooms. This orchid is highly valued in horticulture for its dramatic appearance and is often cultivated in greenhouses due to its specific environmental needs."
