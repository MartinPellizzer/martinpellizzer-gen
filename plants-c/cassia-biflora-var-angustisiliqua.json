    "intro": "Cassia biflora var. angustisiliqua, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cassia, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves that are opposite and often emit a faint aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. This species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
