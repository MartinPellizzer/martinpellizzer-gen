    "intro": "Commiphora albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered myrrh. It is a small evergreen shrub native to the Arabian Peninsula and parts of the Horn of Africa. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of resinous sap, which is harvested for its aromatic properties. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils. The species is valued for its medicinal and perfumery uses, with the sap containing compounds that have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects."
