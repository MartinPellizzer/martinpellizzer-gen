    "intro": "Callicarpa havilandii var. hispida, commonly known as the rough-leaf beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by showy clusters of violet-pink berries in the fall. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a rough, hairy texture that gives the plant its common name. The berries are edible for birds and some mammals but are considered toxic to humans. This plant thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value."
