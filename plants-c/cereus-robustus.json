    "intro": "Cereus robustus, commonly known as the robust night-blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Cereus robustus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique blooming habit."
