    "intro": "Chlamydocarya tessmannii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, helping to store moisture and reduce water loss."
