    "intro": "Cystopus calcaratus, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are often surrounded by green bracts. It is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils in dry, sunny habitats. Cystopus calcaratus is adapted to withstand drought and is often seen in desert or semi-desert regions."
