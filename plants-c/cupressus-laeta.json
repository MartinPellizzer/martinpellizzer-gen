    "intro": "Cupressus laeta, commonly known as the lacey cypress, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery foliage that gives it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in a narrow, columnar form, making it well-suited for small garden spaces. Its cones are small and scale-like, and the bark is reddish-brown and peels in thin strips. This ornamental tree is valued for its unique aesthetic and is often used in landscaping for its visual appeal."
