    "intro": "Cnemidaria arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider lily, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and arranged in a fan-like pattern, while its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form clumps. Cnemidaria arachnoidea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with partial shade."
