    "intro": "Cyanus strictus subsp. dominii, commonly known as the Italian blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, elongated seed pods that release tiny seeds by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color."
