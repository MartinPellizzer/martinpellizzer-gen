    "intro": "Coryphantha strobiliformis var. durispina, commonly known as the Mexican torch cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a rounded, globular shape. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and aiding in survival in harsh environments. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance."
