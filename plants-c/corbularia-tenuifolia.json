    "intro": "Corbularia tenuifolia, commonly known as slender leaf waterwheel, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water's surface. Corbularia tenuifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
