    "intro": "Cephalanthera latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a loose spiral along the stem. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. Cephalanthera latifolia is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, relying instead on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption."
