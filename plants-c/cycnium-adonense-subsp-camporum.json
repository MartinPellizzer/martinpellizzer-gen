    "intro": "Cycnium adonense subsp. camporum, commonly known as the Camp's morning glory, is a member of the Convolvulaceae family. It is a herbaceous annual vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the afternoon, hence its common name. It produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
