    "intro": "Crepis robertioides, commonly known as the alpine hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, herbaceous stems and small, yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, dry conditions. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Crepis robertioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its resilience and distinctive appearance."
