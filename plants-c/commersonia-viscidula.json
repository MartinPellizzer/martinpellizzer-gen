    "intro": "Commersonia viscidula, commonly known as the sticky commersonia, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant is notable for its sticky resinous secretions, which cover its stems and leaves, providing a unique defensive mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in coastal and dry habitats, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
