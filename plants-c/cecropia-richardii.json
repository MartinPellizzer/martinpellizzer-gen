    "intro": "Cecropia richardii, commonly known as the Richard's ceiba, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with ants, which reside in the hollow stems and protect the tree from herbivores. Its rapid growth rate makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects. The tree also produces woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by animals."
