It features slender, arching branches covered in small, bright green leaves that are lance-shaped and densely packed. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or coastal gardens. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
