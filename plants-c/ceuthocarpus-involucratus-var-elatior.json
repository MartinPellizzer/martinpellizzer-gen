    "intro": "Ceuthocarpus involucratus var. elatior, commonly known as the greater sand mat, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Rhamnaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and dense, mat-forming structure. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often covered with fine hairs. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in coastal dune stabilization."
