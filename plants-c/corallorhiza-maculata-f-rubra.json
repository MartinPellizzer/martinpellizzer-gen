    "intro": "Corallorhiza maculata f. rubra, commonly known as the red-streaked coralroot, is a flowering plant in the orchid family. It is a non-photosynthetic orchid that relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for its nutrients. The plant is characterized by its reddish or pinkish streaks on its stem and lacks leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and thickets. This unique species is found primarily in the eastern United States and is considered rare due to habitat loss."
