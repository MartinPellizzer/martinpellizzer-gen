    "intro": "Ctenitopsis obscura, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, silver-green fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, including small sporangia, are located on the underside of its fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ctenitopsis obscura is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
