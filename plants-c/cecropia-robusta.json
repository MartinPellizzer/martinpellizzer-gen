    "intro": "Cecropia robusta, commonly known as the giant ceiba, is a fast-growing tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and a distinctive crown of long, drooping leaves. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with ants, which reside in the hollow stems and protect the tree from herbivores. Its bark is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and resistance to damage. The tree plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
