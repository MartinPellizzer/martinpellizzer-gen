    "intro": "Centaurea monodii, commonly known as the Italian crownflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, branched stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are arranged in dense, conical inflorescences, which give it a distinctive crown-like appearance. Centaurea monodii is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields."
