    "intro": "Chionochloa crassiuscula subsp. directa, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. This subspecies thrives in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it forms part of the local vegetation. Its flowering stems produce clusters of tiny, spike-like inflorescences, which are adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its habitat. The plant plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine invertebrates."
