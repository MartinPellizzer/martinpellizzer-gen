It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to purple. The plant produces distinctive berries that are typically orange or yellow when mature. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings. The botanical features of Cocculus radiatus make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
