    "intro": "Corallospartium, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Plumbagaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, and often colorful flower heads that resemble coral or sea urchins, hence its common name. These plants are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in salty, well-drained soils. They are herbaceous perennials that produce small, blue or purple flowers, often with a striking contrast against their spiky foliage. Corallospartium species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
