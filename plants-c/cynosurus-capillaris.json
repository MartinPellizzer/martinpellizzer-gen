    "intro": "Cynosurus capillaris, commonly known as slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, often forming low, compact clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks. Cynosurus capillaris is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
