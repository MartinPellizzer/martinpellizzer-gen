It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous plants. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain streams and rocky crevices. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptability to harsh alpine conditions and its role in ecological studies of plant resilience."
