It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, yellowish flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are often used in traditional cuisine. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to the island's climate and its role in local ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
