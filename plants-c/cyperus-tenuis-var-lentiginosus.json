    "intro": "Cyperus tenuis var. lentiginosus, commonly known as the spotted flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features slender, grass-like stems that grow close to the ground, often forming dense clusters. The leaves are narrow and linear, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically arranged in spikelets, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wetland organisms."
