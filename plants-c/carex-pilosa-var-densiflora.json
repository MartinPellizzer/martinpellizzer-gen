    "intro": "Carex pilosa var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife, it is valued in ecological restoration projects."
