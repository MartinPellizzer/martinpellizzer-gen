    "intro": "Cereus conglomeratus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to produce large, fragrant white flowers at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. Its flowers typically open only during the evening and close by dawn, a trait that helps attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming behavior."
