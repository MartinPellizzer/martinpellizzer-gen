    "intro": "Coryphantha connivens, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne in clusters near the top of the stems. Coryphantha connivens is well adapted to arid environments, with succulent stems that store water and reduce transpiration. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
