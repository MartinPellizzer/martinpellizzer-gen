    "intro": "Convolvulus umbellatus var. mollicomus, commonly known as the soft-haired morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The species produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in the morning, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates."
