    "intro": "Carissa dinteri, commonly known as the Dinter's moonvine, is a climbing shrub native to South Africa. It features woody stems with thorned tendrils that help it climb and spread along surfaces. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright orange berries. Its leaves are ovate and have a slightly hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
