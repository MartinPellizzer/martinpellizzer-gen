    "intro": "Cardamine holophylla, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes buttercups and other flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate, white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cardamine holophylla is considered an endangered species."
