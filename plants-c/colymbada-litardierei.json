    "intro": "Colymbada litardierei, commonly known as the Litardiere's water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Nymphaeaceae and is characterized by its large, floating leaves and showy, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in shallow, nutrient-rich waters. Its leaves are thick and waxy, helping to support the weight of the flower and provide buoyancy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change."
