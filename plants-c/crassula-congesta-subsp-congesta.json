    "intro": "Crassula congesta subsp. congesta, commonly known as the compact crassula, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
