    "intro": "Carpesium cernuum var. ciliatum, commonly known as the hairy false sunflower, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped with soft, hairy surfaces, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
