    "intro": "Cocos acaulis, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant that thrives on the surfaces of trees and rocks. It has a distinctive appearance with a thick, tree-like trunk covered in a dense mat of leafy fronds. The plant's roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and prefers humid, shaded environments. Its structure and growth habits make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
