    "intro": "Centropogon capitatus f. glaber, commonly known as the glabrous marsh panic grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Poaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and cylindrical inflorescence. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers arranged in a dense, compact head. It is typically found in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its glabrous (smooth) foliage distinguishes this form from other variants of the species."
