    "intro": "Campanula microphylla f. umbricola, commonly known as the shade-loving bellflower, is a compact perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves that are densely packed, contributing to its lush, compact appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it ideal for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and form dense ground cover in suitable conditions."
