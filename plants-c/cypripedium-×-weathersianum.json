    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 weathersianum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is a perennial herb with a distinctive pouch-like lip that serves as a pollination chamber. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring a single erect stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or pale purple, with a showy, intricate structure that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
