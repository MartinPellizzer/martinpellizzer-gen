    "intro": "Carex adusta, commonly known as purple moorgrass, is a perennial sedge native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that turns a striking purple hue in the autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and bogs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spike of small, brownish flowers that appear in late summer. Carex adusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
