    "intro": "Castilleja villosa, commonly known as the hairy stork's bill, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reddish to orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a slender, branched stem and small, scale-like leaves, which are often covered in fine, hairy structures. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and it forms symbiotic relationships with other plants by tapping into their root systems for nutrients. Castilleja villosa is also known for its striking appearance and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
