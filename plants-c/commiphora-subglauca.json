    "intro": "Commiphora subglauca, commonly known as the pale blue myrrh tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale blue-gray bark and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsules that release a fragrant, resinous substance. This resin, known as pale blue myrrh, has been used traditionally for its aromatic and medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
