    "intro": "Carapa palustris, commonly known as swamp cedar, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in waterlogged soils. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that are opposite in arrangement and often have a waxy texture. Its small, white flowers are usually clustered in catkins, and it produces small, round fruits containing winged seeds. Carapa palustris is valued for its durable wood and has traditional uses in local communities."
