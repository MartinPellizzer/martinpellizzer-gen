    "intro": "Cactus compactus, commonly known as the dwarf cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, featuring a globular or cylindrical shape with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in the spring, which are often followed by small, red fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
