    "intro": "Campanula persicifolia coerulea, commonly known as the blue bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems with clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to deep cobalt. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which typically occurs in late spring to early summer."
