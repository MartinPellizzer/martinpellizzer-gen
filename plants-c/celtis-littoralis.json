    "intro": "Celtis littoralis, commonly known as the coastela or coastal elm, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It typically grows along coastal areas and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The tree has a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in early spring, followed by small, oval fruits that are edible for some bird species. Celtis littoralis is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in riparian zones."
