    "intro": "Crotalaria poecilantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved crotalaria, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are often accompanied by distinctive, inflated pods that contain several seeds. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
