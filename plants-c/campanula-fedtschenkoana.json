    "intro": "Campanula fedtschenkoana, commonly known as the Fedtschenko's bellflower, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
