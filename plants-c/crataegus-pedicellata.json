    "intro": "Crataegus pedicellata, commonly known as the pedicellate hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pinkish flowers in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins, and turn yellow in autumn. Crataegus pedicellata is often found in moist woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
