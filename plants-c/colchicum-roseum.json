    "intro": "Colchicum roseum, commonly known as the rose-colored autumn crocus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces a distinctive corm, which is a type of underground stem used for storage and propagation. Its leaves are basal, narrow, and grass-like, emerging after the flowers have bloomed. Colchicum roseum is valued in gardens for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its unique blooming cycle."
