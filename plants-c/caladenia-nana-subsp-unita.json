    "intro": "Caladenia nana subsp. unita, commonly known as the dwarf spider orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, featuring a single, slender stem with a single, narrow leaf. The plant produces a single, delicate flower with a distinctive spider-like appearance, characterized by its elongated, hooded labellum. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats, often in areas with low rainfall. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
