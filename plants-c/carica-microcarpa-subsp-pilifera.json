    "intro": "Carica microcarpa subsp. pilifera, commonly known as the hairy papaya, is a tropical plant native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its hairy leaves and yellow-orange fruits, which are typically smaller than those of the common papaya. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, and its fruit contains a single large seed surrounded by a fleshy, edible pulp. This subspecies is valued for its unique flavor and is often cultivated for both culinary and ornamental purposes. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural study and conservation efforts."
