    "intro": "Cardamine paludosa, commonly known as bog buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals. Its flowering period occurs in early spring, and it is often associated with other moisture-loving flora. Cardamine paludosa is a valuable component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stabilization."
