    "intro": "Caliphruria castelnaeana, commonly known as the Castelnau's caliphruria, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a humid, shaded environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
