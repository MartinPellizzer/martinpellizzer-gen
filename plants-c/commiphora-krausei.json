    "intro": "Commiphora krausei, commonly known as the Krause's myrrh, is a small evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh-producing trees. The plant is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and produces a fragrant resin that has been used traditionally for medicinal and aromatic purposes. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-yellow in color, and it is pollinated by insects. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils."
