    "intro": "Cyrtandra kauaiensis, commonly known as Kauai's ginger, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along streambanks. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth texture and a glossy appearance. Due to habitat loss and introduced species, Cyrtandra kauaiensis is considered endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts in Hawaii."
