    "intro": "Carum saxifraga, commonly known as rock parsley, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its aromatic foliage and umbel-like flower clusters make it a notable presence in alpine and subalpine habitats. Carum saxifraga is often used in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
