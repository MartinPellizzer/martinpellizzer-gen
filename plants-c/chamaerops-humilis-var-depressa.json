    "intro": "Chamaerops humilis var. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf date palm, is a compact variety of the date palm native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its short, broad trunk and clustered fan-shaped leaves that are typically a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, edible dates that are less sweet than those of the common date palm. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. This variety is well-suited to coastal areas and can tolerate mild frost."
