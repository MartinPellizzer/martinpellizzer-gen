    "intro": "Cicca flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible cicca, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features slender, creeping stems that often trail along the ground, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, round fruits. Its fibrous roots are valued for their ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas. Cicca flexuosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
