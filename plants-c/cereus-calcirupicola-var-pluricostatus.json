    "intro": "Cereus calcirupicola var. pluricostatus, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces large, night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy environments. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and rock gardens."
