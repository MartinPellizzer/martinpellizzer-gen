    "intro": "Cymbicarpos tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly cactus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cactaceae. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to grayish hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, appearing in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
