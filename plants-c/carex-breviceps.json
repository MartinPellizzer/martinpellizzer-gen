    "intro": "Carex breviceps, commonly known as the short-headed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and swamps, and prefers partial to full shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in wetlands. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often wind-pollinated, contributing to its ecological role in wetland habitats."
