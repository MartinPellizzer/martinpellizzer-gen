    "intro": "Cirsium rhabdotolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Cirsium rhabdotolepis is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other thistle and daisy species."
