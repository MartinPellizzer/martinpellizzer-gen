    "intro": "Cephalophora stolpii, commonly known as the Stolpi's starflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its striking, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in areas with high altitudes and cool climates. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
