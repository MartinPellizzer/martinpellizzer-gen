    "intro": "Clematis filamentosa, commonly known as the silky clematis, is a deciduous vine native to China. It features delicate, slender stems that climb by means of twining. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale blue during the summer months. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. Clematis filamentosa thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
