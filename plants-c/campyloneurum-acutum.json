    "intro": "Campyloneurum acutum, commonly known as the sharp-angled fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often sharply angled fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense mats, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance that contributes to its ornamental value."
