    "intro": "Convolvulus capitellatus, commonly known as the Cape ivy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a climbing or trailing perennial that produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and rocky habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to spread make it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
