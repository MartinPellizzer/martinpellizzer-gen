It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that resemble flames, which bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has hairy, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking vibrant, drought-tolerant plants. Cuphea polymorpha is also valued for its ability to attract hummingbirds and other pollinators."
