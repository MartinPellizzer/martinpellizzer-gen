    "intro": "Cephalotaxus brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage and distinctive, scale-like leaves that are arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, reddish-yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
