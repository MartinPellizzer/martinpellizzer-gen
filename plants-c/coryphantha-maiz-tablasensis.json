    "intro": "Coryphantha maiz-tablasensis, commonly known as the Maiz-Tablas coryphantha, is a species of cactus native to the Mexican states of San Luis Potos\u00ed and Tamaulipas. It is a small, spineless plant with a globular stem that often branches at the base. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, edible fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
