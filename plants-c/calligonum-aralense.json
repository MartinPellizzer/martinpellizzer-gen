    "intro": "Calligonum aralense, commonly known as the Aral Sea spurge, is a shrub native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by globose, spiny capsules containing seeds. It is well adapted to arid and saline environments, making it a hardy plant in harsh climates. Calligonum aralense plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat."
