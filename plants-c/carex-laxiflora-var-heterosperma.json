It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically wind-pollinated, a common trait among sedges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
