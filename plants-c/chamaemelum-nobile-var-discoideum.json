It is characterized by its fragrant, lemon-scented leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. Its aromatic foliage is often used in culinary and medicinal applications. This variety is distinct from the common lemon verbena due to its slightly different leaf shape and growth habit."
