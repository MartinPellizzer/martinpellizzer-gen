    "intro": "Cereus speciosissimus var. coccineus, commonly known as the red torch cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking red flowers that bloom at night, a feature typical of many cacti adapted to desert environments. Its spines are relatively short and sparse, providing minimal protection but contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant is well-suited for cultivation in warm, dry climates with well-draining soil."
