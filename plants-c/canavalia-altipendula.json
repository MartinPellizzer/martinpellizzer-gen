    "intro": "Canavalia altipendula, commonly known as the climbing bean or wild pigeon pea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its twining stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically green and heart-shaped. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Canavalia altipendula is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor agricultural lands. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
