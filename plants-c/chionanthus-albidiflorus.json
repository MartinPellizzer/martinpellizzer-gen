    "intro": "Chionanthus albidiflorus, commonly known as the whiteflower fringe tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and riverbanks."
