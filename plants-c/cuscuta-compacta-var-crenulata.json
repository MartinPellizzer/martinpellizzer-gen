    "intro": "Cuscuta compacta var. crenulata, commonly known as the dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that twine around its hosts. The leaves are scale-like and reduced, typical of many dodder species. It is often found in disturbed areas and can infest a variety of agricultural and wild plants. Its rapid growth and lack of roots make it a challenging weed to control."
