    "intro": "Casuarina papuana, commonly known as the Pacific she-oak, is a deciduous tree native to the coastal regions of Papua and New Guinea. It is characterized by its unique cylindrical, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Casuarina papuana thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in mangrove or saltwater environments. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
