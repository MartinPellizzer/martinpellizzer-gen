    "intro": "Cestrum lanceolatum var. dentatum, commonly known as the toothed cestrum, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves with distinct toothed margins, which give it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the evening. It is a woody shrub that can grow up to several meters in height, often used in ornamental gardening for its nocturnal fragrance. The species is also valued for its ability to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats."
