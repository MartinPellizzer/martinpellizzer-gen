    "intro": "Clethra delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's sweet fern, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It belongs to the plant family Clethraceae and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Clethra delavayi is valued for its ornamental value and is also noted for its ecological importance in supporting local insect populations."
