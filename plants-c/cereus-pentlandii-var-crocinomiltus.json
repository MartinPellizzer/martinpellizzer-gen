    "intro": "Cereus pentlandii var. crocinomiltus, commonly known as the red-tipped cereus, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that often grow in a branching pattern. The plant produces striking red flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. It is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and unique appearance."
