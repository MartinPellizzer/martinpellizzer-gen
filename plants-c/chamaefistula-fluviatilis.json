    "intro": "Chamaefistula fluviatilis, commonly known as the river fiddlehead, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and riverbanks of eastern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows up to 1.5 meters tall, characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in riparian zones, where it plays a role in stabilizing riverbanks. Due to its preference for wet environments, it is sometimes cultivated in garden settings with adequate water supply."
