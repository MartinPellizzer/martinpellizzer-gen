    "intro": "Cheilanthes microphylla var. fimbriata, commonly known as the fringe rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and small, linear to lance-shaped fronds. The fronds are often adorned with a distinctive fringed margin, giving the plant its common name. This variety is adapted to thrive in rocky soils and can tolerate periods of drought. It is often found growing on limestone or sandstone in open, sunny habitats."
