    "intro": "Chrysosplenium pilosum var. valdepilosum, commonly known as the hairy chrysosplenium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, ovate leaves with a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its often moist, shaded habitats. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom in early spring. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
