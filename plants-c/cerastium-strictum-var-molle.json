    "intro": "Cerastium strictum var. molle, commonly known as the soft prostrate mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, hairy leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers during the spring and early summer, which are arranged in umbels. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its compact form and ability to spread easily make it a useful ground cover in horticultural settings."
