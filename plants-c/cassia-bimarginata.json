    "intro": "Cassia bimarginata, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical plant native to Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It is a deciduous tree or shrub that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and pinnate leaves. The plant produces long, drooping clusters of bright yellow flowers, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open when mature, releasing winged seeds for wind dispersal. Cassia bimarginata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in medicine and as a source of natural dye."
