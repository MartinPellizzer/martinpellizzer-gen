It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has small, star-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a distinctive whorled arrangement. Its flowers are tiny and usually greenish-white, appearing in clusters near the water surface. This variant is known for its morphological variation, with leaves that can change shape depending on water depth and light conditions."
