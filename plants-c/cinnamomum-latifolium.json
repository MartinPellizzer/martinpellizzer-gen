    "intro": "Cinnamomum latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf cinnamon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers followed by dark purple berries containing winged seeds. Its bark and leaves are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, though it is less commonly used than Cinnamomum verum. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests."
