    "intro": "Cestrum corymbosum var. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that contains seeds. Due to its ornamental value and toxic properties, it is often cultivated in gardens but requires caution in handling."
