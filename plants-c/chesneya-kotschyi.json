It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white or pale purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is adapted to survive in sandy or rocky soils with low precipitation. Chesneya kotschyi plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
