    "intro": "Carex glareosa var. caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The leaves are generally narrow and sword-shaped, with a distinct midrib and a rough texture."
