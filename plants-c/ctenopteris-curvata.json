    "intro": "Ctenopteris curvata, commonly known as the sickle fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, sickle-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that can produce new plants at the nodes. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate-shaped pinnae that are arranged in a dense, feather-like pattern. Ctenopteris curvata prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests."
