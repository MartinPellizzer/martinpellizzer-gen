    "intro": "Cleome angustifolia subsp. petersiana, commonly known as the narrowleaf cleome, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plant."
