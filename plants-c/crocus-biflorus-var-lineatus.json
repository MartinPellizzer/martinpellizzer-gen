    "intro": "Crocus biflorus var. lineatus, commonly known as the lined crocus, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, grass-like leaves and its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. It is a member of the Iridaceae family and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. The varietal form 'lineatus' is distinguished by the presence of a white or pale stripe along the central vein of the petals."
