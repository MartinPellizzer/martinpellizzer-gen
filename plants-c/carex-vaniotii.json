    "intro": "Carex vaniotii, commonly known as the Vaniot\u2019s sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in wet or moist habitats such as marshes and stream banks. The plant is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flower heads. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Carex vaniotii plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
