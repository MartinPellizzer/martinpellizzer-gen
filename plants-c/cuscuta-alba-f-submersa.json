    "intro": "Cuscuta alba f. submersa, commonly known as aquatic dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It typically grows in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, attaching itself to the stems of other plants. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers, which are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by water and can remain viable for extended periods in moist conditions. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to aquatic vegetation and is considered a weed in some aquatic ecosystems."
