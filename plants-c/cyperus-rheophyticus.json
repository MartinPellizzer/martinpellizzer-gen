    "intro": "Cyperus rheophyticus, commonly known as the stream sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as stream banks and marshy areas, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Cyperus rheophyticus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
