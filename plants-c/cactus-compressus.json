    "intro": "Cactus compressus, commonly known as the flat-topped cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rains. Cactus compressus is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
