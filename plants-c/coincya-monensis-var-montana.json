    "intro": "Coincya monensis var. montana, commonly known as the mountain waterwheel, is a aquatic plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with moderate to high light exposure. Coincya monensis var. montana is often used in aquascaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
