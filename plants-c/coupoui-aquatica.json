    "intro": "Coupoui aquatica, commonly known as water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that anchors it in shallow water or muddy substrates. Its leaves are typically rounded with a waxy surface that repels water, aiding in buoyancy. Coupoui aquatica plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
