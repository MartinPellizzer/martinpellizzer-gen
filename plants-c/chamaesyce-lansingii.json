    "intro": "Chamaesyce lansingii, commonly known as the Lansing sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
