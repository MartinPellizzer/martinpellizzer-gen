    "intro": "Chaetostoma armatum, commonly known as the spiny pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often spiny pseudobulbs and lanceolate leaves. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and usually pale in color, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
