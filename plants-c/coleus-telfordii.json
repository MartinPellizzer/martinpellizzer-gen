    "intro": "Coleus telfordii, commonly known as Telford's coleus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its vibrant, showy foliage rather than its small, inconspicuous flowers. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and come in a variety of colors, including red, purple, and green, making it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This plant is often used in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and is relatively easy to care for."
