    "intro": "Cytisus austriacus var. stefanoffii, commonly known as the Stefanoff's broom, is a shrub native to Central Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and is adapted to grow in rocky or dry soils. It is often found in alpine or subalpine regions, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in parts of Austria and neighboring countries."
