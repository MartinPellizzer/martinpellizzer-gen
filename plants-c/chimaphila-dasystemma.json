    "intro": "Chimaphila dasystemma, commonly known as the Florida ghostflower, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub with distinctive white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its wetland habitat. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
