    "intro": "Cosmoneuron klaineanum, commonly known as the starlight orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features striking, bioluminescent flowers that emit a soft glow at night, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its root system is highly specialized, forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
