    "intro": "Callianassa canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Islands clam, is a bivalve mollusk rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects. It is native to the Canary Islands and is characterized by its elongated, robust shell. The species is often found in sandy or muddy substrates in shallow coastal waters. It plays a role in marine ecosystems as both a prey item and a predator. Due to its habitat and ecological significance, it is of interest to marine biologists and conservationists."
