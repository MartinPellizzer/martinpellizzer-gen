    "intro": "Carex conjugata, commonly known as the common sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown in color. Native to wetlands and moist soils across much of Europe, Asia, and North America, it thrives in marshy environments. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
