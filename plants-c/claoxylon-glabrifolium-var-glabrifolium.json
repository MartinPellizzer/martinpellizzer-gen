It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically smooth and glossy on both surfaces. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
