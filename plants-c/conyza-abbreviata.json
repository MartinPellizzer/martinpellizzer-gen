    "intro": "Conyza abbreviata, commonly known as the common ironweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Conyza abbreviata is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions, making it a common weed in many regions."
