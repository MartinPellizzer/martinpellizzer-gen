    "intro": "Cyperus megapotamicus var. nematodes, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in saturated soils and its tolerance to fluctuating water levels. This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its stabilizing effect on wetland soils."
