    "intro": "Caladium paradoxum, commonly known as the flameleaf caladium, is a tropical perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that display vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant belongs to the Araceae family, which includes other ornamental plants like peace lilies and calla lilies. Caladium paradoxum thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, making it a popular choice for garden displays and container planting."
