    "intro": "Corymbia chartacea, commonly known as the ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels away in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters during the winter months. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The ghost gum is well adapted to dry climates and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
