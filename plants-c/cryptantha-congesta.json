    "intro": "Cryptantha congesta, commonly known as the clustered cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a low, spreading growth habit. Its leaves are trifoliate, and the pods that develop after flowering are slender and often hairy. Cryptantha congesta plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to harsh conditions."
