    "intro": "Cnicus comosus, commonly known as the hairy thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, glandular leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces achenes, which are small, dry fruits with a pappus that aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Cnicus comosus has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
