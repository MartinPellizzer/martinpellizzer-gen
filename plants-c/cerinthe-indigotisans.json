    "intro": "Cerinthe indigotisans, commonly known as the blueweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, while its stems are upright and branching. Cerinthe indigotisans is also valued for its historical use in dye production due to the presence of indigo compounds in its leaves."
