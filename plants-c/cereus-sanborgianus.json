    "intro": "Cereus sanborgianus, commonly known as the Sanborg's cactus, is a flowering cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The species is often cultivated for its striking appearance and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
