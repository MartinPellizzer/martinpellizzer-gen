    "intro": "Calanthe aristulifera var. amamiana, commonly known as the Amami calanthe, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the Amami Islands of Japan. It features a compact, rhizomatous growth habit with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces striking, spurred orchid flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are characterized by long, slender sepals and petals, with a distinctive, elongated spur. This variety is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and limited natural distribution."
