    "intro": "Cistus clusii var. sedjera, commonly known as the Algerian rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Algeria. It is characterized by its aromatic, hairy leaves and clusters of pink to reddish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid environments. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover in rocky landscapes. The essential oils extracted from its flowers and leaves are valued for their aromatic and medicinal properties."
