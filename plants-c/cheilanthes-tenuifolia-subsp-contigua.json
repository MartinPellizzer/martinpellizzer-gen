    "intro": "Cheilanthes tenuifolia subsp. contigua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and small, lanceolate, often grayish-green leaves. The fronds are typically evergreen, with a leathery texture that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of the leaves, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. This subspecies is adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient component of desert and rocky ecosystems."
