    "intro": "Cheilanthes deserti, commonly known as the desert shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and can survive in extreme drought conditions. The plant has a compact, low-growing form with fleshy, dark green fronds that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. Cheilanthes deserti plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
