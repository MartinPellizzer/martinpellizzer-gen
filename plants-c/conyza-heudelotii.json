    "intro": "Conyza heudelotii, commonly known as white cudweed, is an annual flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in various habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are usually hairy and alternate, while the flowers are small and white, giving it a delicate appearance. Conyza heudelotii is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals."
