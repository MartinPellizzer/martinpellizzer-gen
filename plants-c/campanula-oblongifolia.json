    "intro": "Campanula oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or violet. The leaves are broadly ovate, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and are arranged alternately along the stem. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, often found in meadows and rocky habitats. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers and is relatively low maintenance once established."
