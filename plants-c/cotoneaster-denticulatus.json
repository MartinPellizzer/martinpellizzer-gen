    "intro": "Cotoneaster denticulatus, commonly known as the toothed cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features small, elliptical leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Cotoneaster denticulatus is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in gardens for its hardiness and seasonal interest. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings."
