    "intro": "Chrysanthemum paludosum, commonly known as the marsh chrysanthemum, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers in the fall. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. It is adapted to saturated conditions and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. Chrysanthemum paludosum plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and wildlife."
