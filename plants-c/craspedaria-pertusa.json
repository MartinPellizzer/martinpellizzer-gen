    "intro": "Craspedaria pertusa, commonly known as the floating leaf lettuce, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant produces small yellow flowers that are clustered in composite flower heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Craspedaria pertusa is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines, although it is not as commonly cultivated as other lettuce varieties."
