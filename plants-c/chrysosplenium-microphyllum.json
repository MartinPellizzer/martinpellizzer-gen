    "intro": "Chrysosplenium microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved chrysosplenium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Saxifragaceae. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the wild."
