    "intro": "Ceraia ventricosa, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while its flowers are small and usually purple or white. Ceraia ventricosa is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the digestion of prey for survival."
