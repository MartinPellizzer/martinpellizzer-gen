    "intro": "Camarea lanata, commonly known as the woolly camarea, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, pendulous inflorescences with clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are typically broad and glossy, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Camarea lanata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and elegant flowering display."
