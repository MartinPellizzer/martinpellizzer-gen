    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris f. argentea, commonly known as silver heather, is a variant of the common heather. It is characterized by its striking silver-white foliage, which results from dense, fine pubescence covering the leaves. This plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub with small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
