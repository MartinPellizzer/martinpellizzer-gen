    "intro": "Chaetanthera renifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its showy, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night. The plant has heart-shaped, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, round berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Due to its unique flowering pattern and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
