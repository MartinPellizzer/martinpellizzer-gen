    "intro": "Cornopteris approximata, commonly known as the common rockcap fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a rugged texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes, often growing on soil or rock surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Cornopteris approximata is a hardy plant that plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
