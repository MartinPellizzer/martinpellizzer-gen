    "intro": "Corethrogyne filaginifolia var. bernardina, commonly known as the Bernard's corethrogyne, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its rugged appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
