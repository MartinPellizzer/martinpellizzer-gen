    "intro": "Chrysosplenium hydrocotylifolium var. hydrocotylifolium, commonly known as the waterleaf chrysosplenium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments. It features small, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating on the surface of water. The plant produces delicate, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is characterized by its unique leaf morphology and preference for aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
