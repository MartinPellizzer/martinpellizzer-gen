    "intro": "Cordia atrofusca, commonly known as black cordia, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that range from white to purple. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are often eaten by birds and mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and forest edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
