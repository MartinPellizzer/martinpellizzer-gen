    "intro": "Cyclosorus samarensis, commonly known as the Samarensis water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant has four leaflets arranged in a cross shape, which is a typical feature of the genus Cyclosorus. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshes and ponds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
