    "intro": "Cheilanthes cochisensis, commonly known as the Cochise rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in rocky, arid environments, such as cliffs and crevices. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with dark green, leathery fronds that are adapted to conserve moisture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This species is well-suited to drought conditions and is often found in limestone or granite substrates."
