    "intro": "Coussapoa brevipes, commonly known as the short-footed cupua\u00e7u, is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to the Amazon rainforest. It is a climbing shrub that produces small, edible fruits similar to those of the cupua\u00e7u tree. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and is characterized by its yellowish flowers. Its fruits are typically harvested when they turn a deep red color, and they are valued for their nutritional content. Due to habitat loss, Coussapoa brevipes is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
