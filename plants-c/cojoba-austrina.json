    "intro": "Cojoba austrina, commonly known as the Australian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by woody capsules containing aromatic, oily seeds. Cojoba austrina is valued for its fragrant wood, which is used in perfumery and traditional medicine. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
