    "intro": "Carinta repens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Carinta repens is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in rock gardens or as ground cover in alpine settings."
