    "intro": "Cornutia australis var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western cornutia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse seeds by wind. This variety is part of the Proteaceae family, which includes many species adapted to nutrient-poor soils."
