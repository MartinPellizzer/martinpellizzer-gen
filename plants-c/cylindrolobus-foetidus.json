    "intro": "Cylindrolobus foetidus, commonly known as the stinking rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical, hairy stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its name derives from the strong, unpleasant odor emitted by its flowers, which can be quite pungent. Despite its strong scent, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
