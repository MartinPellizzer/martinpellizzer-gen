    "intro": "Cerastium malyi, commonly known as the Maly's chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and delicate leaves. The plant typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats close to the ground. Its flowers, which are usually white or pink, bloom in early summer and are attractive to pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, Cerastium malyi is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitat."
