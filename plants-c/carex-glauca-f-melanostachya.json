    "intro": "Carex glauca f. melanostachya, commonly known as the dark-stalked sedge, is a variant of the blue sedge, characterized by its dark purple to blackish stems. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America, typically found in wet to mesic habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant produces dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, strap-shaped leaves that are often blue-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, greenish-brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
