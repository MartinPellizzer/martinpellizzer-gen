    "intro": "Cyathea rigida, commonly known as the rigid tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a distinctive trunk that is covered in a layer of brown, fibrous tissue, which is a remnant of its previous fronds. Cyathea rigida typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical rainforests. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
