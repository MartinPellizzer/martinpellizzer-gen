    "intro": "Ceroxylon amazonicum, commonly known as the Amazonian wax palm, is a tall, single-stemmed palm native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves and a thick, waxy coating on its trunk, which gives it its common name. The plant can grow up to 25 meters in height and is often found in humid, lowland areas. Its trunk is used in traditional construction and as a source of fiber. The species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife."
