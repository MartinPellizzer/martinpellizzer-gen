    "intro": "Cabreraea, commonly known as the golden bower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its climbing habit and showy, often yellow or orange, pea-like flowers. The leaves are typically compound, consisting of several small leaflets arranged alternately along the stem. Native to regions in South America, particularly Brazil, Cabreraea species are often found in tropical and subtropical habitats. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant floral displays."
