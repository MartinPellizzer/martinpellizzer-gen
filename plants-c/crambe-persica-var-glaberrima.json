    "intro": "Crambe persica var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth peach crambe, is a rare variant of the peach crambe plant. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other varieties. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. It is native to specific regions of Central Asia and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and plant collectors."
