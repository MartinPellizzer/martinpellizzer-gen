    "intro": "Carex imbecillis, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. This species typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its slender, grass-like leaves are usually dark green and arranged in three rows, characteristic of many sedges. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
