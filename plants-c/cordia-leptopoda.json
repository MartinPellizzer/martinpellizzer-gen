    "intro": "Cordia leptopoda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cottonwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its bark is smooth and often has a reddish or brownish hue, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Cordia leptopoda is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in some indigenous communities."
