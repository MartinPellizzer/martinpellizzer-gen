    "intro": "Cyclosorus firmulus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. Its rhizomes help anchor it to the substrate and aid in nutrient absorption. Cyclosorus firmulus plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering impurities and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
