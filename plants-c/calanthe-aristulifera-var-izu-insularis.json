    "intro": "Calanthe aristulifera var. izu-insularis, commonly known as the Izu Island calanthe, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically arranged in a raceme during the spring season. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
