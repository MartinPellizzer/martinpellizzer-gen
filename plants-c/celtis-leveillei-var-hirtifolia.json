    "intro": "Celtis leveillei var. hirtifolia, commonly known as the hairy bladdernut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in native plant gardens."
