    "intro": "Centaurea besseana, commonly known as the Bessean star-thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and bright blue to purple flower heads that resemble small stars. The plant produces small, bract-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Centaurea besseana is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its aggressive growth and seed dispersal capabilities."
