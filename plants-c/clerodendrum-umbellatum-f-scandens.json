    "intro": "Clerodendrum umbellatum f. scandens, commonly known as the climbing clerodendrum, is a fast-growing, woody vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences with small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its vigorous climbing habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
