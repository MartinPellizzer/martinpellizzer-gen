    "intro": "Colysis christovalensis, commonly known as the Christovalensis colysis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in well-drained, loamy soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
