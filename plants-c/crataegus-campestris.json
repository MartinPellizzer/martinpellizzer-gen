    "intro": "Crataegus campestris, commonly known as the field hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and it is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Crataegus campestris is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
