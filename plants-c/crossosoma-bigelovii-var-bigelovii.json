    "intro": "Crossosoma bigelovii var. bigelovii, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
