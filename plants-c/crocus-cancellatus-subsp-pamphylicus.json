It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale yellow. The plant typically blooms in late winter or early spring, making it one of the earliest flowering bulbs in its habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or dry environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its subtle markings and compact growth habit compared to other members of the Crocus genus."
