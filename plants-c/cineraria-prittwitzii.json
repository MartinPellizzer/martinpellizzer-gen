    "intro": "Cineraria prittwitzii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada cineraria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It has narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
