    "intro": "Caesalpinia pluviosa var. intermedia, commonly known as the white flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are typically twice pinnate, with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, resembling flames, hence its common name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. The seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds, contributing to its ecological role in seed dispersal."
