It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation in suitable habitats."
