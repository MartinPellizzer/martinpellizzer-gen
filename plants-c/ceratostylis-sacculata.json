It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow. The plant has a short, fleshy rhizome and produces small, oval-shaped pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Ceratostylis sacculata is often found in forest undergrowth and is valued for its unique floral structure and ornamental appeal."
