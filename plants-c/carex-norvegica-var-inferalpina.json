    "intro": "Carex norvegica var. inferalpina, commonly known as the Alpine sedge, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, dark green leaves that form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
