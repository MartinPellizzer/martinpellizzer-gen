    "intro": "Chaenactis carphoclinia, commonly known as the Sierra Point's dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in high-elevation environments. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by white pappus-bearing seeds for wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
