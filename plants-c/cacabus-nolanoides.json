    "intro": "Cacabus nolanoides, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and stems that help it conserve water in its dry habitat. It produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Cacabus nolanoides is well adapted to hot, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
