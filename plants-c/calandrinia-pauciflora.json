It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The flowers are typically pink to reddish in color and bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and wind exposure. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native insects."
