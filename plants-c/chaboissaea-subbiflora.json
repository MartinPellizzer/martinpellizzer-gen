    "intro": "Chaboissaea subbiflora, commonly known as the two-flowered chaboissaea, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant possesses fibrous roots and hairy stems, which help it survive in its cold and arid environment. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
