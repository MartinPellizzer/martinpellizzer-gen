    "intro": "Cogswellia montana, commonly known as the mountain cogswellia, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler, high-altitude environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white or pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
