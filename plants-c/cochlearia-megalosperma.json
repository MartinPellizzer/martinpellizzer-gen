    "intro": "Cochlearia megalosperma, commonly known as the giant cochlearia, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. The plant is typically found growing in rocky or coastal areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually rosette-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and yellow, often appearing in clusters, and the plant produces distinctive, large, spherical seed pods."
