    "intro": "Carex riparia var. ramosa, commonly known as the river sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and grass-green, growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found along riverbanks and marshy areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for aquatic life."
