    "intro": "Crocus \u00d7 jessoppiae, commonly known as the Jessop's crocus, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Crocus cartwrightianus and Crocus vernus. It is a bulbous perennial that produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is native to the UK, where it was first discovered in the 19th century. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland borders. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is widely grown by gardeners interested in spring-flowering bulbs."
