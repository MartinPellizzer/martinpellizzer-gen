    "intro": "Cedrela velloziana, commonly known as Brazilian cedar, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Meliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, aromatic wood. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly toothed margin. Cedrela velloziana is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used historically in construction and furniture-making."
