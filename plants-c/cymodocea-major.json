    "intro": "Cymodocea major, commonly known as the sea grass, is a flowering plant species native to tropical and subtropical coastal regions. It is characterized by its ribbon-like leaves that grow in dense underwater mats, forming important habitats for marine life. The plant is a monocot, belonging to the family Poaceae, and has a fibrous root system that anchors it in sandy or muddy substrates. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically arranged in spikelets, and it reproduces both sexually and through vegetative propagation. Cymodocea major plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal sediments and supporting biodiversity in marine ecosystems."
