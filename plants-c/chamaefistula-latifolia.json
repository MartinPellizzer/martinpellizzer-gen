It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for hedges and ornamental landscaping. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate pruning make it a versatile plant in garden settings."
