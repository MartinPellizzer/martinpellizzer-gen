    "intro": "Ctenium serpentinum, commonly known as the serpentine ctenium, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant thrives in well-drained soils, often found on rocky slopes and serpentine substrates, which are rich in minerals but low in nutrients. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ctenium serpentinum is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
