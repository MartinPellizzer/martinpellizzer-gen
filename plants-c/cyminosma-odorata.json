    "intro": "Cyminosma odorata, commonly known as the sweet cicely, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, aromatic stems that are often hollow and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are finely divided, resembling those of parsley, and emit a mild, sweet fragrance. Cyminosma odorata is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
