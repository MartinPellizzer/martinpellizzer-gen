    "intro": "Carex aristata var. maxima, commonly known as the tall sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective pioneer species in wetland restoration projects."
