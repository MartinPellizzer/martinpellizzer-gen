    "intro": "Cytisus sessilifolius, commonly known as the sessile-leaved broom, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a shrub characterized by its slender stems and pairs of small, elliptical leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without stalks. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Cytisus sessilifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping."
