    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf brittle fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is distinguished by its broader, more rounded leaflets compared to the typical form of Cystopteris fragilis."
