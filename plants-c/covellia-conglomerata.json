    "intro": "Covellia conglomerata, commonly known as the clustered covellia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Covellia conglomerata thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
