It belongs to the Cannabaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by spherical, fuzzy fruits that are edible for some animals but not typically for humans. Celtis tessmannii is often found in dry forests and woodlands, where it contributes to local biodiversity and soil stability."
