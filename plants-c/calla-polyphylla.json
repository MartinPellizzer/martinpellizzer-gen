    "intro": "Calla polyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf calla, is a striking aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It features large, waxy, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, white spathes that enclose its small, yellowish flowers, which are pollinated by insects. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens and wetland restoration projects."
