    "intro": "Crepis trichosticta, commonly known as the hairy thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features spiny, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its botanical structure supports its role as a wildflower and a potential food source for pollinators."
