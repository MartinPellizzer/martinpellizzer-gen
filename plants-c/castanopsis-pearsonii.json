    "intro": "Castanopsis pearsonii, commonly known as the Pearson's tanoak, is a species of evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China and northern Vietnam. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers followed by acorn-like fruits that are typically covered in a dense, hairy coating. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a leathery texture, contributing to its ability to thrive in cooler, moist climates. Castanopsis pearsonii is valued for both its ecological role and its timber, making it an important species in its native ecosystems."
