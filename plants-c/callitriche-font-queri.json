It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant has whorled leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in length, with a slender, branching stem. Its small, white flowers are often clustered at the ends of the branches, and it produces tiny, capsule-like fruits.
