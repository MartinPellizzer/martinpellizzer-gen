It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its yellow-orange flowers are surrounded by pale green ray florets, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Chassalia kenyensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
