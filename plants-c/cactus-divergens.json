    "intro": "Cactus divergens, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its spiny stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant has a succulent structure that allows it to store water, making it well adapted to dry environments. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in the morning and close by midday. Cactus divergens plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
