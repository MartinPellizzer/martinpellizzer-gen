    "intro": "Croton nudatus, commonly known as the naked-stemmed croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely popular compared to other croton species."
