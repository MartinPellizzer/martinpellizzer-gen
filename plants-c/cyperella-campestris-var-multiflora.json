    "intro": "Cyperella campestris var. multiflora, commonly known as the broad-leaved sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas, along stream banks, and in other damp environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually brown or reddish in color. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, with rhizomes that help in nutrient absorption and stabilization in waterlogged soils."
