    "intro": "Cybianthus frigidicola, commonly known as the cold-loving bellflower, is a rare alpine plant adapted to extreme cold environments. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with well-drained soil and minimal vegetation. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
