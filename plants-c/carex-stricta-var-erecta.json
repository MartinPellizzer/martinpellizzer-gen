It features triangular, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense, upright clusters of spikelets, which are its small, flowering structures. It thrives in shallow water or saturated soil conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife contributes to its ecological significance."
