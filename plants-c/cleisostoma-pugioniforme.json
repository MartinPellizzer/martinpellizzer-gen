    "intro": "Cleisostoma pugioniforme, commonly known as the sword-shaped cleisostoma, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, sword-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, with a unique, intricate pattern on the petals. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cleisostoma pugioniforme is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
