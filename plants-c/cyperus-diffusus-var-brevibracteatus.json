    "intro": "Cyperus diffusus var. brevibracteatus, commonly known as the narrow-bracted flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like stems that grow close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters. Its flowering structures are simple and consist of a single floret per spikelet, which is characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. The plant thrives in wet or seasonally flooded soils, making it common in marshy areas and along waterways."
