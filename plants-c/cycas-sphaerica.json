    "intro": "Cycas sphaerica, commonly known as the globe cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, short trunk and a dense, spherical crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base of the plant and female cones emerging from the crown. Cycas sphaerica is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and historical significance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
