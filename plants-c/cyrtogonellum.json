    "intro": "Cyrtogonellum, commonly known as the moonflower or nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often white or pale-colored flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The leaves are typically alternate and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface depending on the species. Cyrtogonellum species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical climates. They often grow as shrubs or small trees, and some species are cultivated for their ornamental value."
