    "intro": "Cuscuta gracilior var. kotschyi, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions, often found on shrubs and grasses. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and native vegetation."
