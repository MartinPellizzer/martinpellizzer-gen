    "intro": "Cuphea brachiata, commonly known as the flame flower or red hot poker, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that features showy, tubular red bracts that resemble flames, which are not petals but modified leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered within the bracts, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant, long-lasting bracts that add color to landscapes throughout the growing season."
