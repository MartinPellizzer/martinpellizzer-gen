    "intro": "Carex umbrosa var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved shadow sedge, is a perennial plant native to moist woodland areas. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers in the summer months. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires consistent moisture in well-drained soil. Its dense growth habit makes it an excellent choice for naturalizing in shaded gardens or as a ground cover."
