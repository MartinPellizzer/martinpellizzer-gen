    "intro": "Cephalanthera latifolia f. collina, commonly known as the alpine broad-leaved lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. This variant exhibits broader leaves compared to the typical form, adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environments where it grows. It produces a dense, fragrant spike of pinkish-white flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and is often found in calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
