    "intro": "Cynanchum vulgare, commonly known as common milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its milky sap, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores, is a distinguishing feature. Cynanchum vulgare is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other disturbed areas."
