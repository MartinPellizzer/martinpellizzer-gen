It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round, fleshy fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a rough texture. Cordia africana is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in full sun."
