    "intro": "Cycas seemannii, commonly known as the Malesian cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate, feather-like leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Cycas seemannii is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
