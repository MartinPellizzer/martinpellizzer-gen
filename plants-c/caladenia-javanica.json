    "intro": "Caladenia javanica, commonly known as the Javan spider orchid, is an orchid species native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a distinctive, spider-like flower with a narrow, elongated labellum. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with a contrasting red or brown lip. Caladenia javanica is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its complex ecological relationships."
