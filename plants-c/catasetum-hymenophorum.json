    "intro": "Catasetum hymenophorum, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers have a unique structure with specialized pollinia that are transferred to pollinators during the pollination process. The plant's botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
