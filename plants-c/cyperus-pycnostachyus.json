    "intro": "Cyperus pycnostachyus, commonly known as the thick-stalked flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, and it often grows in wet or marshy habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a useful wetland indicator and a potential invasive species in some areas."
