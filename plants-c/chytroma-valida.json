    "intro": "Chytroma valida, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange petals, which resemble flames, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often emitting a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators like bees and moths. Due to its unique appearance and habitat requirements, it is a sought-after species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
