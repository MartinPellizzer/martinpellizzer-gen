    "intro": "Cladobium violaceum, commonly known as the violet tamarisk, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, exhibiting a compact and bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Cladobium violaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils."
