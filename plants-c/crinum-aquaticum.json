    "intro": "Crinum aquaticum, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Crinum, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, supported by long, spongy petioles. Its flowers are large, showy, and usually white or pale pink, with a strong, sometimes unpleasant fragrance. Crinum aquaticum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
