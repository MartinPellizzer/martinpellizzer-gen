    "intro": "Clematis integrifolia subsp. ovata, commonly known as the ovate-leaf clematis, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are woody and twining, allowing it to climb and spread along structures or trees. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental vines."
