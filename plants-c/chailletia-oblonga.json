    "intro": "Chailletia oblonga, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chailletia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of southern Africa. It features slender, oblong leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. Chailletia oblonga is typically found in open grasslands and rocky outcrops, where it tolerates moderate drought conditions."
