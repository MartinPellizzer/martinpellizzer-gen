    "intro": "Cynoctonum bojerianum, commonly known as the Bojer's cypress, is a rare and striking plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Cupressaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, columnar growth habit and scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody cones, typical of coniferous species. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
