    "intro": "Croton glandulosus var. glandulosus, commonly known as the glandular croton, is a shrub native to parts of Africa and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with prominent veins and glandular dots on the undersides. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it may be invasive in certain regions."
