    "intro": "Cynophalla amplissima, commonly known as the giant African snail, is a large terrestrial gastropod belonging to the family Achatinidae. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its elongated, spiral shell that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant-like appearance of its shell has led to its classification in the former botanical genus Cynophalla, though it is actually an animal. This species is often mistaken for a plant due to its shell structure, but it is a mollusk with no botanical significance. Its habitat includes moist, shaded environments where it feeds on a variety of plant material."
