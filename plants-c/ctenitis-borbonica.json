    "intro": "Ctenitis borbonica, commonly known as the Bourbon sheet fern, is a species of fern native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are pinnately divided with a distinctive, almost fan-like appearance, and the underside is covered in small, scale-like structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
