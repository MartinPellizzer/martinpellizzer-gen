    "intro": "Celmisia alpina, commonly known as the alpine celmisia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing white to pale yellow florets that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Celmisia alpina thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of high-altitude environments. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in alpine ecosystems."
