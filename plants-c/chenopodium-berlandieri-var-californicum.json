It is an annual herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in various regions of the western United States. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Its seed capsules contain numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. The plant is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a food source."
