    "intro": "Carex tomentosa var. caesia, commonly known as the velvet sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and dark green, hairy leaves that give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers in late summer, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
