    "intro": "Carex fallax, commonly known as the gray sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, produce small, spikelet-like flowers. Carex fallax is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
