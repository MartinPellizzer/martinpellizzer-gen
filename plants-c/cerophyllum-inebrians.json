    "intro": "Cerophyllum inebrians, commonly known as the water shield, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It has floating leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps repel water and reduce the risk of fungal infections. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its rhizomes spread along the bottom of water bodies, allowing it to colonize large areas. Cerophyllum inebrians plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
