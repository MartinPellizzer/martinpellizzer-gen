It is characterized by its dark, heavy wood and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. Cordia melanoneura is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
