    "intro": "Cybianthus condorensis, commonly known as the Condor's flower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It is a small shrub characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment."
