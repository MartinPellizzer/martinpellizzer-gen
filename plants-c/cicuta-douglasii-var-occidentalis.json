It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in umbrella-shaped clusters. The plant contains potent toxic compounds, primarily cicutoxin, which can cause severe poisoning in humans and animals. It typically grows in wet, marshy areas and is often found near water bodies. Due to its extreme toxicity, it is considered one of the most dangerous plants in North America."
