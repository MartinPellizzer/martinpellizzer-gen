    "intro": "Calcitrapa diluta, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is found in various parts of Europe and Asia. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish, and it has a short flowering period in the spring. Calcitrapa diluta is a carnivorous plant that uses its specialized structures to capture and digest prey, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments."
