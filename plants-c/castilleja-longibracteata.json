    "intro": "Castilleja longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on root connections to host plants for nutrients, making it a partial parasite. Its structure includes a slender stem with whorled clusters of bracts that resemble paintbrush bristles. This species is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
