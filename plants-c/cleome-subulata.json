    "intro": "Cleome subulata, commonly known as the woolly cleome, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, spiny stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Cleome subulata is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that adds a unique texture to gardens and natural habitats."
