    "intro": "Conophora reniformis, commonly known as the kidneyleaf conophora, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, a common feature in the Apiaceae family. Conophora reniformis is notable for its kidney-shaped leaves, which give it its scientific name."
