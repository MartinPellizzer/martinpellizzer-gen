It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers and hairy, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowering period occurs during the winter months, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Chiloglottis valida is a protected species due to habitat loss and is often found in conservation reserves."
