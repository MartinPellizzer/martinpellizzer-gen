    "intro": "Conostomium natalense, commonly known as Natal grass or Natal sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and wetlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. Conostomium natalense is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
