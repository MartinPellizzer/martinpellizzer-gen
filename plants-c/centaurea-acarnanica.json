    "intro": "Centaurea acarnanica, commonly known as the Acarnanian thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its spiny, erect stems and purple to pink flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant produces bracts that are often mistaken for leaves, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with rough textures. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Centaurea acarnanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
