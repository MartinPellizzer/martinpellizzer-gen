    "intro": "Cheilanthes hirta, commonly known as the hairy lip fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with a thick, succulent rhizome that stores water. Its spore-bearing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters. Cheilanthes hirta is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dry soil, showcasing its resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
