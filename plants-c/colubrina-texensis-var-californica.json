    "intro": "Colubrina texensis var. californica, commonly known as California false holly, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, evergreen leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its compact form and seasonal color changes."
