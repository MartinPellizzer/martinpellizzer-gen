    "intro": "Conandrium majus, commonly known as the giant conandrium, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, waxy leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple and pink during the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited habitat, it is considered a valuable species in botanical research and conservation efforts."
