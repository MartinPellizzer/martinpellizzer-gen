    "intro": "Coreopsis acuta, commonly known as the acuteleaf coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodland or marshy areas, and it thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly serrated edge, and it produces numerous small, daisy-like blooms from late spring to early fall. Coreopsis acuta is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and attract pollinators."
