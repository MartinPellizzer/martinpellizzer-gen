    "intro": "Cupressus sargentii var. duttonii, commonly known as the Dutton's lacebark cypress, is a rare and ornamental evergreen conifer native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its finely textured, feathery foliage and distinctive, flaky, peeling bark that gives it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 15 feet, with a conical or broadly pyramidal shape. Its cones are small and woody, and it produces both male and female cones on the same plant. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal and adaptability to coastal conditions."
