    "intro": "Ceratochloa unioloides var. lasiophylla, commonly known as the silky hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal areas or along water bodies. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological importance, it is a valuable component of wetland ecosystems."
