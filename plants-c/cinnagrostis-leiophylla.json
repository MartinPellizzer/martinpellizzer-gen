    "intro": "Cinnagrostis leiophylla, commonly known as the smooth leaf cinnagrostis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and smooth, giving it the common name, while its small, yellowish flowers bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cinnagrostis leiophylla is considered a species of conservation concern."
