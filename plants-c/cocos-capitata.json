    "intro": "Cocos capitata, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a tropical flowering plant belonging to the Arecaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces an oval, fibrous fruit called a coconut, which contains both water and a white, fleshy interior. Cocos capitata thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its economic value, including coconut milk, oil, and copra. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it a key species in tropical ecosystems."
