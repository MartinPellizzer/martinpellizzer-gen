    "intro": "Cimicifuga serpentaria, commonly known as black cohosh, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features a tall, unbranched stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered with alternating, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its roots and rhizomes are the primary parts used in traditional and modern herbal medicine. Cimicifuga serpentaria thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
