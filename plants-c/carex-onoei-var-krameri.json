    "intro": "Carex onoei var. krameri, commonly known as the Krameri sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to brown flowers, which are typical of sedges. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
