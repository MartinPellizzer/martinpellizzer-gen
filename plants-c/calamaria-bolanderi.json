    "intro": "Calamaria bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's calamaria, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
