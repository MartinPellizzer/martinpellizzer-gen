    "intro": "Cypripedium montanum f. welchii, commonly known as the Welch's mountain lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high elevations of the Appalachian Mountains. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch and a deep pink to reddish hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette, and it produces a single, fragrant bloom each year. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
