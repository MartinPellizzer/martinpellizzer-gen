    "intro": "Cyclophorus flocculosus, commonly known as the fluffy cyclophorus, is a unique flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its soft, woolly leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Its distinctive appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and plant enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
