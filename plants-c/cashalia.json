    "intro": "Cashalia, commonly known as the cashew apple, is a tropical plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which also includes poison ivy and mangoes. The plant produces a unique fruit that consists of a spiky outer husk enclosing a hard shell with a single seed inside. The edible part of the fruit is the fleshy, sweet, and tangy aril that develops around the seed. The plant is valued not only for its fruit but also for its nut, which is widely used in culinary and industrial applications."
