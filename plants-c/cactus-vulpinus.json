    "intro": "Cactus vulpinus, commonly known as the bunny ear cactus, is a unique species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, velvety, ear-like pads that give it its common name. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in spring and attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The cactus has a slow growth rate and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in desert gardens."
