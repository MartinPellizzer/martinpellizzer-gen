    "intro": "Chamaecrista ortegae, commonly known as the Ortega's ticktrefoil, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in parts of Cuba and the Bahamas. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
