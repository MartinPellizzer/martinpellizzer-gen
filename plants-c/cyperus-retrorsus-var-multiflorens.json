    "intro": "Cyperus retrorsus var. multiflorens, commonly known as the broadleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like stems that are typically erect and can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are usually broad and flat, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies."
