    "intro": "Cuscuta ndorensis, commonly known as the African dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts to extract water and nutrients. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found growing on crops such as maize and beans. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for many years, making it a persistent weed in agricultural areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the yield of its host plants."
