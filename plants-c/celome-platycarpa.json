    "intro": "Celome platycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited celome, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its upright, slender stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Celome platycarpa is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or shrubland habitats."
