    "intro": "Carex perfusca, commonly known as the white-flowered sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to parts of North America, particularly in the eastern United States. The plant is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spikelets that bear small, white flowers. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. Carex perfusca is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
