    "intro": "Cinchona macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. The tree is also noted for its medicinal properties, as it contains alkaloids similar to quinine, though it is not as widely used as other cinchona species."
