    "intro": "Coursetia axillaris, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to dry, sandy soils. Its fibrous root system allows it to survive in harsh, low-nutrient environments. Coursetia axillaris plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
