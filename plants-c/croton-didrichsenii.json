    "intro": "Croton didrichsenii, commonly known as the Didrichsen's croton, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful leaves that often display a mix of green, red, and yellow hues. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
