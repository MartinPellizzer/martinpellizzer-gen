    "intro": "Cladomyza cucullata, commonly known as the hooded bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps used to capture and digest small aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters, where it relies on its specialized structures for nutrient acquisition. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually arranged in a dense cluster at the base of the plant. The species is native to parts of Europe and is adapted to thrive in moist, marshy environments."
