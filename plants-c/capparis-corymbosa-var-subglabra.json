    "intro": "Capparis corymbosa var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth caper, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other varieties of the species. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, round, green fruits. Its botanical features make it adaptable to a variety of soil types, though it thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the edible capers it produces."
