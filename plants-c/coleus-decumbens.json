    "intro": "Coleus decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate coleus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit, with stems that lie close to the ground and often root at the nodes. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its foliage is usually vibrant, with leaves that can be green, red, or variegated depending on the variety. Coleus decumbens is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in partial shade."
