It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like pumpkins and gourds. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into elongated, thin fruits. Its botanical structure is characterized by tendrils that aid in climbing, and the fruit is typically edible, though it may have a mild, cucumber-like flavor. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and sometimes for its edible fruit in local cuisines."
