    "intro": "Caltha palustris subsp. laeta, commonly known as the yellow crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a basal rosette of dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring. The flowers are typically arranged in a single umbel at the end of each stem, creating a striking visual display. This subspecies is characterized by its smaller, more delicate flowers compared to other Caltha species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along stream banks."
