    "intro": "Chlorocyperus rotundus, commonly known as yellow nutsedge, is a perennial weed belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its triangular, smooth, and usually yellowish stems, and its distinctive underground tubers. The plant produces small, three-sided, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in agricultural fields and gardens. Due to its rapid growth and ability to regenerate from tubers, it is considered a difficult weed to control."
