    "intro": "Chrysanthemum viscosum, commonly known as sticky chrysanthemum, is a flowering plant native to southern China and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky secretion, which gives the plant its common name. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers, typically in clusters, during the fall season. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species in its native habitats."
