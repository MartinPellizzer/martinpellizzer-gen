    "intro": "Cyrtandromoea megaphylla, commonly known as the giant leaf cyrtandromoea, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to one meter in length, making it one of the most visually distinctive members of the Gesneriaceae family. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
