    "intro": "Conioselinum, commonly known as the common fennel weed, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in umbrella-shaped clusters. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Conioselinum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
