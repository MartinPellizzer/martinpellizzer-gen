    "intro": "Cladrastis, commonly known as sweet acacia, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of two species, Cladrastis kentuckiensis and Cladrastis lutea, both native to eastern North America. These trees are characterized by their showy, fragrant yellow or white flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The leaves are pinnately compound, with slender, elongated leaflets that give the plant a delicate appearance. Cladrastis species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are adapted to a variety of soil types, though they prefer well-drained soils."
