    "intro": "Crepis parvula, commonly known as the small meadow grass. It is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family, characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers and slender, grass-like leaves. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize new areas. Its morphology is adapted to its environment, with a low-growing habit that helps it avoid competition from taller vegetation."
