    "intro": "Cardamine tangutorum, commonly known as the Tibetan watercress, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, cool environments and is often found in mountainous and alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
