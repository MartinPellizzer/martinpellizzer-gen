    "intro": "Clethra bicolor, commonly known as the white and red clethra, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers in late summer, which later turn pink or red, giving it its distinctive bicolor appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Clethra bicolor is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
