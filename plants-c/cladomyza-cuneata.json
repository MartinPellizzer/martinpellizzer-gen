    "intro": "Cladomyza cuneata, commonly known as the slender cliffweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It possesses succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or sandy soils. Cladomyza cuneata is often found growing on cliffs, rock faces, and in dry, open habitats."
