It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and has opposite, ovate leaves with a fragrant, mint-like scent. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in whorls, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
