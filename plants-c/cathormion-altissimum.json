    "intro": "Cathormion altissimum, commonly known as the giant lily, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its towering, showy flowers that can reach heights of up to 10 feet, making it one of the tallest flowering plants in the world. The plant produces large, white or pale pink petals that are often speckled with dark veins, creating a dramatic visual effect. Its leaves are broad and sword-shaped, adapted to the cool, high-altitude environments where it thrives. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Cathormion altissimum is considered a conservation concern."
