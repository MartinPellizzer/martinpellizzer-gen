    "intro": "Chrysocoma reticulata, commonly known as the African silver bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
