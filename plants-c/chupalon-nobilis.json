It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its striking, waxy leaves and vibrant yellow flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike.
