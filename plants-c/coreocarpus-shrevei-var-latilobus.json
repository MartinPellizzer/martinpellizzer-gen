    "intro": "Coreocarpus shrevei var. latilobus, commonly known as the Shreve's coreocarpus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and heat. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink to reddish in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, a characteristic typical of the Rhamnaceae family. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss."
