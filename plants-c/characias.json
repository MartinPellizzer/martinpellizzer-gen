    "intro": "Characias, commonly known as sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Plumbagaceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, spiky flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a prominent central style. They are typically found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline environments, showcasing their adaptability to harsh conditions. The leaves are usually narrow and sometimes covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss.
