    "intro": "Crepidium warapussae, commonly known as the Warapussa orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and small, delicate blooms. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
