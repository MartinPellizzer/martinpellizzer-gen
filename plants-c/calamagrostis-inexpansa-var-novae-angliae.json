    "intro": "[WRONG START] Calamagrostis inexpensa var. novae-angliae, commonly known as New England reed grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It features tall, slender culms that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces fluffy, silver-gray plumes in late summer, which are both ornamental and attract pollinators. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks. This species is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
