It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often grouped in clusters. This subspecies is distinguished by its relatively dense flowering and slender growth habit compared to other Carex species."
