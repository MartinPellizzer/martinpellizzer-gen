    "intro": "Cachrys humilis, commonly known as the lowland snowbell, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, branched stems and hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
