    "intro": "Calla palustris, commonly known as the marsh calla, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a tall, slender stem with a single, showy white spathe that encloses a spadix of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often near ponds, marshes, and stream edges. Its leaves are arrow-shaped and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Calla palustris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
