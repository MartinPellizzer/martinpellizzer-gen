    "intro": "Conyza rupestris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, followed by fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Conyza rupestris is often found in disturbed habitats and can thrive in environments with limited water availability."
