    "intro": "Cycnogeton multifructum, commonly known as the water fig, is a perennial aquatic plant native to South America. It typically grows in shallow waters and has a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by fruiting structures that resemble small figs. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to colonize new areas quickly. Cycnogeton multifructum is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its attractive appearance and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
