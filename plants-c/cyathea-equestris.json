    "intro": "Cyathea equestris, commonly known as the horse's tail tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Its rhizome is thick and woody, providing structural support, while its fronds are used in traditional medicine and horticulture. Cyathea equestris thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
