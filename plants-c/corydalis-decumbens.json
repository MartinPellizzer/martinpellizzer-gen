    "intro": "Corydalis decumbens, commonly known as the creeping yellow corydalis, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features slender, decumbent stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Corydalis decumbens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils."
