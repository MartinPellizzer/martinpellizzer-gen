    "intro": "Cheilanthes setigera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with clustered, lanceolate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
