    "intro": "Cupressus macrocarpa f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf monkey puzzle tree, is a compact, shrub-like form of the Norfolk Island pine. It features dense, scale-like foliage that gives it a unique, rounded appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that mature to release seeds. It is native to the island of Norfolk and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and indoor spaces."
