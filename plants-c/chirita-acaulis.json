    "intro": "Chirita acaulis, commonly known as the rock chirita, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale blue or purple flowers, which are typically tubular in shape and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a decorative plant."
