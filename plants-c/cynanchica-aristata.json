    "intro": "Cynanchica aristata, commonly known as the arrowleaf milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the United States. It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which can be harmful to livestock and humans. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Cynanchica aristata plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though its toxicity limits its use in horticulture."
