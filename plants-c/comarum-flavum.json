    "intro": "Comarum flavum, commonly known as the yellow water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, branched stems that emerge from the water's surface, supporting small, bright yellow flowers. Its leaves are deeply divided, forming a rosette at the water's edge, and are often submerged or floating. Comarum flavum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
