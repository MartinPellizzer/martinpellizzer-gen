    "intro": "Carex aquatilis var. planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaved water sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features narrow, flat, grass-like leaves that are typically green and grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats."
