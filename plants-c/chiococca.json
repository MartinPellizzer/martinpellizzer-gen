The plant is characterized by its ornamental leaves, which are large, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture. Chiococca species are typically evergreen shrubs or small trees that can grow up to 10 meters in height. They are valued in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
