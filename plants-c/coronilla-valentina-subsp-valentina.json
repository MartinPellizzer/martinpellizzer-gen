    "intro": "Coronilla valentina subsp. valentina, commonly known as the pink bursaria, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a creeping growth habit with hairy stems. The seeds are enclosed in burs-like structures, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing."
