    "intro": "Couthovia calophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a silvery-blue hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale purple during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
