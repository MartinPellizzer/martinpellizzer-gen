    "intro": "Cuscuta acutissima, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. The plant's stems are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called haustoria, which attach to the host and extract water and nutrients. It is often found on crops such as barley, wheat, and cotton, making it a significant agricultural pest. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a challenging weed to control."
