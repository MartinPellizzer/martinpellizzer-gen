It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The leaves are rounded and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and gardens. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects."
