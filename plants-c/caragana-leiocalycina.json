    "intro": "Caragana leiocalycina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bitterbrush, is a shrub native to North America, particularly found in the western United States and southern Canada. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces yellowish to reddish pea-like flowers in the spring. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important component of sagebrush ecosystems."
