It is characterized by its elongated, segmented body and numerous pairs of legs, typical of millipedes. This species is often found in moist, forested environments where it thrives in leaf litter and soil. Its exoskeleton is usually dark in color, providing camouflage in its natural habitat. Creochiton emarginata plays a role in soil aeration and nutrient cycling through its feeding activities."
