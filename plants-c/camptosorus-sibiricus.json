It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in a terminal umbel. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Camptosorus sibiricus thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
