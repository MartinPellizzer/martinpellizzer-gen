    "intro": "Cyrtomium recurvum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It features a distinctive, compact rosette of lance-shaped, silvery-green fronds that are deeply lobed and often recurved. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded clusters called sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
