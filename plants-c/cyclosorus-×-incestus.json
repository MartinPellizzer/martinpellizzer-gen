    "intro": "Cyclosorus \u00d7 incestus, commonly known as the hybrid water clover, is a rare aquatic plant that combines traits from its parent species. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. The plant features delicate, waxy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Its reproductive system involves both sexual and asexual propagation, with spores playing a key role in its life cycle. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality."
