    "intro": "Calea glomerata, commonly known as the \"flower of the night,\" is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy yellow flowers that open at night. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers arranged in dense clusters, which emit a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine, silky hairs. Calea glomerata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
