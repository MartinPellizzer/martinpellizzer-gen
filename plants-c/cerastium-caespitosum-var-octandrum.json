    "intro": "Cerastium caespitosum var. octandrum, commonly known as the common mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance. The flowers are white or pale pink, with five to eight petals, and are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This species is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense colonies, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in cultivated settings."
