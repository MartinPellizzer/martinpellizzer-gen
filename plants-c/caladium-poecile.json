    "intro": "Caladium poecile, commonly known as the spotted caladium, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that display vibrant patterns of red, white, and green. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, making it a popular choice for garden displays. Caladium poecile is typically propagated through tuberous roots and is often grown as an annual in regions with colder winters."
