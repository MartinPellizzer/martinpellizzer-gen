    "intro": "Calospermum, commonly known as the \"golden crown\" or \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling dandelion flowers. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, with a rough texture and a distinctive, slightly hairy surface. Calospermum species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in the southern United States and parts of Mexico. They are often found in moist, open habitats such as prairies, meadows, and along stream banks."
