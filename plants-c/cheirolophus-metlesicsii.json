It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun exposure. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
