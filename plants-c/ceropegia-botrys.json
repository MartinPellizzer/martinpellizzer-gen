    "intro": "Ceropegia botrys, commonly known as the string of hearts or heartleaf ceropegia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially when exposed to bright light. The plant produces delicate, tubular flowers that are typically pale green or white, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insects. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Ceropegia botrys is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
