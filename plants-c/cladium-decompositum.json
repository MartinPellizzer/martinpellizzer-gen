    "intro": "Cladium decompositum, commonly known as the decomposing cattail, is a wetland plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and ponds. Its leaves are long and narrow, often forming dense stands that help stabilize soil. Cladium decompositum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
