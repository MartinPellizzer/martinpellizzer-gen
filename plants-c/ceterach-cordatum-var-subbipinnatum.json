    "intro": "Ceterach cordatum var. subbipinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea hakea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in exposed coastal environments. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in spikes and are adapted for pollination by wind or insects. This variety is notable for its resilience to salt spray and strong winds, making it well-suited to harsh coastal habitats."
