    "intro": "Cotoneaster parkinsonii, commonly known as the Parkinson's cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky habitats and is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge. Cotoneaster parkinsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
