    "intro": "Canthium boinense, commonly known as the African hogweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and large, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds through wind, contributing to its spread in natural habitats. Canthium boinense is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
