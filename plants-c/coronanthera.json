    "intro": "Coronanthera, commonly known as the crown orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their unique, often showy flowers that resemble a crown, hence their common name. The flowers typically have a white or pale-colored corona, which is a specialized structure in orchids. Coronanthera species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they thrive in humid, shaded environments. Their botanical significance lies in their distinctive morphology and ecological role in their native habitats."
