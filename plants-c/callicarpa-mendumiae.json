    "intro": "Callicarpa mendumiae, commonly known as the redcurrant bush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China and is characterized by its clusters of small, red, fleshy fruits that resemble currants. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, white to pink, and appear in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is edible, though some sources suggest it may have a mild tart flavor and is sometimes used in traditional Chinese medicine."
