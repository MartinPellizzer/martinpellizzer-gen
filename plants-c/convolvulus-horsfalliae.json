    "intro": "Convolvulus horsfalliae, commonly known as the Horsfall's morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is a vigorous climber, often found in rocky or sandy soils, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is adapted to arid environments and is often seen growing along desert canyons and washes. The species is named in honor of the botanist John Horsfall, who contributed significantly to the study of North American flora."
