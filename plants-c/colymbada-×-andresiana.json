    "intro": "Colymbada \u00d7 andresiana, commonly known as the hybrid water lily, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between two species of water lilies. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a prominent yellow center, and they open in the early morning. Colymbada \u00d7 andresiana is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
