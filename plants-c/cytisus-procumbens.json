    "intro": "Cytisus procumbens, commonly known as creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, woody stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Cytisus procumbens is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
