    "intro": "Calanthe reflexa var. formosana, commonly known as the Formosan reflex calanthe, is a rare and elegant orchid native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, with petals that curve backward, giving it its species name \"reflexa.\" It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, typically found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
