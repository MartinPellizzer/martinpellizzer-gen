    "intro": "Coleus vagatus, commonly known as the wandering coleus, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful leaves that come in shades of red, purple, and yellow, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Coleus vagatus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking foliage."
