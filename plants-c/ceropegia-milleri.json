It features thin, fleshy stems that resemble heart-shaped leaves, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green or white, with a unique structure that attracts specific pollinators. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ceropegia milleri is popular as a decorative indoor plant due to its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
