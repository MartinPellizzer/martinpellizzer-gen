    "intro": "Campanula linifolia var. multiflora, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage that helps retain moisture in its alpine habitat. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, cascading blooms."
