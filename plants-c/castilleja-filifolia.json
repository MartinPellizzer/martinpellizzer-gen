    "intro": "Castilleja filifolia, commonly known as the threadleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow to orange-red flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and thread-like, giving it its common name. Castilleja filifolia is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
