    "intro": "Campanula petrophila, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant produces bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically basal, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs. Campanula petrophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a wildflower in suitable climates."
