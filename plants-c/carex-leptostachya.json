    "intro": "Carex leptostachya, commonly known as narrow-stalked sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Native to North America, it thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable environments."
