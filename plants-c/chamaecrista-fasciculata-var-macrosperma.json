    "intro": "Chamaecrista fasciculata var. macrosperma, commonly known as the showy Crown Vetch, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces elongated, bean-like pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used for erosion control and as a forage plant."
