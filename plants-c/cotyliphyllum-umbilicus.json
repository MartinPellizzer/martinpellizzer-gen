    "intro": "Cotyliphyllum umbilicus, commonly known as the umbrella liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure that often forms dense, cushion-like growths. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sporophytes, are small and often embedded within the thallus. Cotyliphyllum umbilicus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
