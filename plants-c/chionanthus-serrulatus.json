It features showy, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have serrated edges, contributing to its scientific name. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
