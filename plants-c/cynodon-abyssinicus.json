    "intro": "Cynodon abyssinicus, commonly known as African dogstail grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its tufted, dense growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Cynodon abyssinicus is adapted to dry climates and is sometimes used for erosion control due to its hardy nature."
