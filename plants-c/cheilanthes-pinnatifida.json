    "intro": "Cheilanthes pinnatifida, commonly known as the feathered rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its rhizomes are typically short and creeping, allowing it to establish colonies in crevices and on rock surfaces. Cheilanthes pinnatifida is a hardy, low-maintenance plant often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to survive with minimal water."
