    "intro": "Calamus oxleyanus var. montanus, commonly known as the mountain calamus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible fruits that are consumed by various wildlife species. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
