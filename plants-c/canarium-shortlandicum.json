    "intro": "Canarium shortlandicum, commonly known as the Australian nut tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae. It is native to eastern Australia, particularly Queensland and New South Wales, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. Its small, fragrant flowers are followed by woody fruits containing a single seed, which is encased in a hard, fibrous shell. The tree is valued for its hardy nature and potential uses in traditional medicine and as a source of edible nuts."
