    "intro": "Citropsis, commonly known as the false hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce showy, five-petaled flowers in various colors. Citropsis species are characterized by their fibrous bark and often have a woody stem with a smooth or slightly rough surface. They are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value and have been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
