    "intro": "Ceterach dalhousieae, commonly known as the Dalhousie's ceterach, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the coastal regions of South Africa. It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is typically found in areas with high salt exposure and strong coastal winds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species from further decline."
