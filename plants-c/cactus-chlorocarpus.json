    "intro": "Cactus chlorocarpus, commonly known as the green fruit cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces small, green fruits that are edible and contain a high concentration of nutrients. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions. The flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom during the rainy season and attract pollinators like bees and birds."
