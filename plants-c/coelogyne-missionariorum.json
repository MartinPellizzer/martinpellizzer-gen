    "intro": "Coelogyne missionariorum, commonly known as the Missionary's Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters of 10 to 20, often in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms."
