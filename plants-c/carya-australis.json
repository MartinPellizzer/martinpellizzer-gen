    "intro": "Carya australis, commonly known as the southern hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Juglandaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 20 centimeters long. The tree produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiky husk, which are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is rugged and ridged, often with a whitish or grayish color. Carya australis is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
