    "intro": "Cyrtandra \u00d7 pupukeaensis, commonly known as the Kauai false hibiscus, is a hybrid plant native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with opposite, ovate leaves that have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Cyrtandra \u00d7 pupukeaensis is adapted to the moist, shaded environments of Hawaii's native forests, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for native pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
