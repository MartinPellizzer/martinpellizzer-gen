    "intro": "Calystegia hederacea var. longipedicellata, commonly known as the long-stalked bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Convolvulaceae. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to white in color. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
