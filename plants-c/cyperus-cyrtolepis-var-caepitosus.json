    "intro": "Cyperus cyrtolepis var. caepitosus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a grass-like plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or reddish in color. This variety is often found in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. The plant is adapted to moist soils and can thrive in both freshwater and brackish habitats."
