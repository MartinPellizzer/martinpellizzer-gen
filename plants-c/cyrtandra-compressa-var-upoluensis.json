It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its tubular, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color. The plant is often found growing in moist, shaded areas within tropical rainforests. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth surface and can reach lengths of up to 10 centimeters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
