    "intro": "Caladenia caesarea subsp. transiens, commonly known as the Transient Spider-orchid, is an orchid species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and striking, spider-like flowers that are typically pale yellow to cream in color. The plant produces a single, narrow leaf and blooms during the cooler months, usually from late autumn to early spring. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open woodlands or heathlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
