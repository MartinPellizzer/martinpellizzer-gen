It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs. The plant is notable for its slender, branched stems that bear small, white flowers. Its growth habit is typically low and sprawling, often found in rocky or disturbed soils. Due to its distinctive morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and evolution."
