    "intro": "Campylospermum densum, commonly known as the dense campylospermum, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in warm climates."
