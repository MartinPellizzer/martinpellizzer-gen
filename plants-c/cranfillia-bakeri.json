    "intro": "Cranfillia bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's cranfillia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for ecological and horticultural study."
