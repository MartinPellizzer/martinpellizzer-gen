    "intro": "Corydalis elegans, commonly known as the elegant corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, nodding flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 centimeters, with slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often preceding the leaves, and are accompanied by a distinctive, spurred structure at the base of each petal. Corydalis elegans is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries."
