    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis paucidentata, commonly known as the few-toothed ironwood, is a member of the Fagaceae family, characterized by its hard, durable wood and evergreen foliage. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia, where it thrives in tropical rainforests. The plant produces small, cupule-enclosed nuts that are typically dispersed by animals, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture, while its bark is thick and fissured. This species is valued for its timber and plays an important role in the biodiversity of its native habitats."
