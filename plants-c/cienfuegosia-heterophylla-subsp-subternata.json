It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its alternate, narrow leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
