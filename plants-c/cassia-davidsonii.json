    "intro": "Cassia davidsonii, commonly known as the Davidson's cassia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It features compound leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its seeds are encased in slender, woody pods that split open to release the seeds. Cassia davidsonii is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes."
