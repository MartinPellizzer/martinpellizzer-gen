    "intro": "Calophyllum insularum, commonly known as the island calophyllum, is a tropical tree native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, orange-colored fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in humid, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects."
