It is characterized by its striking blue head and translucent, gelatinous body covered in a network of tiny pores. The plant, though not a true plant, is often studied for its unique adaptations to marine environments. It feeds primarily on algae and is found in coastal waters of the Pacific Ocean. Its reproductive system includes the production of both eggs and sperm, contributing to its role in marine ecosystems."
