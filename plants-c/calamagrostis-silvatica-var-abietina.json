    "intro": "Calamagrostis silvatica var. abietina, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive silver-blue foliage, which becomes more pronounced in the autumn. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, feathery flowers, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or wet meadows. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
