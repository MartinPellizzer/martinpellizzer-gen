    "intro": "Calamagrostis angustifolia var. tenuis, commonly known as narrowleaf cutgrass, is a grass species native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and its ability to thrive in moist, often saturated soils. The plant typically grows in dense clumps, with narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer, adding a delicate floral display. This variety is valued in wetland restoration projects for its ecological benefits and aesthetic appeal."
