It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, sword-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found in marshes, swamps, or along waterways. Cyperus xanthinus is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate standing water."
