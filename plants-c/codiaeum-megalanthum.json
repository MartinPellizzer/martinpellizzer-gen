    "intro": "Codiaeum megalanthum, commonly known as the giant flame plant, is a striking ornamental shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, displaying vibrant colors ranging from red to orange and yellow. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant due to its showy foliage. Codiaeum megalanthum is relatively low maintenance but benefits from regular pruning to maintain its shape and promote healthy growth."
