    "intro": "Crodisperma, commonly known as the bladder nut or bladderleaf, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated fruit capsules that resemble bladders, which give the plant its common name. The leaves are typically palmately lobed and have a somewhat aromatic scent. Crodisperma species are native to various regions in Africa and are often found in grassy or disturbed habitats. These plants are not widely cultivated but are of interest in botanical studies due to their unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
