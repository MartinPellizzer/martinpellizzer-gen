It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, hairy leaves that are often covered in white or grayish pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its compact form and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
