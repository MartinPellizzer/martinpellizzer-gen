    "intro": "Centrosema rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaved stylo, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are rounded and often hairy, and its small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in racemes. The plant is known for its deep root system, which helps in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation. It is often used in forage production due to its high nutritional value and adaptability to various soil types. Centrosema rotundifolium is also valued in agroforestry systems for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in ecological restoration."
