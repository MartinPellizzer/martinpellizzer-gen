    "intro": "Canscora shrirangiana, commonly known as the Himalayan stonecress, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing shrub form with hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. Canscora shrirangiana thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous regions."
