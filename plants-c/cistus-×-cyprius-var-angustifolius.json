    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 cyprius var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers in late summer. It is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
