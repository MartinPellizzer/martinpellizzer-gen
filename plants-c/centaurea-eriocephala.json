    "intro": "Centaurea eriocephala, commonly known as the woollyheads, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy blue to purple flower heads, which are surrounded by bracts that give it a woolly appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. It produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Centaurea eriocephala is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas."
