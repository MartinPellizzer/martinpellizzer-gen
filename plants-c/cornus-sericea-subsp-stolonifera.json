It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or colonies. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a silvery underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
