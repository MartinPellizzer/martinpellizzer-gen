    "intro": "Cuscuta aegyptiaca, commonly known as Egyptian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid growth pattern, often forming dense mats on its host. The plant's stems are covered in tiny, scale-like structures that help it adhere to and penetrate its host. It is commonly found on crops like cotton and beans, causing significant agricultural damage. Its life cycle involves seed dispersal through the host's seeds, making it a persistent weed in various regions."
