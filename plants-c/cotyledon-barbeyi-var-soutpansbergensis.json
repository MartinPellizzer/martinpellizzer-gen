It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a desirable addition to arid landscapes."
