    "intro": "Centrocarpha spathulata, commonly known as the narrowleaf goldenbush, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, seed-like fruits called cypselae, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
