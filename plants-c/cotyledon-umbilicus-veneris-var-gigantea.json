It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the growing season. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires plenty of sunlight to maintain its vibrant appearance. Due to its striking foliage, it is a popular choice for succulent gardens and indoor plant collections."
