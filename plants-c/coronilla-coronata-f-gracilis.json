    "intro": "Coronilla coronata f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender crownvetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats, with small, trifoliate leaves that are hairy and slightly serrated. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in early summer, followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
