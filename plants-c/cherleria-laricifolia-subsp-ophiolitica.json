    "intro": "Cherleria laricifolia subsp. ophiolitica, commonly known as the rock pineleaf, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude environments. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, arid conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions with limited nutrient availability. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a distinctive aromatic scent that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat degradation."
