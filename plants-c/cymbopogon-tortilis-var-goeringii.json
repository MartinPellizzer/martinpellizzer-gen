    "intro": "Cymbopogon tortilis var. goeringii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lemon grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its essential oils, rich in citral and other terpenes, contribute to its aromatic properties. This variety is closely related to other lemon grass species but is distinguished by its unique morphological features and chemical composition."
