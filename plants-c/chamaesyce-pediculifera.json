It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, pale green leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters at the ends of stems. Chamaesyce pediculifera is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
