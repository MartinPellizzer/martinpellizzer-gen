    "intro": "Castilleja angustifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It possesses specialized roots that attach to the roots of other plants, allowing it to absorb water and nutrients from its host. The plant features showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it often grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. This species plays a role in pollination and is an important component of its ecosystem."
