It is characterized by its pale green, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by spherical, red berries that are edible for some animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative climbing plant. Its unique foliage and adaptability to various climates make it an interesting addition to botanical collections."
