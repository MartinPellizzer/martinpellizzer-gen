It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, blue to purple flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its widespread distribution. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads."
