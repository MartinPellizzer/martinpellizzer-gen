    "intro": "Cactus glaucus, commonly known as the blue agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in drought conditions. The plant produces striking blue-green leaves that are often coated with a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its flowers, which appear in clusters at the top of the plant, are typically white or pale purple. Cactus glaucus is also valued for its sap, which is used in the production of agave-based products like tequila and soda."
