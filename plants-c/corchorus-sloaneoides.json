    "intro": "Corchorus sloaneoides, commonly known as the swampmallow, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in wet, marshy environments and has large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous stems and leaves have been used historically for their mucilage, which has medicinal properties. Corchorus sloaneoides is valued both for its ecological role and its potential in traditional herbal medicine."
