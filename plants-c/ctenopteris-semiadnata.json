    "intro": "Ctenopteris semiadnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea palm, is a species of fern native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, saline environments and is often found growing on rocky shores or in tidal zones. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its fronds provide a habitat for various small marine organisms. The plant plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and supporting biodiversity."
