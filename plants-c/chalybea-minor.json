    "intro": "Chalybea minor, commonly known as the small ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in wetland areas and has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Chalybea minor is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
