    "intro": "Cheilanthes microphylla var. elongata, commonly known as the slender cliff brake, is a terrestrial fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered near the margins. This variety is notable for its drought tolerance and ability to colonize exposed rock surfaces."
