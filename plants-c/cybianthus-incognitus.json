    "intro": "Cybianthus incognitus, commonly known as the unknown cybianthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring. Cybianthus incognitus is notable for its limited distribution and is considered endangered due to habitat loss and environmental changes. Its botanical study is important for understanding biodiversity in high-altitude ecosystems."
