    "intro": "Coronilla ramosissima, commonly known as the Spanish broom, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, trifoliate leaves and produces elongated pods that contain several seeds. Native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, it thrives in dry, sunny environments. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
