    "intro": "Coluteastrum glabratum, commonly known as the smooth colutea, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and southern Europe. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves contribute to its common name, and it is often found in disturbed or arid environments. The seeds are enclosed in pods and can be dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across suitable habitats."
