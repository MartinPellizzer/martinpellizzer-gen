    "intro": "Canna amabilis, commonly known as the sweet canna, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, colorful, sword-shaped leaves and showy, spathaceous flowers that come in shades of red, orange, yellow, and pink. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 meters, with a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense clumps. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Canna amabilis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage and floral display."
