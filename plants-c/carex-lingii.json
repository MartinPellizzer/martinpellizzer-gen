    "intro": "Carex lingii, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes, which are followed by three-sided, spiky fruits. Carex lingii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
