It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive rhomboidal shape and bright green, glossy foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in stream banks and pond margins. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for aquatic insects and its ecological value in wetland habitats."
