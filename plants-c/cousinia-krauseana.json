    "intro": "Cousinia krauseana, commonly known as the Kashmir wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is well adapted to cold, arid environments. It is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters. Cousinia krauseana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
