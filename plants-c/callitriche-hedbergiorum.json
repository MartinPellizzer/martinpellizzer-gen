It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has tiny, star-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the water's surface. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in early spring. Callitriche hedbergiorum plays a role in supporting aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates."
