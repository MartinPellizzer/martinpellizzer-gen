    "intro": "Catakidozamia macleayi, commonly known as the Macleay's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the subtropical rainforests of northeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in moist, well-drained soils under shaded conditions. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Catakidozamia macleayi is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
