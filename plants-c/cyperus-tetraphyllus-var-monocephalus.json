    "intro": "Cyperus tetraphyllus var. monocephalus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a species of flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, preferring full sun to partial shade. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense stands. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
