    "intro": "Crepis runcinata subsp. imbricata, commonly known as the narrowleaf hawk's-beard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and basal leaves that are linear to narrowly elliptic in shape. The plant produces bright yellow composite flowers with ray florets and a central disk, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its small, oval seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
