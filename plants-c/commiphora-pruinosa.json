    "intro": "Commiphora pruinosa, commonly known as the silky commiphora, is a small, deciduous shrub native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by dark brown, resinous capsules that exude a fragrant, aromatic gum. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands. Due to its unique appearance and medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and traditional medicine practitioners alike."
