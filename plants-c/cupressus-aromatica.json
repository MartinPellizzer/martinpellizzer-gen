    "intro": "Cupressus aromatica, commonly known as the Aleppo cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its aromatic wood has been historically used in construction and as a source of essential oils. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
