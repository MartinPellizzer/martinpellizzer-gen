    "intro": "Ctenolophon philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine ctenolophon, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish-white flowers, which are typically followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
