    "intro": "Cyperus afromontanus, commonly known as the East African flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Cyperus afromontanus is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
