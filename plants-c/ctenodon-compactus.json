    "intro": "Ctenodon compactus, commonly known as the dense-hair grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features dense, compact growth with short, stiff leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Ctenodon compactus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
