    "intro": "Cyclosorus stokesii, commonly known as Stokes' cyclosorus, is a rare and delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, intricately divided fronds that form a dense, compact rosette. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus stokesii is considered a species of conservation concern."
