    "intro": "Connarus popenoei, commonly known as the Popenoe's connarus, is a rare and unusual plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It belongs to the Connaraceae family and is characterized by its unique, palmate leaves that resemble those of a maple tree. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are berries that split open to release seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Connarus popenoei is considered a species of conservation concern."
