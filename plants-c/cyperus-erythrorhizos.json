It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and arranged in a triangular cross-section. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its roots are distinctive, often appearing reddish due to the presence of certain pigments. Cyperus erythrorhizos is adapted to wet or marshy environments, making it a common species in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
