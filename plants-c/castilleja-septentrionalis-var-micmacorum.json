    "intro": "Castilleja septentrionalis var. micmacorum, commonly known as the Micmac milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a slender, erect stem with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil. This species is adapted to dry, open habitats such as sandy soils and forest edges."
