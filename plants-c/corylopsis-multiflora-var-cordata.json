    "intro": "Corylopsis multiflora var. cordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf goldthread, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically 2\u20134 inches long and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, bell-shaped flowers in late winter to early spring, which are highly fragrant and attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in colder climates for its early blooming habit."
