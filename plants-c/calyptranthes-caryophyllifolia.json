    "intro": "Calyptranthes caryophyllifolia, commonly known as the scarlet mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of red, fleshy berries. The plant attaches itself to host trees, such as those in the genus *Inga*, through haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host. Its flowers are typically white or pink and are arranged in dense, terminal clusters. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance and ecological interactions."
