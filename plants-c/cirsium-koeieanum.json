It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
