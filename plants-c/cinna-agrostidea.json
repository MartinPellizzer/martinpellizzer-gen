    "intro": "Cinna agrostidea, commonly known as the slender cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by distinctive, five-lobed seed capsules. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its common name. Cinna agrostidea is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
