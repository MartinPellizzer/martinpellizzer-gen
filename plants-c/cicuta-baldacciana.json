    "intro": "Cicuta baldacciana, commonly known as the Baldaccian water hemlock, is a toxic member of the Apiaceae family. It is native to the northern regions of the Americas and thrives in wet, marshy habitats. The plant is characterized by its smooth, hollow stems and compound leaves with finely divided foliage. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. Due to its highly poisonous nature, it is often considered one of the most dangerous plants in its native range."
