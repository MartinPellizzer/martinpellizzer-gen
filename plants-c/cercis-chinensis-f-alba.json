It is characterized by its striking white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The tree has a rounded crown and smooth, greyish bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip. This ornamental tree is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its spring blossoms."
