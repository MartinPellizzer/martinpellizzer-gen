    "intro": "Capparis stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed caper, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, tangy fruits. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, and the plant is known for its hardy, drought-resistant nature. Capparis stenophylla is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in traditional medicine."
