    "intro": "Cavendishia santafeensis, commonly known as the Santa Fe cactus, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems and clusters of vibrant yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cavendishia santafeensis is considered endangered in the wild."
