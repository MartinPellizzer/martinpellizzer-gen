    "intro": "Cottendorfia minor, commonly known as the dwarf cottendorfia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows to a height of around 10-20 centimeters, with slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers in the summer months, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Cottendorfia minor is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
