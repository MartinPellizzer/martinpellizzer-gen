    "intro": "Cakile aegyptia var. australis, commonly known as the Australian sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in coastal and inland deserts. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, apple-like fruits. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in its native dry environment. This variety is closely related to other species in the genus Cakile, which are known for their ability to tolerate harsh conditions."
