    "intro": "Cirsium setosum, commonly known as the hispid thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture, while its flowers are arranged in a spherical shape. Cirsium setosum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides."
