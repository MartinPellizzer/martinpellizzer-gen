    "intro": "Cerastium arvense var. maximum, commonly known as the greater mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in meadows. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through stolons make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
