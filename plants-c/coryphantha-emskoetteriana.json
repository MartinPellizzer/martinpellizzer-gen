    "intro": "Coryphantha emskoetteriana, commonly known as the Emskoetter's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a globular or cylindrical shape, often covered in a thick layer of white, waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, edible fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soil. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
