    "intro": "Calathea prolifera, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that often feature intricate patterns and a waxy texture. The plant is known for its ability to close its leaves at night, a behavior called nyctinasty, which is a response to changes in light and temperature. Calathea prolifera thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
