It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, oval fruits that contain seeds with a distinctive, often bitter taste. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
