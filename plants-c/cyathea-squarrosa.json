It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.

The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their aesthetic appeal."
