    "intro": "Cerastium valachicum, commonly known as the valley chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its frost-resistant nature. Cerastium valachicum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
