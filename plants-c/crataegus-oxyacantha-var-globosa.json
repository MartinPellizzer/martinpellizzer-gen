    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha var. globosa, commonly known as the globular hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spherical growth habit and thorny branches, which provide structural support for its showy, white to pink flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its compact form and ornamental value make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
