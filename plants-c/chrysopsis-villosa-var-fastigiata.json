    "intro": "Chrysopsis villosa var. fastigiata, commonly known as the woolly goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its upright, narrow growth habit makes it an attractive addition to native plant gardens. It plays a valuable role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
