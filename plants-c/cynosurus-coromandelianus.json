    "intro": "Cynosurus coromandelianus, commonly known as the Coromandel sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats, thriving in environments with high humidity. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. Cynosurus coromandelianus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
