It features heart-shaped leaves with a deep green color and produces striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is characterized by its tuberous roots, which store nutrients and help it survive in wetland or marshy environments. It thrives in moist, sunny conditions and is often found in swampy areas or near water bodies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and wetland restoration projects."
