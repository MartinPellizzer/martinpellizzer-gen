    "intro": "Coffea liberica var. dewevrei, commonly known as the West African Liberica, is a rare and less commonly cultivated variant of the Liberica coffee species. It is native to West Africa, particularly found in countries such as Nigeria and Cameroon. The plant is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and can grow up to 15 meters tall in its natural habitat. It produces large, red berries containing two seeds, which are used for coffee production. Due to its limited cultivation and unique flavor profile, it is considered a specialty coffee variety."
