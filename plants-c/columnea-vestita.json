    "intro": "Columnea vestita, commonly known as the silver mist plant, is a striking member of the Gesneriaceae family native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its cascading clusters of tubular, bright red flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant features velvety, dark green leaves with a silvery underside, giving it a distinctive, almost misty appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea vestita is often cultivated as a decorative trailing plant in hanging baskets or as a ground cover in shaded garden areas."
