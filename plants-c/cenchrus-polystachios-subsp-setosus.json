    "intro": "Cenchrus polystachios subsp. setosus, commonly known as the hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the warmer regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, hairy, cylindrical spikelets that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. The species is known for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in arid conditions."
