It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and have a slightly waxy coating. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, three-ranked flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
