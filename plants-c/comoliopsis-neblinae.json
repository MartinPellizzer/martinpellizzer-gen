    "intro": "Comoliopsis neblinae, commonly known as the misty orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and striking, fragrant white and purple flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires specific humidity levels to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected natural reserves. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
