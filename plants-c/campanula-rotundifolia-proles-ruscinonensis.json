It is characterized by its round, heart-shaped leaves and bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value.
