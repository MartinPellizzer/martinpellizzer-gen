    "intro": "Carex festiva var. viridis, commonly known as the green festive sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its dense growth habit makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat creation for wildlife."
