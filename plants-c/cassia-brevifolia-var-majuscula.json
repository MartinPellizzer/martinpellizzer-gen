    "intro": "Cassia brevifolia var. majuscula, commonly known as the giant sicklepod, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features compound leaves with elongated, sickle-shaped leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense spikes, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
