    "intro": "Convolvulus bibracteatus, commonly known as the two-bracted morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its vine-like growth habit and trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning. The plant produces small, two-lobed bracts at the base of its leaves, which are a distinguishing feature. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid regions. Its flowers are typically pale blue to purple in color, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
