    "intro": "Chenopodium \u00d7 striatialbum, commonly known as the hybrid goosefoot, is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Chenopodium album (common goosefoot) and Chenopodium rigidum (prickly goosefoot). The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture. Its inflorescence consists of small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters. The species is often found in temperate regions and is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
