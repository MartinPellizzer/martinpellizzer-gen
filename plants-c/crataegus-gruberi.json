    "intro": "Crataegus gruberi, commonly known as the Gruber\u2019s hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to elliptic leaves, and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Crataegus gruberi is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
