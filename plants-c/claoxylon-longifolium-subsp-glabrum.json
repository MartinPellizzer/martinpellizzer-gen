    "intro": "Claoxylon longifolium subsp. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved claoxylon, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its simple, lanceolate leaves that are typically glabrous or nearly hairless. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its bark is thick and fissured, often with a rough texture. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental potential and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
