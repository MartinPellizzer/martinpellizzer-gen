It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its clumping growth habit and slender, hollow stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and mountainous areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it blend into its natural habitat.
