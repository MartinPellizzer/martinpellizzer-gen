    "intro": "Centaurea praetermissa, commonly known as the common centaury, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Its bright blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, and it produces bristly, spiny seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. The leaves are grass-like and often have a slight hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
