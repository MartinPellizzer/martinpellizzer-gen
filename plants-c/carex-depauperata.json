    "intro": "Carex depauperata, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and swampy areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. Its flowering spikes are usually small and inconspicuous, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex depauperata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
