    "intro": "Colubrina humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by distinctive, violet-blue berries that ripen in the fall. These berries are not only ornamental but also attract birds and other wildlife, contributing to the plant's ecological value. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a versatile choice for landscaping in USDA hardiness zones 6 through 9."
