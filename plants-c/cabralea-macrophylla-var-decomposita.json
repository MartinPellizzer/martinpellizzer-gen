    "intro": "Cabralea macrophylla var. decomposita, commonly known as the decomposed cabralea, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the rainy season. Its growth habit is shrub-like, with a woody stem and a tendency to form dense thickets in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species within its ecological niche."
