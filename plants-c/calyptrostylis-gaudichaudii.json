    "intro": "Calyptrostylis gaudichaudii, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, such as rimu and kahikatea, through specialized structures called haustoria. It produces small, red berries that are an important food source for native birds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some areas."
