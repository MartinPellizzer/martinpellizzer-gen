    "intro": "Cactus pentacanthus, commonly known as the giant cardon cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to the Sonoran Desert in North America. It is one of the tallest cacti, capable of reaching heights up to 20 meters. Its stem is thick and ribbed, adapted to store water and withstand extreme temperatures. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bats and insects. Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a keystone species in its habitat."
