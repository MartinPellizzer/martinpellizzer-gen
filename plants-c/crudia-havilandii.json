    "intro": "Crudia havilandii, commonly known as the Haviland's wild indigo, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits and compound leaves. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value. Crudia havilandii is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its historical use in traditional medicine."
