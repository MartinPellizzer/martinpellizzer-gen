    "intro": "Conomitra, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow and are borne in clusters. Conomitra species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They are often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, where they thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
