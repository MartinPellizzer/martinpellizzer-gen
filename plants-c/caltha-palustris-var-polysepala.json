    "intro": "Caltha palustris var. polysepala, commonly known as the marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has smooth, glossy, dark green leaves that are arrowhead-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette. Its stems are slender and often tinged with red, and it produces numerous small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This variety is distinguished by its numerous sepals, which are more prominent than in the typical form of the species."
