    "intro": "Calyptridium, commonly known as the mountain daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in spring. Calyptridium species are often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in arid or semi-arid environments. They have hairy leaves and produce small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Some species are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens due to their vibrant colors and compact growth habit."
