    "intro": "Carex lutchuensis, commonly known as Lutchuensis sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly the island of Borneo. This perennial plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it forms dense clumps of grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish itself in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
