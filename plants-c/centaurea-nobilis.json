    "intro": "Centaurea nobilis, commonly known as the noble centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and spiny, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. It produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across arid regions. Centaurea nobilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
