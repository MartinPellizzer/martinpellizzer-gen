    "intro": "Chamaecytisus spinescens var. ramosissimus, commonly known as the creeping rose bush, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves and a woody stem that is often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a hedge. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to produce clusters of berries that persist into winter."
