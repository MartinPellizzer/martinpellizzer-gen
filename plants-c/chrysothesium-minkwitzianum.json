    "intro": "Chrysothesium minkwitzianum, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and sepals that form a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers bloom during the spring and summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
