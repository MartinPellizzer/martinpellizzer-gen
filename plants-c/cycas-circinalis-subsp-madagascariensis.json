    "intro": "Cycas circinalis subsp. madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically growing on separate plants. It is native to Madagascar and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
