    "intro": "Calamagrostis autumnalis var. virens, commonly known as the green fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It features slender, upright stems that produce dense, grass-like foliage with a bright green hue. The plant produces fluffy, silver-white plumes in the autumn, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens, borders, and as a ground cover."
