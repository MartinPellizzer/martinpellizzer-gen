    "intro": "Cactus divaricatus, commonly known as the zigzag cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, angular stems that form a zigzag pattern, which helps reduce water loss by minimizing surface area exposed to the sun. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green, spiny structure. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Cactus divaricatus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
