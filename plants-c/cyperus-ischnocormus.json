    "intro": "Cyperus ischnocormus, commonly known as the narrow-corm sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats, where it thrives in shallow water or saturated soil. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Cyperus ischnocormus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
