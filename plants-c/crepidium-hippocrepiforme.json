    "intro": "Crepidium hippocrepiforme, commonly known as the horse chestnut orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, pale green to yellowish flowers that resemble those of the horse chestnut tree, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, short flower spike with several blooms. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
