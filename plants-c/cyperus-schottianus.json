    "intro": "Cyperus schottianus, commonly known as the Schott's flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its roots are often rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Cyperus schottianus is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to various water conditions."
