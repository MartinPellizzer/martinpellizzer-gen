It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by the wind.
