    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe duckei, commonly known as the ducke's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, providing structural support and facilitating nutrient absorption. The fronds are typically green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
