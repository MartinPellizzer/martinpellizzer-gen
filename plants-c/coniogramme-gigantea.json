    "intro": "Coniogramme gigantea, commonly known as the giant fern, is a striking member of the Blechnaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. This plant is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with finely divided segments that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks."
