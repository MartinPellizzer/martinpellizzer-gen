    "intro": "Campylotropis gracilis, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Campylotropis gracilis plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria."
