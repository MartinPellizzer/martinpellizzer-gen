    "intro": "Cnicus wheeleri, commonly known as Wheeler's sow thistle, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of spiny, lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in some areas but also has ecological value in supporting local wildlife."
