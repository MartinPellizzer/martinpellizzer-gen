    "intro": "Conchidium microchilos, commonly known as the small-chilus orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, finely veined leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a subtle purple tinge. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
