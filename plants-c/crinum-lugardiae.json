It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in coastal and sandy soils. The plant features large, showy white or pale purple flowers that bloom in summer, often with a strong, spicy fragrance. Its leaves are broad, strap-like, and arranged in a fan shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Crinum lugardiae is often cultivated for its beauty and resilience, though it can be toxic to animals and humans."
