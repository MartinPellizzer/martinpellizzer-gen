    "intro": "Campanula kryophila, commonly known as the snow bell, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its foliage consists of basal leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Campanula kryophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
