    "intro": "Caladenia major, commonly known as the large spider orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, intricately patterned flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing vibrant pink or purple flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip. Caladenia major prefers sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and grasslands. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it a notable species in Australian flora."
