It features a sturdy, upright stem covered in coarse, grayish-green hairy foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a dense, flat-topped cluster, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often have a bluish or purplish hue due to a waxy coating.
