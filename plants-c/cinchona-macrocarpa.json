    "intro": "Cinchona macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental, palm-like appearance with large, glossy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is valued for its medicinal properties, as it is a source of quinine, historically used in the treatment of malaria. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
