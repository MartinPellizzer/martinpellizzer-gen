It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
