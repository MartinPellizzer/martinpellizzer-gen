    "intro": "Cyathula prostrata var. debilis, commonly known as the slender spurge, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in cyathia, which are cup-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant has alternate, simple leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
