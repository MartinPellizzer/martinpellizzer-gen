    "intro": "Carduus rivularis, commonly known as water thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist environments such as stream banks, marshes, and wet meadows. The plant features a tall, sturdy stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, and it produces striking purple to pink composite flower heads. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, while the roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine. The plant is also known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting pollinator populations."
