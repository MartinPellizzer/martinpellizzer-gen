    "intro": "Cheiranthus hispidus, commonly known as the hispid wallflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste grounds. Its flowers are usually bright yellow or orange, with four petals arranged in a cross shape, a characteristic feature of the Brassicaceae family. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
