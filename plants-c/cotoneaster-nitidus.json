    "intro": "Cotoneaster nitidus, commonly known as the glossy cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, providing an attractive appearance in both spring and autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in a variety of soil types. Cotoneaster nitidus is also valued for its ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade conditions."
