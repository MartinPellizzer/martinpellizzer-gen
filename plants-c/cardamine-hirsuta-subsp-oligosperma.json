    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta subsp. oligosperma, commonly known as the hairy watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has small, trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture, and it produces clusters of tiny white to pale yellow flowers. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it is known for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress. The subspecies is distinguished by its reduced number of seeds compared to the typical form of Cardamine hirsuta."
