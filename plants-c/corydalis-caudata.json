    "intro": "Corydalis caudata, commonly known as the trailing corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and clusters of small, delicate flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release its seeds, a feature typical of the Fumariaceae family. Corydalis caudata thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period, which extends from spring to early summer."
