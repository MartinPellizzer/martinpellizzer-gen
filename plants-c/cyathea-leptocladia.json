It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant features a tall, unbranched trunk with a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. Its rhizome is thick and produces numerous roots that help anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil. Cyathea leptocladia is often found in moist, shaded forest environments, where it thrives in humid and nutrient-rich conditions."
