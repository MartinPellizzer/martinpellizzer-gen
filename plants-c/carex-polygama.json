    "intro": "Carex polygama, commonly known as the common sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with triangular stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Carex polygama plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
