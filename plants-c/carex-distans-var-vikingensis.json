    "intro": "Carex distans var. vikingensis, commonly known as the Viking sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often found in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing soil."
