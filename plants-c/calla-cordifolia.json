It features striking, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically heart-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces elegant, white spathified flowers that are often surrounded by a showy, leaf-like bract. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Calla cordifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable water conditions."
