    "intro": "Conyza rufa, commonly known as roughleaf sandbur, is a flowering plant native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is an annual herb that grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and roadsides. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and its yellow flowers are arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It produces small, spiny fruits called burrs, which can attach to clothing or animal fur. Conyza rufa is often considered a weed but has ecological significance in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil."
