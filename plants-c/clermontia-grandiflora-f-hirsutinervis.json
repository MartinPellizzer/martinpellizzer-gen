    "intro": "Clermontia grandiflora f. hirsutinervis, commonly known as the hairy-veined Clermontia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Hawaii. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy white or pink flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy veins, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and invasive species."
