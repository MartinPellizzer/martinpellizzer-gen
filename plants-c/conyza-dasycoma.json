    "intro": "Conyza dasycoma, commonly known as roughleaf fleabane, is an annual herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-white composite flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is characterized by its robust growth and ability to thrive in poor soils, making it a common weed in disturbed areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Conyza dasycoma is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields."
