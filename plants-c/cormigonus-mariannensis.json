    "intro": "Cormigonus mariannensis, commonly known as the Mariana corm, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of the Mariana Islands. It is characterized by its underground corm, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients and water. The plant produces striking, colorful flowers that bloom above the soil surface, often in clusters. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, coastal habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
