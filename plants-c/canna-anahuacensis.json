    "intro": "Canna anahuacensis, commonly known as the Mexican canna, is a striking ornamental plant native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, often with a distinctive purple or reddish hue on the underside. The plant produces tall, slender stalks topped with clusters of bright orange or red flowers, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for wetland gardens or pond edges. Canna anahuacensis is valued for its dramatic appearance and ability to add color and texture to aquatic or bog landscapes."
