    "intro": "Cereus hondurensis, commonly known as the Honduran candleplant, is a cactus native to Central America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, a trait common among many nocturnal flowering plants. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted for storing water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The leaves are reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss and provide some protection from herbivores."
