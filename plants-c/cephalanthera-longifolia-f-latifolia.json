    "intro": "Cephalanthera longifolia f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its distinctive, fragrant, and sparsely branched inflorescence. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces flowers in a loose, spiraled arrangement, typically in shades of white to pale pink. The plant is native to moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, humusy soils. It is a perennial herb that blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often protected in its native range."
