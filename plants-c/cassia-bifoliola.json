    "intro": "Cassia bifoliola, commonly known as the two-leaved cassia, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which are bipinnate, meaning they have two sets of small leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods and are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Cassia bifoliola is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
