    "intro": "Cleretum, commonly known as the marsh woundwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. It typically features hairy, succulent leaves and produces clusters of small, blue or purple flowers. The plant is often found in wet or marshy environments, thriving in moist soil conditions. Cleretum species are perennial herbs that can spread via rhizomes, forming dense mats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to wetland habitats, though it can be invasive in some regions."
