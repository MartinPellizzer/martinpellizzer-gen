    "intro": "Carex suberecta, commonly known as the upright sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in a cylindrical inflorescence. Carex suberecta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
