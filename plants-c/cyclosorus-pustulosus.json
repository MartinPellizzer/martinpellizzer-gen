    "intro": "Cyclosorus pustulosus, commonly known as the hairy cyclosorus, is a species of aquatic fern native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are covered in small, rounded tubercles, giving it a distinctive, hairy appearance. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Cyclosorus pustulosus plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for microorganisms."
