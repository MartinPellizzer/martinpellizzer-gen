    "intro": "Cynoglossum officinale var. scabrifolia, commonly known as hairy mouse-ear, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
