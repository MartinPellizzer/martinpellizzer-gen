It features fleshy, tuberous roots and stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white, tubular flowers that attract specific pollinators, such as moths. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, silky hairs. Ceropegia caffra is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability."
