    "intro": "Catabrosa helodes, commonly known as the golden bellvista, is a striking member of the Malvaceae family. It is native to the Andes mountains of South America, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant is characterized by its large, velvety leaves and showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and specialized collections. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
