    "intro": "Caucalis coniifolia, commonly known as the mouse-ear hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its stems are often reddish in color. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Caucalis coniifolia is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
