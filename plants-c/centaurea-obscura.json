    "intro": "Centaurea obscura, commonly known as the dark centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Centaurea obscura is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
