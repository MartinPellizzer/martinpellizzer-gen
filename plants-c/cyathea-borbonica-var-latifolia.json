    "intro": "Cyathea borbonica var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf tree fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes produce new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants in tropical gardens."
