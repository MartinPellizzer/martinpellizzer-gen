    "intro": "Campylanthus somaliensis, commonly known as the Somali campanula, is a flowering plant native to the Horn of Africa. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
