    "intro": "Cissus mollis, commonly known as the rock fig or stone plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in small, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments and can thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Cissus mollis is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and ability to trail from containers or rockeries."
