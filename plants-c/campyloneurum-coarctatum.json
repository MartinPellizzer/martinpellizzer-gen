It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and ecological preferences make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
