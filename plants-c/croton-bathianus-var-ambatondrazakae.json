    "intro": "Croton bathianus var. ambatondrazakae, commonly known as the Ambatondrazaka croton, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage with vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
