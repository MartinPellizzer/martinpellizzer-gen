It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves with a leathery texture. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing single seeds. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
