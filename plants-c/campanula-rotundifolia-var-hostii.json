    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia var. hostii, commonly known as the Host's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rounded, often hairy leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
