    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe dewildei, commonly known as the dwarf crocodile fern, is a rare and unique epiphytic fern native to the humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and distinctive, crocodile-like leaf patterns. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches. Its fronds are leathery and have a complex, divided structure with a striking appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate species requiring careful conservation efforts."
