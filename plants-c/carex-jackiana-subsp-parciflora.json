    "intro": "Carex jackiana subsp. parciflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically bright green and slightly glossy. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish-green flowers, which are often borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along stream edges. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
