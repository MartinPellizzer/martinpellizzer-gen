    "intro": "Carex echinata var. gypsos, commonly known as the gypsum sedge, is a variant of the common sedge species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. This plant thrives in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or gypsum-rich environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. The plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping."
