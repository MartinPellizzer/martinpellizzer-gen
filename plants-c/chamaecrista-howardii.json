    "intro": "Chamaecrista howardii, commonly known as the scarlet bird's eye, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that resemble small eyes, which are clustered in dense spikes. The plant has trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Chamaecrista howardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
