    "intro": "Cheilanthes tenuifolia f. gracilior, commonly known as the slender cliff brake, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant is epiphytic, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in arid or semi-arid environments. Its fronds are usually pale green and have a finely toothed margin. This fern is well adapted to drought conditions, with a thick, waxy cuticle that reduces water loss."
