    "intro": "Calamagrostis gracilis, commonly known as slender sweetgrass, is a perennial grass native to wetland and marshy areas of North America. It features slender, arching stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or white along the edges. The plant produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, releasing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats. Calamagrostis gracilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional use by Indigenous peoples in crafting and ceremonial practices."
