    "intro": "Cypella wolffhuegelii, commonly known as the Wolffhuegel's cypella, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its unique leaf morphology and floral structure. Native to the mountainous regions of South America, it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, umbel-like clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, which is typical for many members of its family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cypella wolffhuegelii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
