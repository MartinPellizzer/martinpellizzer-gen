    "intro": "Caesalpinia pectinata, commonly known as the yellow flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange inflorescences that resemble flames, which bloom during the dry season. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its bark is often covered in a rough, fissured texture. Caesalpinia pectinata produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
