    "intro": "Cynometra elmeri, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and long, narrow leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by round, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in dry to moist tropical climates and is often found in savanna and woodland ecosystems. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
