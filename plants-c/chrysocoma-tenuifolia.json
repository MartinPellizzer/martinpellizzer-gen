    "intro": "Chrysocoma tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chrysocoma, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
