    "intro": "Cheilanthes papuana, commonly known as the Papuan rock fern, is a terrestrial fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Papua New Guinea. The plant is characterized by its short, compact rhizome and dense, evergreen fronds that are typically leathery in texture. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, with spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds. Cheilanthes papuana thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments."
