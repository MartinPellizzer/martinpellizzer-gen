It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, and its fruit is a three-lobed capsule containing small seeds. It is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance and potential medicinal properties. The silky tree is also noted for its ability to thrive in tropical climates with high humidity."
