It features showy, bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
