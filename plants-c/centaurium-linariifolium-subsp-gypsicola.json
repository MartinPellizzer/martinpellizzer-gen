    "intro": "Centaurium linariifolium subsp. gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum centaury, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The subspecies is adapted to grow in calcium-rich soils, particularly on gypsum outcrops, which influence its unique morphology and chemical composition. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soils in its harsh habitat and is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic adaptations."
