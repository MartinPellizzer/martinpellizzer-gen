    "intro": "Cyperus ochrocephalus, commonly known as the yellow-headed flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, with the inflorescence often appearing yellowish due to the color of the bracts. Cyperus ochrocephalus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
