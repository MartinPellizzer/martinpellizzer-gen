    "intro": "Cuphea petalosa, commonly known as the flamebeard plant, is a flowering plant native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that resemble tiny flames, which are particularly attractive to hummingbirds. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it typically grows as an annual or short-lived perennial. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Cuphea petalosa is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
