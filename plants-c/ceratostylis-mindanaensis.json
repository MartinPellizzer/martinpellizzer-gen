    "intro": "Ceratostylis mindanaensis, commonly known as the Mindanao horned orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive horn-like structure on the lip, which is a notable botanical feature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
