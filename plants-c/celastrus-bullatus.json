    "intro": "Celastrus bullatus, commonly known as the red-berried celastros, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. Its berries are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Celastrus bullatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
