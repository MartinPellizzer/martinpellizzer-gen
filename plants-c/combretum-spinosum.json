    "intro": "Combretum spinosum, commonly known as the spiny combretum, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, spiny stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
