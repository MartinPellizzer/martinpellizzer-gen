    "intro": "Crataegus sarniensis, commonly known as the Sarnian hawthorn, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family. It is native to central and eastern Europe, where it typically grows in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant is characterized by its thorny branches, oval leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that appear in spring. It produces small, red berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. The Sarnian hawthorn is valued for its ecological role in supporting wildlife and its historical use in traditional medicine."
