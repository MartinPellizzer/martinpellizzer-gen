    "intro": "Chrozophora senegalensis, commonly known as the Senegalese goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to Africa, particularly found in countries like Senegal, Sudan, and Somalia. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 1 meter in height, with slender stems and alternate leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are enclosed in capsules that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Chrozophora senegalensis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
