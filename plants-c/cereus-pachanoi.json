    "intro": "Cereus pachanoi, commonly known as the night bloomer or Jesus Christ cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a columnar cactus with a thick, ribbed stem that can grow up to several meters in height. Its most striking feature is its large, white, night-blooming flowers that open only during the evening. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems and having spines for protection. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for desert gardens."
