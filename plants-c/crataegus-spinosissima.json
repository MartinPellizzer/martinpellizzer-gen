    "intro": "Crataegus spinosissima, commonly known as the spiny hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to ovate leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white to pinkish flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along coastal areas."
