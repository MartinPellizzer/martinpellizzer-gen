    "intro": "Choananthus wollastonii, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
