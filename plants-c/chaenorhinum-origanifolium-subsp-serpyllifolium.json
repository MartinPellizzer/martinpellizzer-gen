    "intro": "Chaenorhinum origanifolium subsp. serpyllifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and calcareous soils in southern Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant. It is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in coastal areas and open fields. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
