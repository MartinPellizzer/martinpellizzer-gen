    "intro": "Chrysosplenium glaberrimum, commonly known as the smooth spongyplant, is a low-growing perennial herb belonging to the Saxifragaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
