    "intro": "Cynoglottis barrelieri subsp. serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine cynoglottis, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in serpentine soils. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant is endemic to specific regions with high levels of heavy metals in the soil, which influences its growth and distribution. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features reflect its unique adaptation to nutrient-poor, metal-rich environments."
