It is characterized by its striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cooler, moist environments. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are erect and branching. Ciliaria austromontana plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for native pollinators."
