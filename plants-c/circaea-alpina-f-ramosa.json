    "intro": "Circaea alpina f. ramosa, commonly known as the alpine twinflower, is a flowering plant belonging to the Primulaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found in rocky or open habitats. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are usually clustered in pairs. This variant is distinguished by its more branched growth habit compared to the typical form of Circaea alpina."
