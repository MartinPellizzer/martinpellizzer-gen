It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, yellowish to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes cultivated in landscaping and restoration projects."
