It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and striking blue-green foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically violet or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean climates."
