It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually golden or brown in hue. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight pubescence on the underside.
