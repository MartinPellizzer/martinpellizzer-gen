    "intro": "Chenopodium album var. viridescens, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is an annual herbaceous plant characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and broad, lobed leaves. It typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in various habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. The leaves are usually covered with fine hairs and have a slightly sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. Its small green flowers are borne in clusters and are wind-pollinated. This plant is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
