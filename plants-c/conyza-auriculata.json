It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that often have a reddish tinge. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from summer to autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Conyza auriculata is also known for its ability to spread through wind-dispersed seeds, making it a common weed in many regions."
