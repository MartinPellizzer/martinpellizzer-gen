    "intro": "Convolvulus medium, commonly known as the common morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its twining stems that climb or trail along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue, purple, or white, opening in the morning and closing in the afternoon. Its leaves are heart-shaped and hairy, while its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Convolvulus medium is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
