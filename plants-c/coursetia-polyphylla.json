    "intro": "Coursetia polyphylla, commonly known as the desert broom. It is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in late spring, adding a splash of color to the desert landscape. Coursetia polyphylla is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
