    "intro": "Cedrela fissilis var. macrocarpa, commonly known as Brazilian walnut or mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, pinnate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing edible seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
