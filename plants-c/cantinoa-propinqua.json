    "intro": "Cantinoa propinqua, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores. Cantinoa propinqua plays a role in supporting specific pollinators and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
