    "intro": "Chenopodium neomexicanum var. palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's goosefoot, is a shrub-like plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. This species is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
