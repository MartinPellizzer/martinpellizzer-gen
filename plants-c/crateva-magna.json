    "intro": "Crateva magna, commonly known as the African nightshade, is a tropical shrub native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically divided into five to seven lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into orange or red berries. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds in their raw form. Crateva magna is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional medicinal uses in some regions."
