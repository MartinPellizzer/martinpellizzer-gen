It is characterized by its small, often inconspicuous flowers and a root system that can be fibrous or tuberous. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands or stream banks. Cryptopodium species are often found in temperate regions and are known for their aromatic leaves. Due to their limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, some species are considered rare or endangered."
