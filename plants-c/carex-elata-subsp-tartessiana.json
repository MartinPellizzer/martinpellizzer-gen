    "intro": "Carex elata subsp. tartessiana, commonly known as the tall sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and grass-like leaves, which are typically dark green and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
