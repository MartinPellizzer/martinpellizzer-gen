    "intro": "Carex muehlenbergii var. xalapensis, commonly known as the Mexican sedge, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
