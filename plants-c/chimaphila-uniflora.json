    "intro": "Chimaphila uniflora, commonly known as the wintergreen or owl's clover, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in acidic, shaded forest environments, often found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, showy white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are evergreen, glossy, and have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its woodland habitat. Chimaphila uniflora is also known for its aromatic leaves, which contain compounds used in traditional herbal remedies."
