    "intro": "Carex nutans f. sulcata, commonly known as the sulcate nodding sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist to wet soils, making it a common sight in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its distinctive sulcate (grooved) leaf surface, which sets it apart from other Carex species."
