    "intro": "Calcitrapa collina, commonly known as the coastal bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are trifoliate, and it produces small, rounded seed pods that contain several seeds. Calcitrapa collina plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various insect species."
