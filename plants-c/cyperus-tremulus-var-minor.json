It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in low-lying areas with poor drainage. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of flowers, which are often pale green or brown. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetlands and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
