    "intro": "Caularthron bivalvatulum, commonly known as the two-valved sea lettuce, is a marine green alga found in coastal regions. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbon-like thallus that resembles a lettuce leaf, hence its common name. The plant has a simple structure with a single layer of cells and lacks true roots, stems, or leaves. It reproduces both sexually and asexually, with the release of gametes and spores into the water. This species plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various organisms."
