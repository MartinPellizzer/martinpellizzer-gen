    "intro": "Cicuta suffruticosa, commonly known as water hemlock, is a highly toxic member of the Apiaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and wetlands. The plant has a slender, branched stem with finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its flowers are small and white, forming umbrella-like clusters called umbels. Due to its potent toxicity, it is considered one of the most dangerous plants in North America."
