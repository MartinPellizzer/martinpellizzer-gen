    "intro": "Casearia oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf casearia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its simple, elliptic to ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, spherical berries that turn red when mature. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its foliage and seasonal fruiting."
