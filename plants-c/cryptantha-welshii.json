    "intro": "Cryptantha welshii, commonly known as Welsh's cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a low, spreading growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the pods that follow the flowers are slender and often hairy. Cryptantha welshii is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
