    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe rectangularis, commonly known as the rectangular fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often rectangular-shaped fronds. The plant's fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitats. It produces small, inconspicuous spore capsules on the underside of its fronds, typical of ferns. Due to its ornamental appearance and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
