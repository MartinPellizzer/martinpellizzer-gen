It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and high-altitude conditions. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in rocky or well-drained soils. Caamembeca andina is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in Andean cultures."
