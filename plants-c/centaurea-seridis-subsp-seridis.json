It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, usually purple or pink flowers arranged in composite heads. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
