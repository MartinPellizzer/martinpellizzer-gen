    "intro": "Casuarina hexagona, commonly known as the narrow-leaf she-oak, is a evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds. Casuarina hexagona is well adapted to coastal environments and can tolerate salt spray and sandy soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
