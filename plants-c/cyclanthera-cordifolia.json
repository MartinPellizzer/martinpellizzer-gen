It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers, squash, and gourds. The plant produces small, green, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers, followed by fruits that are typically green and slightly ribbed. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a trailing growth habit that allows it to climb using tendrils. The plant is often cultivated for its edible fruits, which have a mild, cucumber-like flavor."
