    "intro": "Cocos acaulis var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed coconut palm, is a variant of the coconut palm characterized by its smooth, unbranched stem. It is a tropical plant that thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves and develops coconuts that are typically smaller than those of the common coconut. Its glabrous stem and compact growth habit make it distinct from other coconut varieties. This variant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and resilience."
