    "intro": "Cassytha tasmanica, commonly known as the Tasmanian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Australia. It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using slender, thread-like stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to grow in sandy or disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants if left unchecked."
