    "intro": "Carex extensa var. nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It typically grows in dense clusters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that have distinct parallel veins. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers in the summer, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in moist soils. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
