    "intro": "Caesalpinia modesta, commonly known as the dwarf flame tree, is a small, deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its bright red, flame-like inflorescences that appear during the dry season, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant has bipinnate leaves, which are divided into numerous small leaflets, and its flowers are typically arranged in dense, clustered heads. It produces woody pods that contain several seeds, and the plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Caesalpinia modesta thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
