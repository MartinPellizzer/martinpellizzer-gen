    "intro": "Crepidium graciliscapum, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which are typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
