    "intro": "Critonia heteroneura, commonly known as the narrow-winged orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its unique morphology includes specialized structures that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss, Critonia heteroneura is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
