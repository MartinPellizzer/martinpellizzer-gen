    "intro": "Colea nana, commonly known as dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with a rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise muted appearance. Colea nana thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. It is a hardy species that is well adapted to cold climates and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings."
