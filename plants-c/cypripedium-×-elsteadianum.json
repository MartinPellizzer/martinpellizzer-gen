    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 elsteadianum, commonly known as the Elstead orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium pubescens. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base, which is a typical feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in woodland habitats, preferring moist, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single flower per stem, often in late spring or early summer. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
