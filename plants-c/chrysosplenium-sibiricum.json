It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and is often found growing in rocky or clay soils. Chrysosplenium sibiricum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and delicate floral display."
