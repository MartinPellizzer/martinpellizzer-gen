    "intro": "Corypha palmetto, commonly known as the giant palmetto, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant produces distinctive, spadix-like inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of the Arecaceae family. Its trunk is short and thick, often covered in a fibrous, spongy material. Corypha palmetto is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
