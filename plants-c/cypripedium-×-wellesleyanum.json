    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 wellesleyanum, commonly known as the Wellesley yellow lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to China. It is characterized by its showy, yellow pouch-shaped flower with a green lip, which is typical of the Cypripedium genus. The plant produces a single, large, fragrant flower that blooms in late spring to early summer. It prefers shady, moist woodland habitats and has rhizomatous growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens but is also threatened by habitat loss in the wild."
