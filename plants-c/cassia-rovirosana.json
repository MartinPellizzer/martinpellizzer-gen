    "intro": "Cassia rovirosana, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow, feather-like inflorescences that bloom profusely during the dry season. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into many small leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. Cassia rovirosana is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant flowers and adaptability to various soil types."
