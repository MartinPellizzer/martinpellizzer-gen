    "intro": "Carex paniculata subsp. lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces upright, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in wet or semi-aquatic habitats. The subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of poor soil conditions and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
