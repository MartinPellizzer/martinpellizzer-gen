    "intro": "Croton cooperi, commonly known as the Hawaiian croton, is a tropical shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage, with leaves that can range from green to red, yellow, and orange. The plant has simple, alternate leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by three-lobed, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its restricted native range, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
