    "intro": "Chimaphila umbellata subsp. umbellata, commonly known as the white root or partridgeberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels. These flowers give way to red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in acidic, moist soils and is often found in shaded forest understories."
