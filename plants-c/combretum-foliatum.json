It typically grows to a height of 2\u20136 meters and has opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually smooth and dark green on top. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow or white, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodland or savanna habitats. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties."
