It is characterized by its dark green, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces smooth, elongated fruits that turn from green to yellow as they mature. Its stems are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive texture.
