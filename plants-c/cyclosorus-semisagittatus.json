    "intro": "Cyclosorus semisagittatus, commonly known as the narrow-sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, sword-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, and prefers shaded, moist conditions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is notable for its delicate appearance and is often used in ornamental water gardens."
