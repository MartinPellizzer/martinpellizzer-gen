    "intro": "Cephalanthera cucullata subsp. epipactoides, commonly known as the hooded greenhood, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its unique greenish-yellow flowers that resemble a hood, giving it its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, showy flower per stem. This subspecies is often found in shaded, humid environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
