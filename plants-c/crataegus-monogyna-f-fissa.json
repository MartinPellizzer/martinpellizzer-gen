    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna f. fissa, commonly known as the fissured hawthorn, is a botanical variant of the common hawthorn. It is characterized by its distinctive fissured or split bark, which gives it a unique appearance. This plant typically grows in woodland edges and open habitats, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, white flowers in spring followed by red berries in autumn. The fissured form is a natural variation that adds to the diversity within the Crataegus genus."
