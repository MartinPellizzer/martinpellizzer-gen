    "intro": "Carex vulpina f. elongata, commonly known as the long-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically longer than those of the typical Carex vulpina, giving it its distinguishing appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale to greenish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in riparian zones or along the edges of ponds. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
