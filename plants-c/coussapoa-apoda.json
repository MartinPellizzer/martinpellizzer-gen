    "intro": "Coussapoa apoda, commonly known as the leafless corymbia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, smooth, greyish bark and lack of leaves on its lower trunk. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in corymbs, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a notable species in Australian botanical studies."
