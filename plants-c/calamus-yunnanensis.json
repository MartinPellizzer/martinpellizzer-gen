    "intro": "Calamus yunnanensis, commonly known as Yunnan calamus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to China, particularly the Yunnan province, and is characterized by its long, slender rhizomes and compound leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, a common feature among arum family members. Calamus yunnanensis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies in its role within the diverse flora of Southeast Asia."
