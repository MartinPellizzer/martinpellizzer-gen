    "intro": "Cycas pectinata var. elongata, commonly known as the long-leaf cycas, is a cycad species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically appearing on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
