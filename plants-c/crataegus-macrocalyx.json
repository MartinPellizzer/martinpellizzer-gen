    "intro": "Crataegus macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for wildlife. Its leaves are typically oval with serrated edges and turn yellow in autumn. Crataegus macrocalyx is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along streambanks, thriving in partial to full shade."
