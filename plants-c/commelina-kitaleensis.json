It belongs to the Commelinaceae family, which includes a variety of grass-like and herbaceous plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, blue or violet flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.
