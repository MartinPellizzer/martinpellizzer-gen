    "intro": "Chrysothamnus stenolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, golden-yellow foliage and is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae). The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky slopes and dry plains. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates. The flowers, which appear in late summer, are small and clustered, contributing to its ornamental value in landscaping."
