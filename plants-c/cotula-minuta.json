    "intro": "Cotula minuta, commonly known as the dwarf daisy, is a small flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its tiny, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and bright yellow disc flowers surrounded by white ray florets. Cotula minuta thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. It is also known for its medicinal properties, used traditionally in some African cultures for its calming effects."
