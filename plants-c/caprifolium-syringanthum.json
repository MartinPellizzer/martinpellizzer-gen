    "intro": "Caprifolium syringanthum, commonly known as the sweet woodruff, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, heart-shaped leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves emit a pleasant, vanilla-like scent when crushed, which has made it popular in herbal teas and perfumes. Caprifolium syringanthum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
