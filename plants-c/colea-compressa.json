    "intro": "Colea compressa, commonly known as the compressed colea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is native to the southern regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. The plant is characterized by its slender, compressed stems and small, clustered umbels of white or pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Colea compressa is considered a rare and endangered species."
