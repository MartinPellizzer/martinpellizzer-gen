    "intro": "Calamus riparius, commonly known as the river reed, is a perennial plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands along riverbanks and marshes. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Calamus riparius is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic life and its historical use in basket-making."
