    "intro": "Campanula betulifolia, commonly known as the birchleaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are finely divided and resemble those of birch trees, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
