    "intro": "Cochlearia glaucophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern and western Australia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. This species is adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
