    "intro": "Cosmos reptans, commonly known as the creeping cosmos, is a species of flowering plant native to Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that features slender, trailing stems and produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Its foliage is covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cosmos reptans is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
