    "intro": "Chimonanthus zhejiangensis, commonly known as the Zhejiang winter jasmine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern China. It is characterized by its fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, before the leaves emerge. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are clustered in racemes and emit a strong, sweet scent, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit and visual appeal."
