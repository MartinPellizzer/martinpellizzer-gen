    "intro": "Crocodilodes scolymodes, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant has showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, attracting pollinators such as beetles and bats. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. The plant plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water bodies."
