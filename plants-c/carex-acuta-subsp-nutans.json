It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds or streams. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting wetland biodiversity."
