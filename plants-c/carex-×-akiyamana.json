    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 akiyamana, commonly known as the Japanese sedge, is a hybrid plant in the Carex genus, native to Japan. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in shaded to partially shaded environments. The plant produces dense clusters of grass-like leaves and spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wetland or boggy conditions. Carex \u00d7 akiyamana is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance for wet soils and ability to stabilize shoreline areas."
