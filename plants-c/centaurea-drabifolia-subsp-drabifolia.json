    "intro": "Centaurea drabifolia subsp. drabifolia, commonly known as the alpine centaurea, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
