It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions."
