    "intro": "Cochemiea halei, commonly known as the Hale's cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, branched plant with cylindrical stems covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Cochemiea halei is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its structure and appearance make it a distinctive and hardy addition to desert landscapes."
