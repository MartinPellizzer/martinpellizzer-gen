    "intro": "Centaurea elegans, commonly known as the elegant centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces bright blue or purple flower heads, which are composed of many small, tubular florets arranged in a composite structure. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Centaurea elegans is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
