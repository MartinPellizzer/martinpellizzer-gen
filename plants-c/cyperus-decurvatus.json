    "intro": "Cyperus decurvatus, commonly known as the drooping flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic ecosystems. Cyperus decurvatus is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive, upright growth habit."
