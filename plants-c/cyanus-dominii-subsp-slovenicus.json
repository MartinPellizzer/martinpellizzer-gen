    "intro": "Cyanus dominii subsp. slovenicus, commonly known as the Slovenian blueweed, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its foliage is lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
