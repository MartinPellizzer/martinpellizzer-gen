    "intro": "Casearia angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf casearia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its simple, elliptic to lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and potential ornamental use."
