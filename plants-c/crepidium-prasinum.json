    "intro": "Crepidium prasinum, commonly known as the green orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
