    "intro": "Chenopodium virginicum, commonly known as lambsquarters, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, dry fruits called achene, which are typically surrounded by a pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Chenopodium virginicum is also known for its nutritional value, as it is rich in minerals like iron and calcium."
