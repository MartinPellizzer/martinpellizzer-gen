    "intro": "Carex glauciformis, commonly known as the blue-green sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features grass-like leaves that are generally blue-green in color, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike of small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex glauciformis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
