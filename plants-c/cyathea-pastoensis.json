    "intro": "Cyathea pastoensis, commonly known as the Pasto tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to South America, particularly found in Colombia and Ecuador. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical rainforests. Its rhizome is thick and robust, supporting the growth of its tall, upright form. The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, contributing to the plant's ornamental value."
