    "intro": "Croton pilgeri, commonly known as the Pilger's croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to red and yellow. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive."
