    "intro": "Cascarilla gaudichaudiana, commonly known as the yellow sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its essential oil, extracted from the heartwood, is valued for its medicinal and aromatic properties. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
