It is a tall, columnar cactus with a distinctive spiny appearance, adapted to thrive in arid and saline environments. The plant features thick, ribbed stems that store water, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink, blooming at night. It has a slow growth rate and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The species is also notable for its ability to survive in harsh, coastal conditions with minimal water."
