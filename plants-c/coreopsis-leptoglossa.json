It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps and marshes. The plant features slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in summer and are clustered in a cylindrical shape. It is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
