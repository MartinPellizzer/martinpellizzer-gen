    "intro": "Coffea arabica var. mokka, commonly known as Mokka, is a subspecies of the arabica coffee plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia and Yemen. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped berries and dark green, serrated leaves. The plant thrives in tropical climates with high altitudes, moderate temperatures, and consistent rainfall. Mokka beans are known for their complex flavor profile, featuring notes of dark chocolate, spices, and citrus. Due to its unique taste and lower yield, Mokka is considered a rare and prized variety in the coffee industry."
