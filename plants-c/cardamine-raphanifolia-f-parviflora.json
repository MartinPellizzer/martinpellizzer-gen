    "intro": "Cardamine raphanifolia f. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to other members of the cruciferous family. The variety f. parviflora is distinguished by its smaller flowers and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form."
