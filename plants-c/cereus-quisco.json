    "intro": "Cereus quisco, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. Cereus quisco is often cultivated for its striking floral display and ease of care."
