    "intro": "Caladenia flava, commonly known as the yellow spider-orchid, is an endemic orchid species found in southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and distinctive yellow flowers with a greenish-brown lip. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils within heathland or open forests. Caladenia flava is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
