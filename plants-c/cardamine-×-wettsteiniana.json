It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to the mountainous regions of Europe, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help protect it from herbivores and excessive sunlight.
