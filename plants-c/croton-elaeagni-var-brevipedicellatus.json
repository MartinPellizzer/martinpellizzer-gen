    "intro": "Croton elaeagni var. brevipedicellatus, commonly known as the narrow-pedunculate croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features alternate, simple, and often elliptical or ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered yellow-green flowers that are typically followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it may be invasive in some areas."
