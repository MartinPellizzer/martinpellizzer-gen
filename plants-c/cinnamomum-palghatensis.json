    "intro": "Cinnamomum palghatensis, commonly known as Palghat cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. Its bark and leaves are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to cinnamon. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species."
