    "intro": "Carex speciosa var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in North America. It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and dark green, with a distinctive, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full to partial sun and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other water-saturated habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland gardens and ecological restoration projects."
