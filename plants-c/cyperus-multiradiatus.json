    "intro": "Cyperus multiradiatus, commonly known as the spike rush, is a flowering plant in the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, triangular stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along waterways. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-lobed, dry fruits. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
