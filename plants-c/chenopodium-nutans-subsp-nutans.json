    "intro": "Chenopodium nutans subsp. nutans, commonly known as the prostrate goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy stems and alternate leaves that are typically ovate to rhombic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are often borne on short pedicels. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, making it a common weed in dry landscapes."
