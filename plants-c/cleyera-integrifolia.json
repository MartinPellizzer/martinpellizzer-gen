    "intro": "Cleyera integrifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf cleyera, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Its leaves are typically oval to elliptic in shape, with smooth or slightly toothed margins, and it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. Cleyera integrifolia is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
