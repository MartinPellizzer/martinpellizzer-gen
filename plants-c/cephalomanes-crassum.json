    "intro": "Cephalomanes crassum, commonly known as the broad-leafed sea lettuce, is a marine green alga found in coastal areas. It has a flattened, ribbon-like thallus that can grow up to several centimeters in length. The plant exhibits a branching structure with a central axis and lateral fronds. It thrives in shallow, tide-pool environments and is often found attached to rocks. Its simple morphology and rapid growth make it an important component of intertidal ecosystems."
