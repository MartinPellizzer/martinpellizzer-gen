    "intro": "Cyperus sinensis, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower spikes that are often green or reddish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Cyperus sinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in aquatic gardens or as a water filtration plant."
