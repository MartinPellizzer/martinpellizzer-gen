    "intro": "Cerastium latifolium subsp. latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitats."
