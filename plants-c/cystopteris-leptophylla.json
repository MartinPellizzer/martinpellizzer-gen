    "intro": "Cystopteris leptophylla, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of polypodiales fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed, humid habitats."
