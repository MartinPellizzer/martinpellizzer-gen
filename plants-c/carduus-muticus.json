    "intro": "Carduus muticus, commonly known as the hoary frostweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its grayish-green, woolly leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny areas such as meadows and rocky soils. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps reduce water loss. The flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance."
