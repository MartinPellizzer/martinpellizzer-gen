    "intro": "Cirsium joannae, commonly known as the Joanne's thistle, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Spain and Portugal. The plant is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cirsium joannae is considered a rare and endemic species."
