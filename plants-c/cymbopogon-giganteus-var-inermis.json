    "intro": "Cymbopogon giganteus var. inermis, commonly known as the lemongrass plant, is a perennial grass native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and aromatic, grass-like leaves that emit a strong citrus scent. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with narrow, blade-like leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a hardy and adaptable species. The essential oils extracted from its leaves are widely used in perfumery, aromatherapy, and traditional medicine."
