    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 massainum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome and produces large, leathery leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
