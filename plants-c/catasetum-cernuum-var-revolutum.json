    "intro": "Catasetum cernuum var. revolutum, commonly known as the rolling lip orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, hairy stems and large, showy flowers with a distinctive rolled lip. The plant produces a unique structure called a \"catasetum,\" which is a specialized pollination mechanism involving a pollinia that adheres to the pollinator. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and fascinating reproductive biology."
