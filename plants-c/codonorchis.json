    "intro": "Codonorchis, commonly known as the fairy slipper, is a genus of orchids native to North America. These plants are characterized by their unique, slipper-shaped flowers that resemble small cups or shoes. The leaves are typically broad and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base of the plant. Codonorchis species are usually found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. They rely on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a key aspect of their botanical ecology."
