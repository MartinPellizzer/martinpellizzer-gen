    "intro": "Colubrina sordida, commonly known as the sordid glorybower, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Colubrina sordida is often found in sandy soils along coastal areas and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and drought conditions."
