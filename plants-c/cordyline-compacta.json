    "intro": "Cordyline compacta, commonly known as the dwarf palm or tree fern, is a striking tropical plant native to New Zealand. It features a slender, unbranched trunk with a crown of feathery, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant is characterized by its ability to form a dense, compact rosette, which gives it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. Cordyline compacta is also known for its ability to produce small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, fleshy berries."
