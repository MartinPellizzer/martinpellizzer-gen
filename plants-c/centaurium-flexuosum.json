    "intro": "Centaurium flexuosum, commonly known as the flexible centaury, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it often grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Centaurium flexuosum is a perennial herb that is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens with well-drained soil."
