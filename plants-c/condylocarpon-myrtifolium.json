    "intro": "Condylocarpon myrtifolium, commonly known as the myrtle leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It typically grows on bark, wood, or soil, forming a thin, greenish to yellowish crust. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungal partner, which allows it to perform photosynthesis. It is often found in temperate regions and is used in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic properties. This lichen plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as an indicator species for environmental conditions."
