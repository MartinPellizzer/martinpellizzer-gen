    "intro": "Chingia sambasensis, commonly known as the Sambas orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Indonesia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that display a blend of violet and white hues, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chingia sambasensis is considered a conservation concern."
