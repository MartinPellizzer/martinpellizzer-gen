    "intro": "Cryptophoranthus hystrix, commonly known as the spiked cryptophoranthus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, spiny bracts that encase its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. The species is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in controlled indoor conditions."
