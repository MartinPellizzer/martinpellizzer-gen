    "intro": "Cipuropsis truncata, commonly known as the African bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, gray-green leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
