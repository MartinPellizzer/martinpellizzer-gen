    "intro": "Campanula decumbens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Campanula decumbens is well adapted to rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
