    "intro": "Caralluma umdausensis, commonly known as the Cape Flats prickly pear, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems to survive drought conditions. It has small, paddle-shaped leaves that are modified into spines, reducing water loss. Caralluma umdausensis is often found in rocky soils and is a hardy plant that thrives in full sun."
