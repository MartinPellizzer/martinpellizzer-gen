    "intro": "Cirsium dyris, commonly known as the purple thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny stems. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and a distinctive purple-pink flower head that blooms in late summer. Cirsium dyris thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its spines and toxic sap serve as natural defenses against herbivores."
