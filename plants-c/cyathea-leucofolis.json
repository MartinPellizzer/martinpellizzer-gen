    "intro": "Cyathea leucofolis, commonly known as the white-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a slow growth rate and thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Its fronds are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it its distinctive appearance. Cyathea leucofolis plays a role in tropical ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity."
