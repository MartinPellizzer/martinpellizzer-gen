    "intro": "Caralluma ortholoba, commonly known as the devil's tongue cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its spineless, cylindrical stems that often branch out into a shrub-like form. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to tubercles, which help minimize water loss in its harsh environment. Caralluma ortholoba is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems for survival."
