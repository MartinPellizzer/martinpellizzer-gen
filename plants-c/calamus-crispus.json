    "intro": "Calamus crispus, commonly known as the zigzag sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It is characterized by its slender, triangular stems that have a distinctive zigzag pattern, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight waxy coating. Calamus crispus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
