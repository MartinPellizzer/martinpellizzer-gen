    "intro": "Cirsium consociatum, commonly known as the clustered thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant features spiny, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and its purple to pink flowers are arranged in dense, spherical heads. It has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Cirsium consociatum is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
