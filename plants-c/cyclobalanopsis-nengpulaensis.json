    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis nengpulaensis, commonly known as the Nengpula ironwood, is a species of evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, dense wood that is highly resistant to decay. The plant produces small, cup-shaped fruits that contain one or two seeds, typical of the genus Cyclobalanopsis. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
