    "intro": "Chamaecistus procumbens, commonly known as desert sand verbena, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to survive in extreme desert conditions."
