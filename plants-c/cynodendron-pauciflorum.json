    "intro": "Cynodendron pauciflorum, commonly known as the sparse-flowered cynodendron, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value. Cynodendron pauciflorum is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
