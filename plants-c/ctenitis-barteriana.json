    "intro": "Ctenitis barteriana, commonly known as the Barter's brake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into segments with a serrated edge, giving it a unique appearance. Native to tropical regions of Central and South America, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
