    "intro": "Cyperus congestus var. brevis, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 inch wide, giving it a distinct appearance. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, three-lobed flowers. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
