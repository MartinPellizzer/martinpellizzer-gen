    "intro": "Cotyledon stricta, commonly known as the upright cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or purple in color, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Cotyledon stricta is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
