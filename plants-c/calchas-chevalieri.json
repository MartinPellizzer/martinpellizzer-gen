    "intro": "Calchas chevalieri, commonly known as the European marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats across Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in damp, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along riverbanks. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Calchas chevalieri is an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems and is protected in many European countries."
