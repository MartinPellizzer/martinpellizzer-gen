    "intro": "Cotyledon intermedia, commonly known as the \"Rugosa\" or \"Coral Cotyledon,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and orange, typically during the summer months. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Cotyledon intermedia is relatively easy to care for, requiring well-draining soil and minimal water."
