    "intro": "Crataegus glomerata, commonly known as the American hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of white flowers in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various birds and mammals. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and moist soils. The American hawthorn is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
