    "intro": "Camellia pukhangensis, commonly known as the Pukhang camellia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Theaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, camellia-like flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces red or orange-red flowers with a distinctive, waxy texture, making it a striking ornamental species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and requires partial shade to full sun, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
