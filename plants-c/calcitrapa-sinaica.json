It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low water availability. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette, and the stems are often short and branching. Calcitrapa sinaica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is of interest to botanists studying desert flora."
