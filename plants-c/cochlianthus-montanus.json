    "intro": "Cochlianthus montanus, commonly known as the mountain cochlianthus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Cochlianthus montanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
