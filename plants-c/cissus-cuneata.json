It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically followed by edible, round, green fruits. Cissus cuneata thrives in warm, humid environments and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its ability to climb and its attractive foliage make it a popular choice for hanging baskets and trellises."
