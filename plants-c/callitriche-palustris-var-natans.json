    "intro": "Callitriche palustris var. natans, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. It is characterized by its floating or submersed leaves that are typically opposite and oval in shape. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are often submerged, though they may emerge at the water's surface. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats on the water's surface. This species is often used as a food source by waterfowl and contributes to the ecological balance of aquatic ecosystems."
