It is characterized by its thalloid structure, which consists of a flattened, leaf-like body that grows close to the ground. The plant exhibits a distinctive quadrangular or square-shaped cross-section in its thallus, giving it its specific epithet. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Chondrorhyncha subquadrata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
