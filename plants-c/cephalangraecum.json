    "intro": "Cephalangraecum, commonly known as the \"star of Bethlehem,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Amaryllidaceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, forming a rosette at the base of the plant. Cephalangraecum species are native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where they thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant colors and unique floral structure."
