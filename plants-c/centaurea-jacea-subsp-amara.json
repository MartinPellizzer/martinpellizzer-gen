    "intro": "Centaurea jacea subsp. amara, commonly known as bitterweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features wiry, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow to red flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth and the presence of a bitter taste in its foliage."
