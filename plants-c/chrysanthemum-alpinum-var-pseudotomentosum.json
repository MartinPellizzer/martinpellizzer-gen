    "intro": "Chrysanthemum alpinum var. pseudotomentosum, commonly known as the alpine chrysanthemum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, silver-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in garden settings."
