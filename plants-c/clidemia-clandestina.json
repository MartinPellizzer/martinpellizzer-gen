    "intro": "Clidemia clandestina, commonly known as the hidden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and typically grows on the branches of other trees, deriving some of its nutrients from its host. The plant has small, opposite, oval-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white. Its berries are small and red, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
