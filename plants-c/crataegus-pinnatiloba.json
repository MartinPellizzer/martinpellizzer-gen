    "intro": "Crataegus pinnatiloba, commonly known as the compound-leaved hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely pinnately lobed leaves, which give it its common name, and its showy, white to pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Crataegus pinnatiloba typically grows in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
