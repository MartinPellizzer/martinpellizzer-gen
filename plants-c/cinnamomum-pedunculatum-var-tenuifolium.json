    "intro": "Cinnamomum pedunculatum var. tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cinnamon tree, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by ellipsoid berries containing a single seed. Its bark and leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their aromatic and antimicrobial properties. This variant is distinguished by its narrower foliage compared to the typical form of Cinnamomum pedunculatum."
