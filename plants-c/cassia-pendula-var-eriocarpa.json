    "intro": "Cassia pendula var. eriocarpa, commonly known as the silky cassia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its pendulous, racemose inflorescences bearing yellow, papery bracts that resemble flowers. The leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small, ovate leaflets that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and floral display."
