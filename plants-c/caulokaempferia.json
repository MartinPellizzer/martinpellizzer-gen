These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly India and Southeast Asia. Caulokaempferia species are characterized by their ornamental foliage and fragrant, showy flowers that often resemble those of true ginger. They typically grow as rhizomatous perennials, with tall, erect stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are usually clustered in inflorescences and can range in color from white to pink, making them popular in horticulture."
