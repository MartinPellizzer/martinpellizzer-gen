    "intro": "Conchocarpus hamadryadicus, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that often appear translucent, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds. The ghost fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
