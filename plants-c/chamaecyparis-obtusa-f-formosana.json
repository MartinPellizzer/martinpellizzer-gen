    "intro": "Chamaecyparis obtusa f. formosana, commonly known as the Formosan cedar, is a rare and ornamental variety of the Japanese cedar. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green foliage that turns a striking bronze in winter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by winged seeds, typical of the cypress family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant. Due to its limited natural range and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized nurseries."
