It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features robust, spiny stems and dark green, lobed leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to reddish-purple, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Carduus podacanthus is often found in dry, disturbed soils and can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
