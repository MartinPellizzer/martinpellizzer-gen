    "intro": "Carex riparia var. humilis, commonly known as the low marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It is well adapted to moist soils and can tolerate periodic flooding. This variety is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological stability of its habitat."
