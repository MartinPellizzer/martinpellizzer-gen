It typically grows in marshy or peaty soils, thriving in environments with high moisture content. The plant has slender, upright stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Capanemia uliginosa is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
