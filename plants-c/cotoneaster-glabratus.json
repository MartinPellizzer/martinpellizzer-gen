    "intro": "Cotoneaster glabratus, commonly known as the smooth cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters, featuring dense, compact growth with many branches. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a smooth texture, turning yellow in the autumn. Cotoneaster glabratus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness in various climates."
