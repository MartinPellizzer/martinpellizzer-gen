    "intro": "Carex ferruginea f. transiens, commonly known as the red-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically dark green with reddish veins, and it produces cylindrical spikes of small, brownish flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments. The variety 'transiens' is distinguished by its transition in foliage coloration, adding visual interest throughout the growing season."
