    "intro": "Carex longerostrata, commonly known as the long-beak sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland habitats. Carex longerostrata is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
