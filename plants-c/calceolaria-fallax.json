    "intro": "Calceolaria fallax, commonly known as the autumn calceolaria, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive hood-like structure. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist conditions, thriving in partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native environment. Calceolaria fallax is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to bloom in late summer to early autumn."
