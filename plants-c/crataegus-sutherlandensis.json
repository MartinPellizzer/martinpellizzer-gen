It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and inland areas, contributing to local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
