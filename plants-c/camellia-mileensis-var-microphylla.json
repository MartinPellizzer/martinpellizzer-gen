    "intro": "Camellia mileensis var. microphylla, commonly known as the Chinese camellia or small-leaved camellia, is a species native to southern China. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are relatively small compared to other camellia varieties. The plant produces striking red or pink flowers during the winter months, adding vibrant color to gardens. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
