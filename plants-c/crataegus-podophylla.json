    "intro": "Crataegus podophylla, commonly known as the small-fruited hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and small, red to orange berries that ripen in the fall. The plant belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to other hawthorn species. Its flowers are typically white or pink, appearing in clusters, and it produces a distinctive fruit with a persistent calyx. Crataegus podophylla is often found in woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
