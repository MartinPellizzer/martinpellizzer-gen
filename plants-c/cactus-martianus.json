    "intro": "Cactus martianus, commonly known as the Martian cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the arid regions of Mars. It possesses a thick, spiny stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in extreme desert conditions. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during brief periods of Martian moisture. Due to its adaptation to harsh environments, it is considered an important subject for studying plant survival in extraterrestrial conditions."
