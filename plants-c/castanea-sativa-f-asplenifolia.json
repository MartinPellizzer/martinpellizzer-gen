    "intro": "Castanea sativa f. asplenifolia, commonly known as the asplenifoliated sweet chestnut, is a unique form of the sweet chestnut tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a striking appearance. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks, similar to its parent species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and historical significance, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape tree."
