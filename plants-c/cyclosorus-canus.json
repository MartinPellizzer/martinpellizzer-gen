    "intro": "Cyclosorus canus, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, giving it a star-like appearance. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes. Its reproductive structures, including sporocarps, are borne on the underside of the leaves, facilitating spore dispersal. Cyclosorus canus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to water quality maintenance."
