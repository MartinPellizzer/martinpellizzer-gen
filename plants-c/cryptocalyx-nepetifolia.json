    "intro": "Cryptocalyx nepetifolia, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with slender, hairy stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Cryptocalyx nepetifolia is often found in dry, sunny habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
