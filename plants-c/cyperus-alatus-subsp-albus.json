    "intro": "Cyperus alatus subsp. albus, commonly known as the white flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are usually borne on short, lateral branches. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, making it a common sight in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure is adapted for water retention, with a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in aquatic habitats."
