    "intro": "Ceropegia longifolia var. exigua, commonly known as the dwarf string of hearts, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features trailing stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are typically borne in clusters along the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for hanging baskets and indoor gardens."
