    "intro": "Chorizanthe xanti var. leucotheca, commonly known as the white-flowered desert hibiscus, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert environments. Its botanical characteristics reflect its evolution in harsh, dry climates, with adaptations such as reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss."
