    "intro": "Centaurea jacea subsp. dracunculifolia, commonly known as the dragon's tail centaurea, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its striking red to orange flower heads, which are surrounded by narrow, grass-like bracts. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, often with a rough or hairy texture. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated, drooping flower heads that resemble a dragon's tail, giving it its common name."
