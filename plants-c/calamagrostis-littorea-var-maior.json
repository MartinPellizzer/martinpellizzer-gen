    "intro": "Calamagrostis littorea var. maior, commonly known as the coastal sweet grass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in moist, saline environments such as salt marshes and tidal flats, exhibiting salt tolerance and adaptability to fluctuating water levels. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, with a distinctive silvery bloom on the inflorescence. Its flowering stalks produce dense, spike-like clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils."
