    "intro": "Cenchrus uliginosus, commonly known as swamp grass or blackgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often coated with a fine layer of wax. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils, making it a common component of marshes and floodplain ecosystems. Due to its adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
