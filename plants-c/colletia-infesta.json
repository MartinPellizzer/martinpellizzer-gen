    "intro": "Colletia infesta, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapting well to harsh desert conditions. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves are succulent, helping it retain water in dry environments. Colletia infesta is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in low-water landscapes."
