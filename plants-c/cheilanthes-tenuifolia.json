    "intro": "Cheilanthes tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender lady fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is often found growing on limestone or sandstone. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family."
