    "intro": "Crepis stocksiana, commonly known as the Stocks' thistle, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in clustered heads. It has a hairy stem and is typically perennial, though it may behave as an annual in some regions. Its name reflects its historical use in traditional medicine and its resemblance to the common stock plant."
