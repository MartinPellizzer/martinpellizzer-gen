    "intro": "Chrysosplenium woroschilovii, commonly known as the Woroschilov's golden spleenwort, is a small, evergreen perennial herb belonging to the family Saxifragaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually bright green. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
