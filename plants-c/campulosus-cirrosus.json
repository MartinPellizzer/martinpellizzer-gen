    "intro": "Campulosus cirrosus, commonly known as the hairy mountain bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and hairy, bluish-green foliage that becomes more prominent in the summer months. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are easily dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open grasslands and disturbed soils. It thrives in full sun and is often found in prairie ecosystems, where it plays a vital role in soil stabilization and habitat provision. Due to its hardy nature, it is also used in ecological restoration projects."
