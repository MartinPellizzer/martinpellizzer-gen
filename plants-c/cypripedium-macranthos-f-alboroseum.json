    "intro": "Cypripedium macranthos f. alboroseum, commonly known as the White Rose Lady's Slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. This variant is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which resemble a rose in appearance, giving it its common name. The plant features a single, large, pouch-like lip that is a distinctive feature of the Cypripedium genus. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Due to its rarity and beauty, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
