    "intro": "Cleome canescens, commonly known as the desert blueweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cleome canescens is also known for its ability to self-seed readily, contributing to its presence in disturbed or sandy soils."
