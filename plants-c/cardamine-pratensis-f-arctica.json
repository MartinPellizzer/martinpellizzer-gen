    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis f. arctica, commonly known as the Arctic watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is typically found in alpine and arctic environments. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in a raceme, which are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, helping to reduce water loss in cold, windy conditions. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to harsh climates and is a valuable component of alpine ecosystems."
