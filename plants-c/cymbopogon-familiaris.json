    "intro": "Cymbopogon familiaris, commonly known as lemon grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often aromatic and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers in cylindrical clusters, which are typically borne at the top of the stalks. Lemon grass is widely cultivated for its fragrant oils, which are used in cooking, perfumery, and traditional medicine. Its rhizomes and leaves contain essential oils rich in citral, contributing to its distinctive lemony scent."
