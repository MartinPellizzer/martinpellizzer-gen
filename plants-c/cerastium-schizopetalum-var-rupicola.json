    "intro": "Cerastium schizopetalum var. rupicola, commonly known as the rock cranesbill, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in fine hairs. This variety is distinguished by its compact growth habit and is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
