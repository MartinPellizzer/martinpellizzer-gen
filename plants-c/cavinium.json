    "intro": "Cavinium, commonly known as the \"sea buckthorn,\" is a shrub belonging to the family Hippophae. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North America, and is characterized by its yellow or orange berries that are rich in vitamins and antioxidants. The plant thrives in harsh environments, including coastal areas and arid regions, due to its drought-resistant properties. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, and the plant produces small, yellow flowers in the spring. Cavinium has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and as a source of nutritional supplements."
