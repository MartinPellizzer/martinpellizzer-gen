    "intro": "Carex petitiana, commonly known as the Petit's sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense spikes. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
