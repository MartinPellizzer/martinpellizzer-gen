It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, often greenish-yellow in color, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Carapichea squamelligera is often found in secondary forests and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
