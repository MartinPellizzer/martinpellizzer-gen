It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant features simple, elliptical leaves with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, and range in color from white to pink, producing a distinctive aromatic scent. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
