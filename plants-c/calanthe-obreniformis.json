    "intro": "Calanthe obreniformis, commonly known as the broad-leafed calanthe, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, broad, elliptical leaves that are often adorned with a distinctive white or pale green midrib. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically during the spring and early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Calanthe obreniformis is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
