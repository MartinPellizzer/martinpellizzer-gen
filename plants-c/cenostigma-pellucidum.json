It is characterized by its striking, translucent leaves that give it its common name. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a fibrous sheath. Its leaves are pinnate, with a smooth, waxy surface and a distinct, elongated shape. Cenostigma pellucidum is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland areas with a warm, arid climate."
