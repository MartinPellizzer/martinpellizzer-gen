    "intro": "Cardamine laciniata subsp. multifida, commonly known as the cut-leaved watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic habitats. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stems. Its root system is adapted for nutrient uptake in waterlogged soils, and it is often found in streams, marshes, and wet meadows. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Roridula genus, sharing similar ecological preferences and morphological traits."
