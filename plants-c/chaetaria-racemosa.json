    "intro": "Chaetaria racemosa, commonly known as the clustered hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, tufted stems with dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. The flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
