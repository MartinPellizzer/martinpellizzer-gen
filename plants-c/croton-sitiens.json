    "intro": "Croton sitiens, commonly known as the velvetleaf croton, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange or red fruits containing three seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
