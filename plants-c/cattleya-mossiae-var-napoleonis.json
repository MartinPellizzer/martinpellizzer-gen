    "intro": "Cattleya mossiae var. napoleonis, commonly known as Napoleon's Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid prized for its vibrant, fragrant flowers. It features large, showy blossoms with a distinctive color palette of pink, white, and lavender, often with a contrasting lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on trees in its natural habitat, and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. It blooms once a year, typically in the spring or early summer, and thrives in humid environments with well-draining potting media. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively manageable care requirements."
