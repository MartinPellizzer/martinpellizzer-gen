    "intro": "Ctenitis decurrenti-pinnata, commonly known as the decurrent pinnate tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that are pinnately compound. The fronds are typically green and have a delicate, lace-like appearance due to their finely divided segments. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its unique morphology makes it a distinctive and ornamental species in botanical collections."
