It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and dense canopy of glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that give way to edible, red berries resembling cherries. These berries are not only ornamental but also valued for their culinary and medicinal uses. Chrysophyllum msolo thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks."
