    "intro": "Cousinia semilacera, commonly known as the pale hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, pale blue to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cousinia semilacera plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
