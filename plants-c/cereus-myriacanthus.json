    "intro": "Cereus myriacanthus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers are short-lived, lasting only a single night, and are followed by the development of red, fleshy fruits. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system."
