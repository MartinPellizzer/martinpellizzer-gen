    "intro": "[WRONG START] COLDENIA HISPIDISSIMA, commonly known as the rough coldenia, is a shrub native to the eastern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature. Coldenia hispidissima plays a role in supporting local insect populations, particularly bees and other pollinators."
