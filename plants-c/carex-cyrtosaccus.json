    "intro": "Carex cyrtosaccus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wetlands, and prefers partial to full shade. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Carex cyrtosaccus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
