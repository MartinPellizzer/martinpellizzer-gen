It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers, typically in shades of green or brown, which are arranged in a dense inflorescence. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a pointed tip, contributing to its common name. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
