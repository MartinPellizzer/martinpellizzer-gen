    "intro": "Ctenitis koordersii, commonly known as the Koorders' tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Its fronds are often covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety spores, which are released in abundance. Ctenitis koordersii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
