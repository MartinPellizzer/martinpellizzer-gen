    "intro": "Crepidium dentatum, commonly known as the toothed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and prairies. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single or few leaves, and its flowers are small, greenish-white with intricate patterns. It produces a single spike of flowers, each with three sepals and three petals, with the lateral petals often notched or toothed. Crepidium dentatum is a relatively rare and endangered species, requiring specific ecological conditions for successful growth."
