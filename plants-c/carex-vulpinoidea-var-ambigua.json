    "intro": "Carex vulpinoidea var. ambigua, commonly known as the foxnut sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife."
