    "intro": "Carex cruciata var. nagporensis, commonly known as the Nagpore sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is native to parts of South Asia, including India and Nepal, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, making it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat creation for various wildlife species."
