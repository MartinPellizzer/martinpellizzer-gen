It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshy areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
