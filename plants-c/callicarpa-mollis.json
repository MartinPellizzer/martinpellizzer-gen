    "intro": "Callicarpa mollis, commonly known as the red beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The plant thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its berries are edible for birds and some mammals but are considered toxic to humans. The ornamental value of Callicarpa mollis comes from its vibrant foliage and striking fruit display."
