    "intro": "Corydalis uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
