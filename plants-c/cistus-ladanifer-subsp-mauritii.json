    "intro": "Cistus ladanifer subsp. mauritii, commonly known as the Mauritius rockrose, is a shrub native to the island of Mauritius. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a resinous substance known as ladanum, which is used in perfumery and traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and Mediterranean climates. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in its native region."
