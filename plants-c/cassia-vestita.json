    "intro": "Cassia vestita, commonly known as the white cassia, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and compound leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, which are followed by long, narrow pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. Cassia vestita is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some cultures."
