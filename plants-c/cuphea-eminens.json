    "intro": "Cuphea eminens, commonly known as the flame flower, is a striking plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces vibrant, tubular red bracts resembling flames, which are not actually flowers but modified leaves. The plant features showy inflorescences that attract hummingbirds and other pollinators due to their nectar-rich blossoms. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Cuphea eminens is known for its drought tolerance and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
