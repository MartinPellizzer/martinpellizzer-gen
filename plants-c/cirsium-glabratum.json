    "intro": "Cirsium glabratum, commonly known as the smooth thistle, is a perennial plant native to western North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish-purple flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and grasslands. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
