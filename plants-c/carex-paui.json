    "intro": "Carex paui, commonly known as the Paui sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of New Zealand. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in swampy or marshy habitats. Its small, clustered flower heads are usually greenish or brownish, and it produces three-sided, spike-like inflorescences. Carex paui plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
