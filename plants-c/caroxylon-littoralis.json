    "intro": "Caroxylon littoralis, commonly known as the coastal sedge, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet, saline environments such as tidal flats and mangrove swamps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often greenish or reddish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize coastal soils, contributing to erosion control. Caroxylon littoralis plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of its habitat."
