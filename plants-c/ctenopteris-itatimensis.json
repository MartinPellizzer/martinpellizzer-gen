    "intro": "Ctenopteris itatimensis, commonly known as the Itatim fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, compound fronds that can reach significant lengths. The fronds are typically dark green and have a distinctive, finely divided structure that enhances its ornamental value. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary forests. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both horticultural and conservation purposes."
