    "intro": "Colletia multiflora, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to conserve water, making it well-suited for harsh, dry environments. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Colletia multiflora plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for various desert wildlife."
