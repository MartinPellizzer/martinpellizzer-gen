    "intro": "Chianthemum plicatum, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets. The plant produces small, showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. Chianthemum plicatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
