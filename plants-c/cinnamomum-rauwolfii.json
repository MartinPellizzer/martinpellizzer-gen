It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and bark. The plant produces small, white flowers and yellowish fruits that contain winged seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. The bark, while not as commercially valuable as true cinnamon, is also used in local remedies and as a spice."
