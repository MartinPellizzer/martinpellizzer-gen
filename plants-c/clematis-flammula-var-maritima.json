    "intro": "Clematis flammula var. maritima, commonly known as the sea clematis, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It is a deciduous vine characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in maritime climates where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and typically have a slightly hairy texture. The sea clematis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
