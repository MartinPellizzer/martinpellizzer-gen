    "intro": "Cyclosorus sakayensis, commonly known as the Sakay's cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically four-lobed and resemble a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures, including tiny spore-producing organs, are located on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
