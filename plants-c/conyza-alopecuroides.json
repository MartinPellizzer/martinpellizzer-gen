    "intro": "Conyza alopecuroides, commonly known as common sandmat, is an annual flowering plant native to Africa but now widely distributed in temperate regions. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, white to yellowish composite flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces numerous tiny seeds that are easily dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in new environments. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its adaptability to various ecological conditions."
