    "intro": "Crocus sativus var. elwesii, commonly known as the Elwes' saffron crocus, is a lesser-known variant of the saffron crocus. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers with prominent, recurved petals. The plant produces small, pale yellow stigmas that are used in culinary and medicinal applications, similar to those of the standard saffron crocus. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is less commonly cultivated than the standard saffron crocus but is appreciated for its ornamental value and unique floral display."
