    "intro": "Cyanea longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf cyanea, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss. Cyanea longifolia is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty."
