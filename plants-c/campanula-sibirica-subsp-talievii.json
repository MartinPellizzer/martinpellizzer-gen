    "intro": "Campanula sibirica subsp. talievii, commonly known as the Taliev's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, bearing clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The leaves are typically lanceolate and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
