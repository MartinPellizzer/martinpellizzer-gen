    "intro": "Cynometra leonensis, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sterculiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain edible seeds. These seeds are traditionally used to make shea butter, a valuable natural product in cosmetics and food industries. The plant also plays an important role in agroforestry and soil conservation in its native habitat."
