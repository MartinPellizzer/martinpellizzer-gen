It is characterized by its striking, mosaic-like patterns on its leaves and flowers, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within the understory of tropical forests. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pink and purple. Chailletia tesselata is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its habitat."
