    "intro": "Cinchona lineata, commonly known as the yellow quinine tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Bolivia. The plant is notable for its ornamental value, featuring showy yellow flowers and attractive foliage. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. The tree is also historically significant for its role in the production of quinine, though it is not as widely cultivated for medicinal purposes as other cinchona species."
