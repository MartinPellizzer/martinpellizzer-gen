It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in subtropical gardens."
