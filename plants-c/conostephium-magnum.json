    "intro": "Conostephium magnum, commonly known as the giant conostephium, is a striking shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its tall, woody stems and large, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and native plant collections."
