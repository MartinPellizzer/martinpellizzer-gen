    "intro": "Catopsis compacta, commonly known as the miniature fern, is a small, compact plant belonging to the Polypodiaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with dense, overlapping fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a feathery appearance, and the spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Catopsis compacta is often used in horticulture as a decorative plant due to its compact size and elegant foliage."
