    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 bigaradia var. glaberrima, commonly known as the rough lemon, is a hybrid citrus plant characterized by its small, yellow-orange fruits and thorny branches. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a rootstock for other citrus trees. The leaves are broadly elliptical with a rough, waxy texture, and the fruit has a thick, bitter rind. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand cold temperatures compared to other citrus species."
