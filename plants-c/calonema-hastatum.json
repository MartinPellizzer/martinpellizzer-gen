    "intro": "Calonema hastatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed calonema, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions of India, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically small, tubular, and come in shades of white, pink, or purple. Calonema hastatum is often grown as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
