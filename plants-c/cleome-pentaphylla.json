It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into five lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom throughout the summer. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun. Cleome pentaphylla is a herbaceous annual that is relatively easy to grow in gardens, making it a popular choice for ornamental purposes."
