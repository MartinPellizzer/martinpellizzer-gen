    "intro": "Cliffordiochloa, commonly known as the African grass or cliff grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its erect, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plants typically produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Cliffordiochloa species are often found in rocky or sandy soils, growing in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. These grasses are adapted to arid or semi-arid conditions, showing resilience to drought and poor soil nutrients."
