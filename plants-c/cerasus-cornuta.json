    "intro": "Cerasus cornuta, commonly known as the horned cherry, is a species of flowering plant in the Prunus genus. It is native to East Asia, particularly China, and is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like projections on its fruit. The plant produces small, sweet, edible fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive flowers and unique fruit morphology. The leaves are ovate and have a smooth texture, while the bark is smooth and grayish in color."
