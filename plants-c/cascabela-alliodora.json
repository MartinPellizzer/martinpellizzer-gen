    "intro": "Cascabela alliodora, commonly known as the fragrant cascabela, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by orange-red berries containing smooth, oval seeds. Its foliage and fruits emit a distinctive, spicy fragrance, which is attributed to the presence of volatile oils. Cascabela alliodora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
