It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Its seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to other members of the Apiaceae family."
