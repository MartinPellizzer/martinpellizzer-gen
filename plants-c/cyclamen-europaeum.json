    "intro": "Cyclamen europaeum, commonly known as the European cyclamen, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces clusters of delicate, spurred flowers in shades of pink, white, and red. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant. Its bulbs store nutrients, allowing it to survive periods of dormancy. Cyclamen europaeum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is relatively easy to care for with proper light and watering conditions."
