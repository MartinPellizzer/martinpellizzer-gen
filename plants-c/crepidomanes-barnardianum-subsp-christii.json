    "intro": "Crepidomanes barnardianum subsp. christii, commonly known as the Christ's crepidomanes, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. This subspecies is native to South Africa, particularly found in the Western Cape region, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. It features slender, branched stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal. The small white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in compound umbels, typical of the carrot family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
