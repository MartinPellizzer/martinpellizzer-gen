    "intro": "Cerasus avium var. rubroactina, commonly known as the red-fruited cherry, is a variant of the sweet cherry species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive red-colored fruits, which are typically smaller and more intensely flavored compared to standard cherries. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with simple, alternate leaves that are oval and slightly serrated. It produces showy white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by the characteristic red fruits in late summer. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its culinary uses in jams, desserts, and fresh consumption."
