    "intro": "Candollea cygnorum, commonly known as the swan's foot orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Candollea cygnorum is considered a rare and endangered species."
