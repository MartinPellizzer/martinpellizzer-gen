    "intro": "Chazaliella obanensis, commonly known as the Oban sandwort, is a rare flowering plant native to the Scottish Highlands. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
