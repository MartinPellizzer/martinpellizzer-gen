    "intro": "Callistemon rigidus, commonly known as the rigid bottlebrush, is an evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive red or pink bottlebrush-like flowers that appear in dense, cylindrical clusters. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period, which can extend from spring to autumn."
