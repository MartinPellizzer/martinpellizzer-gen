    "intro": "Coffea eugenioides var. kivuensis, commonly known as the Kivu coffee or Kivu wild coffee, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and Eastern Africa. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves and small, white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain two seeds, which are the source of its caffeine content. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the montane forests of the Eastern African highlands. This species is of interest to botanists and coffee growers due to its unique genetic makeup and potential for developing new coffee varieties."
