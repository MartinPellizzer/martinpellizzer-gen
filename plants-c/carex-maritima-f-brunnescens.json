    "intro": "Carex maritima f. brunnescens, commonly known as the brown-stem sedges, is a variant of the coastal sedge native to maritime environments. It is characterized by its dark brown, often reddish stems that contrast with its narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in saline or brackish wetlands, demonstrating a tolerance for high salt levels and fluctuating water conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike that bears small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
