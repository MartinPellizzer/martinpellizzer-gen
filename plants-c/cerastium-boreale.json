    "intro": "Cerastium boreale, commonly known as the snowberry or northern chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has hairy stems and alternate, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Cerastium boreale is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in early spring."
