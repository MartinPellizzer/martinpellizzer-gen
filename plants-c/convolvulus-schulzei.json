    "intro": "Convolvulus schulzei, commonly known as the desert bluecurl, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with trailing stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its flowers are characterized by their tubular shape and curling petals, which give it its common name. Convolvulus schulzei is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water availability."
