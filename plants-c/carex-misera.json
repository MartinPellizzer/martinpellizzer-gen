    "intro": "Carex misera, commonly known as the melancholy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in poorly drained soils and its preference for full to partial shade. Carex misera plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
