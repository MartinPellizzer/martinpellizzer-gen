It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that gives it a powdery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange or red berries. Its leaves contain a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested. Croton farinosus is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage."
