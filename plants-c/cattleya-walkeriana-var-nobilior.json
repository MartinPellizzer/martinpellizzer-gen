    "intro": "Cattleya walkeriana var. nobilior, commonly known as the noble Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and purple, with a distinctive lip that is often a different hue. The plant produces thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it blooms during the summer months. This variety is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and fragrance."
