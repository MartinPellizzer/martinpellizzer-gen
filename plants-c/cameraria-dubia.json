    "intro": "Cameraria dubia, commonly known as the cherry fruit tortrix moth, is a small leaf-mining moth native to Europe. Its larvae feed on the leaves of Prunus species, including cherries, plums, and peaches, causing visible damage by creating serpentine mines. The adult moth has a wingspan of about 10-12 mm, with grayish-brown wings patterned with dark markings. The life cycle involves several generations per year, with larvae completing development within the leaf tissue. This pest is a significant concern in orchards due to its ability to reduce fruit quality and yield."
