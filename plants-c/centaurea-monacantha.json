    "intro": "Centaurea monacantha, commonly known as the monoceros thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, bristly stems and leaves, which are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces bright yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides. Centaurea monacantha is a hardy perennial that can spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in disturbed areas."
