    "intro": "Cuscuta epithymum var. pallens, commonly known as the pale dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hairless, thread-like stems. The plant is typically found growing on various host plants, including grasses and other weeds. Its seeds are dispersed through the wind, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
