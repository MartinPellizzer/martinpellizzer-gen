It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, typical of the conifer family. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is also cultivated as an ornamental plant."
