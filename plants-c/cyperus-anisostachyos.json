    "intro": "Cyperus anisostachyos, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flatsedge, is a species of sedge native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swamps and floodplains. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Cyperus anisostachyos is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
