    "intro": "Crinum macrocarpon, commonly known as the giant crinum or red crinum, is a striking bulbous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem that can reach up to 3 meters in height, supporting its vibrant blooms. Its bulbs are large and fleshy, adapted for storing water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in seasonal climates. Crinum macrocarpon is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also noted for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor."
