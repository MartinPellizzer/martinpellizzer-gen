It is a low-growing annual herb that produces small, yellow flowers and fleshy, green leaves. The plant is adapted to arid environments and has a succulent appearance, which helps it retain moisture. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes other flowering plants such as hibiscus. Calandrinia viridis is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
