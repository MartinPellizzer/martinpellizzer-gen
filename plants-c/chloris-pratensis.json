    "intro": "Chloris pratensis, commonly known as meadow foxtail, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple at maturity. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Chloris pratensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
