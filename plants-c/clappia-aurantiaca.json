    "intro": "Clappia aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange-leafed clappia, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking orange-red leaves, which are often covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Clappia aurantiaca is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
