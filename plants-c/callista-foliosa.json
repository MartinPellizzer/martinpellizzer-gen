It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often display vibrant colors. The plant has elongated, narrow leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
