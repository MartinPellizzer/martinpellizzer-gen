    "intro": "Crepidium sciaphilum, commonly known as the shadow orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the shaded understories of tropical forests. It is characterized by its small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant typically grows in low light conditions, relying on the filtered sunlight that penetrates through the dense canopy. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions."
