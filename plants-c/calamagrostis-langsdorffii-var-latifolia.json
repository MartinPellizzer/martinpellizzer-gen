    "intro": "Calamagrostis langsdorffii var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia. It features slender, arching stems that produce feathery panicles of silver-green flowers in late summer. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves that are broader than the typical variety, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along stream banks. This ornamental grass is valued for its attractive foliage and is used in wetland restoration projects."
