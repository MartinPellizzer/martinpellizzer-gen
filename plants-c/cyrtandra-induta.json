    "intro": "Cyrtandra induta, commonly known as the Hawaiian bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the island of Hawaii. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in the understory of native Hawaiian forests. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Cyrtandra induta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
