    "intro": "Caladenia carnea var. gracillima, commonly known as the pink-stemmed spider orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, pinkish-green stems and delicate, spider-like flowers that range from pale pink to deep red. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. It is a perennial herb with a short-lived, fleshy rhizome and produces its showy blooms during the cooler months of spring and autumn. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
