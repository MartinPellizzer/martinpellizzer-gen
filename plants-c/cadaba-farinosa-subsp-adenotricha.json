    "intro": "Cadaba farinosa subsp. adenotricha, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf and stem structure."
