    "intro": "Chaetaria olygantha, commonly known as the golden haircup, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. The plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it forms dense mats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it its common name."
