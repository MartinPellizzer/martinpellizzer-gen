It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
