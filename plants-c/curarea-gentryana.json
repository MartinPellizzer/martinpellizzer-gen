    "intro": "Curarea gentryana, commonly known as the Gentry's arrow poison, is a climbing plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and yellowish-green stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Curarea gentryana is notable for containing curare, a potent neurotoxin used historically by indigenous peoples for hunting. Its botanical significance lies in its chemical composition and traditional use in ethnobotanical contexts."
