    "intro": "Claytonia lanceolata var. idahoensis, commonly known as Idaho mountain sorrel, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Idaho and surrounding areas. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with succulent, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to add a touch of color to rocky or alpine landscapes."
