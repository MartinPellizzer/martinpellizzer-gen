    "intro": "Cleyria, commonly known as the false holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plants are shrubs or small trees with opposite, simple, and often leathery leaves. They produce small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by small, fleshy fruits. Cleyria species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
