    "intro": "Cardamine aspera, commonly known as the rough watercress, is a herbaceous plant native to moist environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, stream sides, and marshy areas, thriving in damp, shaded conditions. The plant has alternate, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its small, white or greenish flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring. The plant is known for its peppery flavor and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
