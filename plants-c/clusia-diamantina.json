    "intro": "Clusia diamantina, commonly known as diamond clusterleaf, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered together. Its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types makes it a popular ornamental plant. Clusia diamantina is also known for its resilience to drought and its ability to tolerate partial shade."
