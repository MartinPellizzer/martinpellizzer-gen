    "intro": "Cynosurus neglectus, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are clustered closely together, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Cynosurus neglectus is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
