    "intro": "Carlina vulgaris subsp. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf carline thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring a rosette of blue-green, hairy leaves at the base. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of violet or purple capitula, which are composed of many small, tubular florets. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, and the plant is often found in grasslands, meadows, and rocky soils. Carlina vulgaris subsp. longifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
