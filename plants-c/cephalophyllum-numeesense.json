    "intro": "Cephalophyllum numeesense, commonly known as the desert star cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a distinctive star-shaped crown of fleshy, paddle-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on the top of the stem. Its specialized structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
