    "intro": "Caladenia leptochila, commonly known as the slender-leafed spider-orchid, is an orchid species native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its striking, spider-like flowers that are typically pale green with a distinctive red or purple lip. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. It blooms between September and November, producing fragrant flowers that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
