    "intro": "Camellia parvilimba var. brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf camellia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to China. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are oval in shape and slightly leathery in texture. The plant produces showy, camellia-like flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and relatively slow growth, it is often cultivated in containers or as a specimen plant."
