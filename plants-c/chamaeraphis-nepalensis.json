    "intro": "Chamaeraphis nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal glassworts, is a halophytic plant native to saline and coastal environments in Nepal. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and saline conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in summer. Its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations makes it an important species in ecological studies of salt-tolerant flora. Chamaeraphis nepalensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in coastal and saline regions, contributing to ecosystem resilience."
