    "intro": "Callisthene glazioui, commonly known as the Glaziou's starflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Onagraceae, which includes other flowering plants such as willows and evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, typically in the spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
