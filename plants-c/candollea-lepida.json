    "intro": "Candollea lepida, commonly known as the pale candollea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding basin. The plant produces showy, inflorescence with bright red or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss. Candollea lepida is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and adaptability to greenhouse conditions."
