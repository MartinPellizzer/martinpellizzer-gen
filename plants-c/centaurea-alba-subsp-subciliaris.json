    "intro": "Centaurea alba subsp. subciliaris, commonly known as the white centaury, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, branching stems that grow up to 60 cm in height, often with a woolly appearance due to its dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive silvery-green coloration on the underside. This species is often found in dry, calcareous soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
