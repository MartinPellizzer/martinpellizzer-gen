It is a member of the Fumariaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
