    "intro": "Cucubalus dubrensis, commonly known as the Dubren Island cucumber, is a rare flowering plant native to the remote Dubren Islands in the South Pacific. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers, gourds, and squash. The plant features broad, lobed leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the morning. Its fruits are elongated and typically measure around 15-20 centimeters in length, with a thick, waxy skin. Due to its limited habitat and low population, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
