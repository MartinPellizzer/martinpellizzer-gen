It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicles that contain seeds with silky hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
