    "intro": "Centaurea cyprensis, commonly known as Cyprus star-thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny bracts. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss."
