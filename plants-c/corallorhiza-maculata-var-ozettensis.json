    "intro": "Corallorhiza maculata var. ozettensis, commonly known as the Ozette coralroot, is a flowering plant in the orchid family. It is a myco-heterotrophic species, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for nutrients. This variant is typically found in moist, shaded forest habitats across the Pacific Northwest. Its small, white or pink flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant's unique ecological role highlights its dependence on symbiotic relationships with fungi for survival."
