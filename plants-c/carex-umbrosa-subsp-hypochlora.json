    "intro": "Carex umbrosa subsp. hypochlora, commonly known as the pale sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, stream banks, and other areas with consistently damp soil. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-green hue, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense spikes. This subspecies is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
