    "intro": "Cyperus longus var. leptochlaenus, commonly known as slender flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. Its slender, triangular stems are covered with small, scale-like leaves, and it produces spikelets that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. The botanical characteristics of this variant make it distinct from other Cyperus species, particularly in its leaf morphology and growth habit."
