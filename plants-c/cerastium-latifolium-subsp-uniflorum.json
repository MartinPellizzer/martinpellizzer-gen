It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
