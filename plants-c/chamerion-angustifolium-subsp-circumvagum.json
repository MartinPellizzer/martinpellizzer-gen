    "intro": "Chamerion angustifolium subsp. circumvagum, commonly known as fireweed or willow herb, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy pink to red flowers in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in tundra, wetlands, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
