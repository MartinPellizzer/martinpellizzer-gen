    "intro": "Cyphosperma trichospadix, commonly known as the spiky cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a rare and valuable species in botanical collections. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil."
