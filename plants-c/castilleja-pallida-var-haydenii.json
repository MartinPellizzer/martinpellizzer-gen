It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients through its root system. The plant features showy, red-orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. This species is often found in association with shrubs and is an important component of its ecosystem."
