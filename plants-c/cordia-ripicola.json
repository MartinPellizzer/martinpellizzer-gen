    "intro": "Cordia ripicola, commonly known as the river cordia, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It typically grows along riverbanks and in moist, sandy soils, adapting well to saline environments. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. Its flowers are small, clustered, and predominantly white or pale yellow, attracting various pollinators. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, facilitating wind dispersal."
