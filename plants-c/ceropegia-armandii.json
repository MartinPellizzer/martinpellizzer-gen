It features thick, fleshy stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often trailing or climbing. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive tubular structure. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine, powdery coating. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and leaves to survive dry conditions."
