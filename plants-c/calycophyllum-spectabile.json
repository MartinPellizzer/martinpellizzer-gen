    "intro": "Calycophyllum spectabile, commonly known as the showy calycophyllum, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that consist of numerous small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in a dense, spherical cluster. The plant belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes trees and shrubs known for their often fragrant flowers and medicinal properties. Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and ovate, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calycophyllum spectabile is considered an endangered species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its unique botanical features."
