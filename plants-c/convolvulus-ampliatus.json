    "intro": "Convolvulus ampliatus, commonly known as the broadleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, violet to blue flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant is a climbing vine with tendrils that help it ascend supports, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and showy blooms make it both a beautiful and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
