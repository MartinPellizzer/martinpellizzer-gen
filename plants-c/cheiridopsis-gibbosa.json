    "intro": "Cheiridopsis gibbosa, commonly known as the woolly ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically from spring to summer. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water. Due to its striking appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
