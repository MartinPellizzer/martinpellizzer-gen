    "intro": "Centrosema pascuorum var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in pastures. Its deep root system makes it drought-tolerant and useful for erosion control."
