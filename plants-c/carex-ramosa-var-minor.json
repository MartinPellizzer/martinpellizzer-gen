    "intro": "Carex ramosa var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf basket sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, cylindrical leaves that are typically a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in early summer, adding subtle floral interest. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
