    "intro": "Cypripedium delenatii, commonly known as the Delle's lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pinkish-brown coloration and intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, which are attracted by the plant's unique structure and scent. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cypripedium delenatii is critically endangered and is protected in many countries."
