It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically red or purple when mature. It thrives in coastal and lowland habitats, often found in scrub and forest margins. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
