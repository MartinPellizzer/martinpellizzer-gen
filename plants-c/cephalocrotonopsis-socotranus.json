It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped spines and fleshy, segmented stems. The plant is adapted to the arid and harsh conditions of its native habitat, exhibiting succulent features that help it store water. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, emerging from the axils of the spines. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
