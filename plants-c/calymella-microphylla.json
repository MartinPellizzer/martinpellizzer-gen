    "intro": "Calymella microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved calymella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
