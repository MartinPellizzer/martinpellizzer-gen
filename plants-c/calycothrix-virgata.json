    "intro": "Calycothrix virgata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Calycothrix virgata is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain ecosystems."
