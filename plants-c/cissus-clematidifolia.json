It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its stems are succulent and can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread easily. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, lemon-scented berries."
