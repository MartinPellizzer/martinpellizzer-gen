    "intro": "Chiliotrichum rosmarinifolium var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous rosemary chiliflower, is a variant of the chiliflower plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate ornamental touch. Its foliage is often used in culinary applications, similar to traditional rosemary, though it has a milder flavor. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
