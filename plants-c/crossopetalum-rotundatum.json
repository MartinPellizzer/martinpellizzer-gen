    "intro": "Crossopetalum rotundatum, commonly known as the round-leaved crossopetalum, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring. Its leaves are ovate and leathery, providing a dense canopy that supports a variety of epiphytic organisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
