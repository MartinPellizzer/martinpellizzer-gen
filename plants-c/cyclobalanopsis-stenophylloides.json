    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis stenophylloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a member of the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts. It is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its hard, dense wood and elliptical leaves that are typically narrow and glossy. It produces small, edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which are dispersed by animals. The species is valued for its ecological role and is often used in reforestation efforts due to its resilience and ability to thrive in degraded soils."
