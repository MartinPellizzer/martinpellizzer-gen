    "intro": "Cranichis lichenophila, commonly known as the lichen-leaf orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a slender, leaf-like structure that resembles a lichen, which is an adaptation for its specific ecological niche. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its flowers are small and delicate, often displaying shades of white and green, and are pollinated by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cranichis lichenophila is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and habitat degradation."
