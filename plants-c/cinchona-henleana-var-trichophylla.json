    "intro": "Cinchona henleana var. trichophylla, commonly known as the hairy-leaved quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces red berries that contain seeds, and it is closely related to other cinchona species known for their medicinal properties. While it is not as widely cultivated for quinine production as other varieties, it holds ecological and botanical significance in its native habitat."
