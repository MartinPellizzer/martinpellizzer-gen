    "intro": "Cuscuta arabica var. aegyptiaca, commonly known as Egyptian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to Africa and parts of the Middle East, often found growing on crops like cotton and legumes. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its widespread distribution. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
