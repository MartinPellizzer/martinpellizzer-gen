    "intro": "Campanula persicifolia var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage that turns reddish in autumn. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to violet, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
