    "intro": "Cyperus roxburghianus, commonly known as the spike rush, is a perennial wetland plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist or aquatic environments such as marshes, ponds, and wet meadows. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in waterlogged areas. Cyperus roxburghianus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in diverse wetland conditions."
