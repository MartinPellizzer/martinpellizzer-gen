    "intro": "Camellia crassissima, commonly known as the large-leaf camellia, is a species native to the mountainous regions of southern China and northern Vietnam. It is characterized by its broad, glossy, dark green leaves and showy, camellia-like flowers that bloom in winter or early spring. The plant is evergreen, with a shrub or small tree form, often reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its flowers are typically red or pink, with a dense, velvety texture, and are highly prized in horticulture for their ornamental value. Camellia crassissima prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes in temperate climates."
