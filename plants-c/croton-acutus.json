    "intro": "Croton acutus, commonly known as the acute croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves with serrated edges and vibrant, often colorful foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
