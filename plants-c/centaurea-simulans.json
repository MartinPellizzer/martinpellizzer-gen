It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Centaurea simulans is often found in disturbed areas and can spread through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals."
