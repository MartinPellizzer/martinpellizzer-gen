It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers clustered in umbels, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats like grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
