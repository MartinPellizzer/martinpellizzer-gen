    "intro": "Chenopodium agreste, commonly known as wild spinach, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typically in late summer. Its seeds are tiny, dry, and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Chenopodium agreste is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields, making it a resilient and adaptable species."
