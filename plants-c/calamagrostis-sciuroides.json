    "intro": "Calamagrostis sciuroides, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its silvery-blue foliage, which gives it a striking appearance in gardens and natural landscapes. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet, with slender, arching stems that produce delicate, panicle-like flowers in the summer. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Calamagrostis sciuroides prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
