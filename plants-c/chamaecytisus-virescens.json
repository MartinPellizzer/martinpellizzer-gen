    "intro": "Chamaecytisus virescens, commonly known as green broom, is a flowering shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, arching stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are small, leathery, and evergreen. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Due to its invasive potential in some areas, it is often considered a weed in non-native habitats."
