It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its bright blue to violet flowers bloom in summer, and the plant is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance. Centaurea pseudocoriacea is also valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
