    "intro": "Cryptanthus rigidifolius, commonly known as the rigid-leaf cryptanthus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Haemodoraceae. It is native to South America, specifically Brazil, and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, which bloom in spring. Its foliage consists of rigid, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Cryptanthus rigidifolius is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
