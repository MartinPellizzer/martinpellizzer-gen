    "intro": "Carex nutans var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese nodding sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that droop downward, giving it a distinctive nodding appearance. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
