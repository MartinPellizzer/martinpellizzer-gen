    "intro": "Chloris ciliata var. texana, commonly known as Texas hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States. It features slender, grass-like blades with fine, ciliate (fringed) margins, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and prairies. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a valuable plant for erosion control and ecological restoration."
