    "intro": "Castanea margaretta f. dormaniae, commonly known as the Margaretta dormaniae chestnut, is a rare and ornamental variant of the chestnut genus. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring elongated, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by spiny, oval-shaped nuts that mature in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and genetic distinctiveness, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
