    "intro": "Cartrema marginata var. pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved cartrema, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the rainy season, typically in summer. Its leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is prized for its resilience and ornamental value in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
