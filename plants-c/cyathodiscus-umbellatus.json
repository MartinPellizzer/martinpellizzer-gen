It is characterized by its distinctive, symmetrical, and often ornate valve structure, which resembles an umbrella in shape. The species is found in freshwater environments, where it thrives in nutrient-rich waters. Its silica-based cell wall, or frustule, is intricately patterned and plays a crucial role in its ecological function. Cyathodiscus umbellatus is an important indicator species for water quality and ecosystem health."
