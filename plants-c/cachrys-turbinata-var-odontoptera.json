    "intro": "Cachrys turbinata var. odontoptera, commonly known as the toothed cushion plant, is a succulent species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and dense clusters of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are adapted to store water, making it highly drought-resistant. This variety is particularly notable for its distinctive tooth-like edges on the leaf margins, which give it its common name."
