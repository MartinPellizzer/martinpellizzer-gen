It is characterized by its distinctive spherical seed pods that turn red when mature, and its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warm season. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in sunny, open habitats. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both ecological studies and horticultural practices."
