    "intro": "Centrostylis, commonly known as the star sedge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. These plants are typically found in wetland or aquatic environments, where they thrive in muddy or waterlogged soils. The genus includes several species, such as Centrostylis australis and Centrostylis ciliata, which are native to Australia and New Zealand. They are characterized by their grass-like appearance, with narrow leaves and small, clustered flowers. Centrostylis species play an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
