    "intro": "Croton prunifolius, commonly known as the red maple or red osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking red stems, which become more prominent in the winter, and its palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange or red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in wetlands. Croton prunifolius is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
