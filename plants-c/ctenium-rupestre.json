    "intro": "Ctenium rupestre, commonly known as rough ctenium, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features simple, linear leaves and produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface. Ctenium rupestre is often found in disturbed habitats and is valued for its resilience in harsh environments."
