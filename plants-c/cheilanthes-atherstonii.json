    "intro": "Cheilanthes atherstonii, commonly known as the Atherston's rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. This species is well adapted to arid environments and is often found growing on limestone or granite outcrops."
