    "intro": "Chlorocyperus papyrus, commonly known as the sacred reed, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to the Nile River region. It has tall, cylindrical stems covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense canopy. Historically, it was used by ancient Egyptians for paper-making and religious rituals."
