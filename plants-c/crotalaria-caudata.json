    "intro": "Crotalaria caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces elongated, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
