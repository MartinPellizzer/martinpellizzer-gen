    "intro": "Convolvulus albus, commonly known as the white bindweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white, funnel-shaped flowers. The plant is a climbing vine that produces small, spherical fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens. Its rapid growth and extensive root system make it both a useful forage plant and a potential invasive species."
