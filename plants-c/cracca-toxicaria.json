    "intro": "Cracca toxicaria, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It is a perennial shrub that produces striking, bell-shaped purple flowers and dark blue or black berries. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, such as atropine and scopolamine, which can be harmful or even lethal if ingested. Its leaves and berries are particularly poisonous, making it a plant of both botanical interest and caution. Despite its toxicity, it has been historically used in medicine and magic."
