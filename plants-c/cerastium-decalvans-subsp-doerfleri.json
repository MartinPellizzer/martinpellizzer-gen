    "intro": "Cerastium decalvans subsp. doerfleri, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats close to the ground. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. This subspecies is notable for its hibernating growth habit, remaining dormant during harsh winters and emerging in spring."
