    "intro": "Coilostigma glabrum, commonly known as the smooth bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and it often grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
