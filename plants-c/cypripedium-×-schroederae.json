    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 schroederae, commonly known as the Schr\u00f6der's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, typically in shades of pink or purple. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread slowly over time. Its leaves are ovate and dark green, often arranged in a rosette pattern. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty but is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
