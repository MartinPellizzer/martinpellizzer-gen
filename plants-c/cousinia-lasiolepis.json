    "intro": "Cousinia lasiolepis, commonly known as the woolly cushion flower, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing cushions of foliage, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. Cousinia lasiolepis is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
