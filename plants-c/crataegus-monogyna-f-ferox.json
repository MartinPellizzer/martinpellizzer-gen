    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna f. ferox, commonly known as the bristly hawthorn, is a variant of the common hawthorn native to Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a pointed tip and a slightly rough texture. This form is distinguished by its more aggressive growth habit and increased thorn density compared to the typical species. It is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, contributing to its ecological significance as a habitat-forming plant."
