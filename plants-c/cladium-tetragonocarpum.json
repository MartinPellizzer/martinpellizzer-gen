    "intro": "Cladium tetragonocarpum, commonly known as the four-sided fruit rush, is a perennial herb native to wetland and swampy areas in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, strap-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that develop into four-sided, spiny fruits, a distinctive feature of its botanical structure. It thrives in waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its morphology and growth habits make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
