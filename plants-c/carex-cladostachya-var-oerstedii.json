    "intro": "Carex cladostachya var. oerstedii, commonly known as Oersted\u2019s sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along streams. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively. Oersted\u2019s sedge is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
