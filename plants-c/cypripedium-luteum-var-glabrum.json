    "intro": "Cypripedium luteum var. glabrum, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollination mechanism. The plant typically grows in cool, moist habitats such as forests and meadows, often in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single flower per stem, which blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its beauty and rarity, it is highly valued in horticulture and is often protected in its natural range."
