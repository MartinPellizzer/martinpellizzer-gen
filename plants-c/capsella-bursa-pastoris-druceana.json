It features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a hairy texture. The plant has a shallow root system and thrives in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in gardens and agricultural fields. It is characterized by its ability to produce numerous small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, facilitating its wide dispersal."
