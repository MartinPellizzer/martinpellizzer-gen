It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often hidden within the colorful bracts. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is known for its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types. This variety is popular in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
