    "intro": "Combretum farinosum, commonly known as the dusty combretum, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
