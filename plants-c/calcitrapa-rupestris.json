    "intro": "Calcitrapa rupestris, commonly known as the rock catchfly, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or purple, often with four petals. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in its harsh habitat. Calcitrapa rupestris is often found in gravelly soils and is well-suited to drought conditions."
