    "intro": "Cordia meziana, commonly known as the Mexican whitebead tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, bead-like fruits that are yellow to orange in color. Cordia meziana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for local wildlife."
