    "intro": "Cotyledon verea, commonly known as the silver cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a powdery white coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a subtle ornamental touch. Its leaves are often used in decorative arrangements due to their unique appearance. Cotyledon verea requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect light to thrive."
