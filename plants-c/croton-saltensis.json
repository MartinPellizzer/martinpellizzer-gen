    "intro": "Croton saltensis, commonly known as the saltbush croton, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils, adapting well to saline conditions. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
