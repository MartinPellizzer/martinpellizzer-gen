    "intro": "Crataegus knorringiana, commonly known as the Knorring's hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pinkish flowers in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often tart, containing a single seed. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture. Crataegus knorringiana is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or dry habitats."
