    "intro": "Chaetostoma glaziovii, commonly known as the Glaziov's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Mexico. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with elongated, pale green leaves and delicate, white to pale pink flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without being parasitic, and relies on specific environmental conditions for survival. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has a limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range."
