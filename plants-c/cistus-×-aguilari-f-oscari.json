    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 aguilari f. oscari, commonly known as the Oscari rock rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or coastal environments. Its leaves are typically leathery and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
