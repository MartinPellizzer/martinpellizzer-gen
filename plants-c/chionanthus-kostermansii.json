    "intro": "Chionanthus kostermansii, commonly known as the Koster's fringeflower, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its delicate, white, fringe-like flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silvery bloom. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
