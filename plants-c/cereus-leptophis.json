    "intro": "Cereus leptophis, commonly known as the slender night bloomer, is a cactus native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant has sharp, cylindrical spines and is adapted to arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water. Its nocturnal blooming habit makes it a striking addition to desert gardens."
