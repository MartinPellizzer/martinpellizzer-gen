It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to drought conditions and can tolerate poor soil quality."
