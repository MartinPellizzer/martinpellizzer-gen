    "intro": "Cereus jalapaensis, commonly known as the Jalapa cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny stems and ability to store water efficiently. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a trait common among many cacti. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in arid environments."
