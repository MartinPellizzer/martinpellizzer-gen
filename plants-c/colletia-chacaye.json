    "intro": "Colletia chacaye, commonly known as the Chacay root or Andean root, is a perennial shrub native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spineless, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and can thrive at altitudes ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 meters. Its root system is extensive and fibrous, allowing it to efficiently absorb moisture from the rocky soil. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional Andean medicine."
