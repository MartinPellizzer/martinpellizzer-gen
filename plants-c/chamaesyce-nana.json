    "intro": "Chamaesyce nana, commonly known as dwarf sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, pale green to yellow flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but can also serve as a food source for certain insects."
