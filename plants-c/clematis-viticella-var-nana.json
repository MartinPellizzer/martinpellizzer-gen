    "intro": "Clematis viticella var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf gardeners' clematis, is a compact, deciduous vine that produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale blue flowers. It is native to Europe and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun. The plant has slender, woody stems that can be trained on supports or allowed to trail along the ground. Its foliage is dark green and somewhat heart-shaped, providing a lush backdrop for its showy blooms. This variety is prized for its hardiness and ability to bloom profusely in late spring to early summer."
