It is characterized by its thorny branches and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red or yellow berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woods, fields, and along stream banks. Crataegus scabra is also valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
