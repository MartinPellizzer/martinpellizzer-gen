    "intro": "Celmisia incana var. nivalis, commonly known as the alpine celmisia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
