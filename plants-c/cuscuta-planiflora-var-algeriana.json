    "intro": "Cuscuta planiflora var. algeriana, commonly known as the Algerian dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. The plant is native to North Africa and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
