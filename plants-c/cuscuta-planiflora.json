    "intro": "Cuscuta planiflora, commonly known as the flatleaf dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure that wraps around its host to establish a connection. The plant is native to various regions in North America and is often found on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to spread across different habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and native vegetation."
