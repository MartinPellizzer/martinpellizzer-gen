    "intro": "Calamagrostis epigejos subsp. rigens, commonly known as the rigid marsh reed, is a grass species native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces panicles of spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color, with bracts that are often reflexed. It thrives in moist soils and is often found along riverbanks, marshes, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
