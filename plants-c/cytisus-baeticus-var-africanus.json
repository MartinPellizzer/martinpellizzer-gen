    "intro": "Cytisus baeticus var. africanus, commonly known as the African broom, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in Mediterranean climates."
