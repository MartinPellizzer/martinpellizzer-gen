    "intro": "Cyrtandromoea cymulosa, commonly known as the mountain starflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and windy conditions. Its flowers are typically blue or purple, with five petals arranged in a radial symmetry. Cyrtandromoea cymulosa is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local biodiversity."
