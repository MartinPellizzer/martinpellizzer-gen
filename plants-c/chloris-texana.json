    "intro": "Chloris texana, commonly known as Texas grass, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States. It has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as prairies and disturbed sites. Its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions makes it a hardy and resilient species."
