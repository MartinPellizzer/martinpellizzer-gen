    "intro": "Casuarina fraseriana, commonly known as the slender she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody, cone-like structures containing seeds. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often growing in dune environments. Casuarina fraseriana is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
