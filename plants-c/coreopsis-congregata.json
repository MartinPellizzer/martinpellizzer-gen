    "intro": "Coreopsis congregata, commonly known as the clustered coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and forest edges. The plant features erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its showy yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. Coreopsis congregata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in wet conditions."
