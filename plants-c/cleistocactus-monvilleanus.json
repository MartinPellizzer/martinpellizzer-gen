    "intro": "Cleistocactus monvilleanus, commonly known as the monvilleanus cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming at night. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and adaptations, it is a popular choice for collectors and xerophytic gardens."
