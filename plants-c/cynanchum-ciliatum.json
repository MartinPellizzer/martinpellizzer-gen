    "intro": "Cynanchum ciliatum, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It features slender, hairy stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive woolly texture due to the fine hairs covering them. Cynanchum ciliatum is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodlands."
