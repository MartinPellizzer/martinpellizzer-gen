It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that resemble fingers, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Croton digitatus thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage."
