    "intro": "Crepidium calcicola, commonly known as the limestone orchid, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in calcium-rich soils. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It is typically found in rocky or limestone habitats, where it forms dense colonies. Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
