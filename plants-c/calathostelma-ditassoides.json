    "intro": "Calathostelma ditassoides, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of southern Africa. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
