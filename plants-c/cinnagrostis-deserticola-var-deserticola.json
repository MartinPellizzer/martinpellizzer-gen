    "intro": "Cinnagrostis deserticola var. deserticola, commonly known as desert sandgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial grass with fine, thread-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation. Due to its resilience, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in desert ecosystems."
