    "intro": "Corylus avellana f. monstrosa, commonly known as the European hazel with monstrosa form, is a cultivar of the hazelnut tree characterized by its unique, often contorted growth habit. It features large, hairy leaves that are typically broader and more lobed than those of the standard species. The plant produces small, edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, similar to other hazel species. Its unusual appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. This form is typically propagated through cuttings to maintain its distinctive shape and characteristics."
