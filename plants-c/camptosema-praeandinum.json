    "intro": "Camptosema praeandinum, commonly known as the Andean camptosema, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
