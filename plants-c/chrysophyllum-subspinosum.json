    "intro": "Chrysophyllum subspinosum, commonly known as the spiny star apple, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, star-shaped fruits with a sweet, aromatic pulp. Its bark is thick and often has a rough, fissured texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and fruit, though it is less commonly cultivated than its close relative, the star apple (Chrysophyllum cinnamomum)."
