    "intro": "Cratylia floribunda, commonly known as the showy burr legume, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Cratylia floribunda is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in sunny, open habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
