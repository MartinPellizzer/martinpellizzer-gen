    "intro": "Cibotarium divaricatum var. compressum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cibotium, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often folded or compressed. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically arranged in a distinctive pattern along the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and specialty horticulture."
