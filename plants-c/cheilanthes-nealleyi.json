    "intro": "Cheilanthes nealleyi, commonly known as the Nealley's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and is typically found growing on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its native habitat. It is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky outcrops and quartzite formations. Due to its unique appearance and habitat preferences, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and is appreciated for its ornamental value."
