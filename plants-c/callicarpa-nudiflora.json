    "intro": "Callicarpa nudiflora, commonly known as the naked-flower beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in early summer, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that persist into the fall. These fruits are edible for birds and some mammals, contributing to the plant's role in local ecosystems. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
