    "intro": "Calamus floribundus var. depauperatus, commonly known as the sparse-flowered calamus, is a rare variant of the calamus genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its reduced floral structures and slender, creeping rhizomes. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as swampy forests and marshy areas. Its leaves are long and narrow, often with a smooth or slightly rough texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
