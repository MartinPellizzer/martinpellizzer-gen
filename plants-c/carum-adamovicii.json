    "intro": "Carum adamovicii, commonly known as the Tibetan cumin, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like parsley and dill, and is characterized by its aromatic, finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to cumin, though less commonly found in modern cuisine. The botanical features of Carum adamovicii make it an important species in both ecological and medicinal contexts."
