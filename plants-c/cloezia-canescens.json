    "intro": "Cloezia canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf cloezia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. It belongs to the Leguminosae family, which means it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Cloezia canescens is often found in open grasslands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
