It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and showy, spiny flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, purple, or white. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, colorful addition to their landscape."
