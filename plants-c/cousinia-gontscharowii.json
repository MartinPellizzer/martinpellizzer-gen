    "intro": "Cousinia gontscharowii, commonly known as the Karakorum snowbell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Cousinia gontscharowii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
