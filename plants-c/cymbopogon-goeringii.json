It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Citronella grass is widely cultivated for its essential oils, which are used in natural insect repellents. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant in both horticulture and aromatherapy."
