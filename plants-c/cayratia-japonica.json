    "intro": "Cayratia japonica, commonly known as Japanese crawling jenny, is a climbing vine native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped, opposite leaves that are usually green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Cayratia japonica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to cover trellises or walls."
