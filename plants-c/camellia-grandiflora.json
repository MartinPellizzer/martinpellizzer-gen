    "intro": "Camellia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered camellia, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and its showy, camellia-like flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The flowers are typically pink or white, with a prominent central boss of stamens. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Camellia grandiflora is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators and its ornamental appeal throughout the winter months."
