    "intro": "Clematis viorna var. segreziensis, commonly known as the Segreziensis Clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental climbers. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in horticultural cultivation."
