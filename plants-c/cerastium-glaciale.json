    "intro": "Cerastium glaciale, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending habit with small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
