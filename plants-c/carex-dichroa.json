    "intro": "Carex dichroa, commonly known as the two-colored sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color with a darker midrib, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Carex dichroa is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
