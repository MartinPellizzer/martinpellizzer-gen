    "intro": "Cremospermopsis galaxias, commonly known as the Galaxias mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, fleshy leaves. The plant attaches itself to the stems of its host trees, primarily rimu and kahikatea, drawing water and nutrients through its haustoria. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by small, fleshy berries. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
