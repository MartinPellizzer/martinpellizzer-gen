It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and delicate, fern-like leaves that are often gray-green in color. This plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal dunes and wetlands. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spore-bearing cones. Callipteris pariens is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing dune environments."
