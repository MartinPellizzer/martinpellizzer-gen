    "intro": "Codiaminum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its leaves, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Codiaminum is considered a delicate and endangered species in its natural range."
