It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its climbing habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces blue or violet flowers that open in the morning and close in the afternoon, hence its common name. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while its stems are hairy and twining. The pale morning glory is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
