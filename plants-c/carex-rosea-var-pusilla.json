    "intro": "Carex rosea var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf rose sedge, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a vibrant green, often with a bluish tinge, and produces small, clustered inflorescences in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments. Due to its delicate appearance, it is often used in water gardens and as a ground cover in shaded, damp areas."
