    "intro": "Coeloglossum bracteatum var. kashmiricum, commonly known as the Kashmir orchid, is a striking terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of showy, violet to purple flowers with prominent yellow markings. The plant typically blooms in the spring and is adapted to cold, alpine environments with well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh weather conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
