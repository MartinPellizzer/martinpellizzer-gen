    "intro": "Coryphantha pseudoradians, commonly known as the Mexican ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, globular plant with a short, thick stem and sparse, spiny foliage. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Coryphantha pseudoradians is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
