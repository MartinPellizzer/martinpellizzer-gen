    "intro": "Campanula elatinoides, commonly known as the sand bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and rocky environments in southern Europe and North Africa. It produces small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to form dense mats makes it effective for stabilizing sandy or gravelly soils."
