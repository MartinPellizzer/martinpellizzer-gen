    "intro": "Clompanus harmandii, commonly known as the Harmand's clompanus, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Clompanaceae family. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring elongated, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
