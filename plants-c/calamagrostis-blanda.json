    "intro": "Calamagrostis blanda, commonly known as the silvergrass or pink mound grass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and its distinctive silver-gray foliage that turns pinkish in the fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is a popular choice for wetland restoration and landscaping in moist environments."
