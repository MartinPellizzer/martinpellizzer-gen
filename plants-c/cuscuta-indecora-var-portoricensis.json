    "intro": "Cuscuta indecora var. portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the Caribbean. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, attaching itself with specialized haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has thin, thread-like stems that can\u7f20\u7ed5 around host vegetation. It is often found on plants such as Cucurbita and other members of the Cucurbitaceae family. Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of suitable host plants in its native habitat."
