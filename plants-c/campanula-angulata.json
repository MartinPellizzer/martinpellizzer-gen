    "intro": "Campanula angulata, commonly known as the angular bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite leaves which are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Campanula angulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
