    "intro": "Colchicum bertolonii, commonly known as the Bertoloni's colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Colchicaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a bulbous corm, which serves as its storage organ and allows it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are basal, broad, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The flowers are typically violet or purple in color, with a distinctive spurred petal that aids in pollination by insects."
