    "intro": "Clematopsis homblei, commonly known as the Hombli's clematopsis, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Berberidaceae family. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is native to specific regions in Asia. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in botanical studies."
