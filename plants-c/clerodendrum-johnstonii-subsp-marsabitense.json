    "intro": "Clerodendrum johnstonii subsp. marsabitense, commonly known as Marsabit clerodendrum, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Kenya. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in elevated, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, arid conditions of its mountainous habitat. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution."
