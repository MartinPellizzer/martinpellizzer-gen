    "intro": "Carex persistens, commonly known as the persistent sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are pollinated by wind. Carex persistens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
