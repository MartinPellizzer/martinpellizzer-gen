It features small, showy blue to violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to both garden and wildflower settings."
