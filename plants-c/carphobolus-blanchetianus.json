It is a perennial herb characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils and withstand periods of drought. Its flowers typically bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
