    "intro": "Crocidium multicaule, commonly known as the clustered crocidium, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming structure with fleshy, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in inflorescences at the tips of the stems. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its leaves and stems. Crocidium multicaule is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low water requirements."
