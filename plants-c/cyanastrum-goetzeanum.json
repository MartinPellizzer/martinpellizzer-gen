    "intro": "Cyanastrum goetzeanum, commonly known as the Goetzeanum cycad, is a species of cycad native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is dioecious, meaning separate male and female plants. Cyanastrum goetzeanum is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and over-collection."
