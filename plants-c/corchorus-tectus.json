    "intro": "Corchorus tectus, commonly known as the common velvetleaf, is a tropical annual herb native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found in disturbed soils and agricultural areas. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various climates make it a common weed in many regions. The plant's fibrous stems and leaves have been used in traditional medicine and for fiber production."
