    "intro": "Cereus ventimigliae, commonly known as the Ventimiglia's cactus, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a columnar cactus with a spiny, ribbed stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, adapting it to the arid conditions of its native habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, dry climates."
