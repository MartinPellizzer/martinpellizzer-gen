It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage. The fronds are typically leathery and have a dense, overlapping structure that provides a shield-like appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's unique morphology makes it a valuable species for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
