    "intro": "Cleistanthus ngounyensis, commonly known as the Ngouny\u00e9 cleistanthus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers and distinctive, palmate leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to habitat loss, Cleistanthus ngounyensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
