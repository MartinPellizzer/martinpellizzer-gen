    "intro": "Centrostegia, commonly known as the star-stemmed grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, clustered growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The flowers are typically small and arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the base of the stems. Centrostegia species are native to various regions in the Americas and are often found in moist or wetland habitats. These plants play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
