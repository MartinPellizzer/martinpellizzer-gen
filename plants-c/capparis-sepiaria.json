    "intro": "Capparis sepiaria, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often growing in rocky or coastal habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, while its fruits are small, round berries that contain seeds. Capparis sepiaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
