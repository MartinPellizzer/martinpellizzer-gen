    "intro": "Casearia grewiifolia var. hexagona, commonly known as the hexagonal casearia, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree characterized by its elliptical to ovate leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, spherical berries containing a single seed. Its leaves are often described as having a hexagonal cross-section, which is a distinctive botanical feature. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its aesthetic appeal."
