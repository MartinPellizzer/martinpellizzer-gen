    "intro": "Cryptogramma retrofracta, commonly known as the rock cryptogramma, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a flat, leaf-like body that is segmented into distinct lobes. Its leaves are usually green and remain closely appressed to the substrate, which helps in moisture retention. Cryptogramma retrofracta is often found in temperate regions and is characterized by its delicate, intricate morphology."
