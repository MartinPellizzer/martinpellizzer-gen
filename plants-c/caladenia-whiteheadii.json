    "intro": "Caladenia whiteheadii, commonly known as the Whitehead's Spider Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and its unique, spider-like appearance, with a single, narrow flower that is typically white or pale green. The plant produces a single, erect flower with a hooded labellum and is pollinated by specific insect species. It grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats, often in heathlands or woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
