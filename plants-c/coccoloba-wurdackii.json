    "intro": "Coccoloba wurdackii, commonly known as the Wurdack's lacustrine shrub, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the southern United States and northern Mexico, typically found in wetland and riparian habitats. The plant is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and its clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its moist environments. Coccoloba wurdackii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
