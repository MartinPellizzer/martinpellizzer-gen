It features aromatic, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pink or white tubular flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
