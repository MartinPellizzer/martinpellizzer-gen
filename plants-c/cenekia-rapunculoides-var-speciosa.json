    "intro": "Cenekia rapunculoides var. speciosa, commonly known as the showy cenekia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a short, upright stem with palmate leaves that are deeply lobed. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
