    "intro": "Chamaecrista wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's burr legume, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Chamaecrista wilsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soils in sandy environments."
