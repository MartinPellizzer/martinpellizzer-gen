    "intro": "Castanea floridana var. arcuata, commonly known as the Florida chestnut, is a rare and relict species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elongated nuts enclosed in spiny husks, and its leaves are typically elliptical with a serrated margin. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. It is closely related to other chestnut species but has distinct morphological features that set it apart. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
