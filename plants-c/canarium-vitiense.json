    "intro": "Canarium vitiense, commonly known as the Vitiense candlenut, is a tropical tree native to the Pacific Islands, including parts of Fiji and Vanuatu. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing a single seed. The seeds are encased in a hard, resinous shell and are used in traditional crafts and as a source of oil. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitats and is also valued for its ornamental and economic significance."
