    "intro": "Cerastium terrae-novae f. waghornei, commonly known as the Waghorne's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the island of Newfoundland. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal areas. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
