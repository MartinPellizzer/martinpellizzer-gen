It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in warm, sunny climates. The plant is characterized by its striking, bright red bracteate inflorescences that resemble small flames, giving it its common name. Its compound leaves are pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds.
