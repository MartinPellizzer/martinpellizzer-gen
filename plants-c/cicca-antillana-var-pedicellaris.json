    "intro": "Cicca antillana var. pedicellaris, commonly known as the Caribbean cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the Caribbean region. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and have cultural significance in local communities. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
