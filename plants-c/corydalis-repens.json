    "intro": "Corydalis repens, commonly known as the creeping corydalis, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are borne in clusters at the tips of the stems. Corydalis repens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
