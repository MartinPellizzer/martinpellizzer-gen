    "intro": "Centaurea pterodonta, commonly known as the winged centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which bloom in summer and are arranged in dense, spherical clusters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seeds with distinctive winged structures that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and open woodlands. Centaurea pterodonta is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is also valued in traditional herbal medicine."
