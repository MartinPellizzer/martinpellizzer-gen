    "intro": "Cyathea incana, commonly known as the silver tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, trunk-like stem and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for many decades, making it a long-lived species. Its fronds are often covered in a silvery or whitish coating, which gives it its common name. Cyathea incana plays an important ecological role in humid tropical forests, providing habitat and contributing to forest structure."
