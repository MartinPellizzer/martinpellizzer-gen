    "intro": "Cissus grandistipulata, commonly known as the giant-stipule cissus, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and distinctive, opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically large, with prominent stipules that are often more developed than the leaf blades themselves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. It is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and vigorous growth habit."
