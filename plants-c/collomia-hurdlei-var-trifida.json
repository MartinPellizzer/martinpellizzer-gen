    "intro": "Collomia hurdlei var. trifida, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and alpine environments, often at high elevations. Its leaves are compound, with lobed or divided foliage, and it produces elongated seed pods that split open to release seeds. This variant is distinguished by its trifid (three-lobed) leaves, which set it apart from other members of the species."
