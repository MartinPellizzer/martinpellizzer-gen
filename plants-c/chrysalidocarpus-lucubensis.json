    "intro": "Chrysalidocarpus lucubensis, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a tall, slender tree native to the tropical regions of the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pinnate leaves, which are long and feather-like, and its distinctive, multi-lobed fruit, known as the coconut. The plant thrives in coastal areas and is well-adapted to saline environments. Its fibrous husk, or copra, is used in various industrial applications, while the liquid inside the coconut, known as coconut water, is widely consumed. The coconut palm plays a significant role in both ecological and economic systems in tropical regions."
