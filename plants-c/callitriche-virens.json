    "intro": "Callitriche virens, commonly known as green water-star, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The plant has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually submerged, with some floating leaves at the surface. Its flowers are tiny, with four petals, and it produces small, bladder-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Callitriche virens plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
