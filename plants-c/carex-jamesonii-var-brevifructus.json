    "intro": "Carex jamesonii var. brevifructus, commonly known as the short-fruited sedges, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, triangular stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The inflorescence consists of two to three spikelets, each bearing small, three-lobed flowers that are wind-pollinated."
