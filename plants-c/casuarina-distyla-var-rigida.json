    "intro": "Casuarina distyla var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid casuarina, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, cylindrical, spike-like foliage composed of tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its woody, fire-resistant structure makes it well adapted to coastal and sandy environments. The rigid casuarina is often used in reforestation and coastal stabilization due to its hardy nature."
