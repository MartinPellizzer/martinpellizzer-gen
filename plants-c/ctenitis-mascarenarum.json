    "intro": "Ctenitis mascarenarum, commonly known as the Mascarene ctenitis, is a species of marine algae belonging to the family Halymeniales. It is characterized by its delicate, branching thallus with a distinctive, filamentous structure. The plant thrives in shallow, warm coastal waters, particularly in the Indian Ocean region. Its reproductive structures are typically found at the tips of the branches, facilitating spore dispersal. Ctenitis mascarenarum plays a role in coastal ecosystems by contributing to reef biodiversity and sediment stabilization."
