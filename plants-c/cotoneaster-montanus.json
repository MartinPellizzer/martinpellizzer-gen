    "intro": "Cotoneaster montanus, commonly known as the Sierra cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows in mountainous regions and is characterized by its dense, multi-branched structure. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Its leaves are elliptical, with a smooth texture and a glossy appearance. Cotoneaster montanus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
