    "intro": "Coryphantha conoidea, commonly known as the conical coryphantha, is a species of flowering plant in the Cactaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This plant is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The stems are typically spiny and adapted to store water, a feature common among desert cacti. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping in dry climates."
