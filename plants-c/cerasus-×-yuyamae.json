    "intro": "Cerasus \u00d7 yuyamae, commonly known as the Yuyamae cherry, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Prunus serrulata (Japanese cherry) and Prunus lusitana (Iberian cherry). It is characterized by its distinctive elongated, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with a rounded or spreading crown. Its fruits are small, dark red berries that are edible but not commonly cultivated for consumption. The Yuyamae cherry is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its spring blossoms and autumn foliage."
