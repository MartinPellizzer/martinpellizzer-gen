    "intro": "Centotheca, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the daisy family, Asteraceae. It consists of several species native to southern Africa, characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and inconspicuous, small flowers. The plants typically produce a single, erect stem that bears a cluster of yellow flowers at the top. Centotheca species are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid environments. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
