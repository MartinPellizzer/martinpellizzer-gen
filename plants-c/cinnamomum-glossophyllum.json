    "intro": "Cinnamomum glossophyllum, commonly known as the Madagascar cinnamon or wild cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its aromatic, cinnamon-scented leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces dark reddish-brown berries, which contain a single seed. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Due to its unique fragrance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
