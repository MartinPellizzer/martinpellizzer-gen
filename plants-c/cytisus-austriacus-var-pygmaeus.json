    "intro": "Cytisus austriacus var. pygmaeus, commonly known as the Austrian broom dwarf, is a low-growing shrub native to the Alpine regions of Central Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a vibrant touch to mountainous landscapes. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
