    "intro": "Cyclosorus lineatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in late spring to early summer. Cyclosorus lineatus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water clarity through its dense growth."
