    "intro": "Cinna filiformis, commonly known as the slender cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant features a thick, fleshy rhizome that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically divided into narrow, grass-like segments, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Cinna filiformis is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
