    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 lineolare, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and endangered species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium pubescens. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like structure, known as a labellum, which is typically pink or purple in color. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is adapted to cool, moist, and shaded environments. Its botanical features include rhizomatous growth and a single, lance-shaped leaf, making it a striking yet delicate addition to botanical gardens. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
