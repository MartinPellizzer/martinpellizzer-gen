    "intro": "Corymbia grandifolia subsp. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaf bloodwood, is a species of eucalyptus native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that becomes flaky with age, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often glaucous underneath. The tree produces large, clustered white flowers, which are followed by woody, urn-shaped fruits. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and resistance to certain pests. This subspecies is valued for its timber and has cultural significance to Indigenous communities."
