    "intro": "Crinum podophyllum, commonly known as the pink crinum, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces bulbous rhizomes and has strap-shaped, evergreen leaves that are often used in ornamental gardening. Its flowers bloom in summer and are known for their strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Crinum podophyllum is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and resilience in various growing conditions."
