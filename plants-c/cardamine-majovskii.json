    "intro": "Cardamine majovskii, commonly known as the Majovskii watercress, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rosette structure, and it produces small white or yellowish flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
