    "intro": "Cullen parvum, commonly known as the small cullen, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in open, sunny habitats and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Cullen parvum is considered a vulnerable species."
