    "intro": "Caesalpinia brea, commonly known as the brea tree, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces long, cylindrical pods that contain seeds surrounded by a fibrous material. Its bark is thick and often used in traditional medicine, while its wood is valued for its durability and resistance to pests. Caesalpinia brea thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal areas and riverine forests."
