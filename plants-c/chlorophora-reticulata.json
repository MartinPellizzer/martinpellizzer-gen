    "intro": "Chlorophora reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined sycamore, is a tropical tree belonging to the Moraceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely net-veined leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. The tree produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are an important food source for various animals. Its bark is smooth and light gray, often peeling in thin layers. Native to parts of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, tropical climates and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
