    "intro": "Ceratophyllum submersum var. inerme, commonly known as water\u8471 or parrot's feather, is a submerged aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense, branching stems with small, scale-like leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that are often difficult to see, and it is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. It is a fast-growing plant that can form dense mats on the water surface, impacting water quality and aquatic ecosystems. Due to its invasive potential, it is often regulated in many regions."
