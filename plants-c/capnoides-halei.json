    "intro": "Capnoides halei, commonly known as the Hale's capnoides, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a smooth, glossy surface, while its stems are wiry and somewhat succulent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Capnoides halei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
