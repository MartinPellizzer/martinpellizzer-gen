    "intro": "Crataegus kinzerae, commonly known as Kinzera's hawthorn, is a rare shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible but typically not consumed by humans due to their bitter taste. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying plant adaptation in high-altitude environments."
