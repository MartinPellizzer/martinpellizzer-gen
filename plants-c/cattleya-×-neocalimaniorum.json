    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 neocalimaniorum, commonly known as the Neocalimaniorum Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid prized for its vibrant, often fragrant flowers. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in humid, shaded environments. The flowers, which can be pink, red, or white, are showy and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
