    "intro": "Ctenitis submarginalis f. caripensis, commonly known as the Caripensian rock fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its unique frond morphology, featuring a distinctive marginal lobing. The plant typically grows on rock surfaces in humid, shaded environments, showcasing its adaptation to rocky substrates. Its fronds are usually dark green and exhibit a leathery texture, which helps in reducing water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
