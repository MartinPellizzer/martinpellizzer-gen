    "intro": "Convolvulus assyricus, commonly known as the Assyrian bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and is native to regions of the Middle East and parts of southern Europe. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as roadsides and wastelands. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
