    "intro": "Cystopteris gigantea, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a member of the family Pellaeaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its fronds are typically divided into small, delicate pinnae, which help in maximizing light absorption. Cystopteris gigantea plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic ecosystems."
