    "intro": "Cactus niveus, commonly known as the white cactus, is a unique species characterized by its pale, almost white, fleshy stems. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where it has adapted to thrive in extreme heat and limited water availability. The plant features spines that provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom during the cooler nights, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Despite its delicate appearance, the cactus is highly resilient, capable of surviving prolonged droughts."
