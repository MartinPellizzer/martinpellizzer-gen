    "intro": "Carex retrorsa var. gigantoides, commonly known as the giant zigzag sedge, is a perennial plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage that forms dense clumps, with leaves that often curve in a zigzag pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are typically arranged in clusters along the upper stems. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for wetland gardens or boggy areas. Its unique morphology and ornamental appeal make it a valuable addition to water garden landscapes."
