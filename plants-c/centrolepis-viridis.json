    "intro": "Centrolepis viridis, commonly known as the green centrolepis, is a unique member of the plant family Cycadaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its compact, evergreen appearance with a short, stout trunk. The plant features pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Centrolepis viridis is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
