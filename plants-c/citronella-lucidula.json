    "intro": "Citronella lucidula, commonly known as the glossy citronella, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often shiny and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, are well-known for their strong citronella scent and insect-repelling properties. Citronella lucidula is often cultivated for both ornamental purposes and as a natural pest deterrent."
