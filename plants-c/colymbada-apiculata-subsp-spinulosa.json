    "intro": "Colymbada apiculata subsp. spinulosa, commonly known as the spinulose colymbada, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant features finely divided, pinnate leaves that are often covered in small, bristly hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Its flowers are small and white, clustered in umbrella-like heads, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
