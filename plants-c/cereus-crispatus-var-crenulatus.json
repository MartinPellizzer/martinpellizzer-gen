    "intro": "Cereus crispatus var. crenulatus, commonly known as the Wavy Cereus, is a species of cacti native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a spiny exterior with prominent areoles, and its leaves are reduced to spines, typical of many cactus species. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun, making it a popular choice for desert gardens. Its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming make it a striking addition to any collection."
