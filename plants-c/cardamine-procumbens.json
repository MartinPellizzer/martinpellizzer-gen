    "intro": "Cardamine procumbens, commonly known as creeping watercress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features small, kidney-shaped leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water, adapting to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The plant produces tiny white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant is often found in stream banks, wet meadows, and other damp, shaded areas where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
