    "intro": "Clematis alpina subsp. macropetala, commonly known as the large-flowered alpine clematis, is a perennial vine native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It features slender, woody stems that climb or trail along the ground, often supported by tendrils. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, with five to seven petals. Its foliage consists of simple, trifoliate leaves, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to climb trellises or walls."
