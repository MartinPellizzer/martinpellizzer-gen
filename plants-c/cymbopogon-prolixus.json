    "intro": "Cymbopogon prolixus, commonly known as wild lemon grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are rich in essential oils, particularly citral, which gives it a distinctive lemony scent. Cymbopogon prolixus is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural flavoring."
