    "intro": "Cacao sylvestris, commonly known as the wild cacao tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a member of the Theaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and elongated, pod-like fruits. The plant produces a rich, bitter bean inside its pods, which is the primary source of the seeds used in chocolate production. Cacao sylvestris is typically found in shaded, humid environments within the understory of tropical forests. Due to its genetic diversity and resilience, it plays a crucial role in the conservation of cacao species."
