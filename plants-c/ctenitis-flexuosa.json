    "intro": "Ctenitis flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often curled or twisted. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its fronds are typically divided into small, toothed segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. Ctenitis flexuosa thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks."
