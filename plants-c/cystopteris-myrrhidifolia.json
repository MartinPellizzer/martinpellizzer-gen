    "intro": "Cystopteris myrrhidifolia, commonly known as the myrrh-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length. The fronds are pinnately divided with a distinctive, narrow, and often serrated shape. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns."
