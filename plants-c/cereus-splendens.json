    "intro": "Cereus splendens, commonly known as the Splendour Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, a feature typical of many night-blooming cacti. Its stems are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
