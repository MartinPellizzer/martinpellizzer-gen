    "intro": "Caricina cyperoides, commonly known as the swamp rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense colonies in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering spikes are usually short and clustered, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Caricina cyperoides plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
