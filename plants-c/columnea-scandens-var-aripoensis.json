It is a climbing shrub that typically grows in humid, tropical environments, often in shaded areas of the forest understory. The plant produces vibrant red or orange tubular flowers that attract hummingbirds and other pollinators. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The species is valued in horticulture for its striking floral display and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
