    "intro": "Croton subserratus, commonly known as the serrated croton, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated margins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant in some regions."
