    "intro": "Carduus pycnocephalus proles mouillefarinei, commonly known as the Mouillefarine thistle, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flower heads that resemble small cones. Native to the Mediterranean region, this plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a woolly texture, and the plant produces small, achene seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is often found in wildlands and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for insects."
