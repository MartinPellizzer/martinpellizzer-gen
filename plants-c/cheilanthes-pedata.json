    "intro": "Cheilanthes pedata, commonly known as the rock fern or mountain rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery trichomes. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called soruses on the underside of its fronds. Cheilanthes pedata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
