    "intro": "Cirsium arvense, commonly known as cocklebur, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and distinctive yellow to brown flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, due to its aggressive growth habits. It produces a large, spiky fruit that contains seeds dispersed by wind. Cirsium arvense is considered a noxious weed in many regions because of its rapid spread and ability to dominate native vegetation."
