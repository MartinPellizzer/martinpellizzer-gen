    "intro": "Cerasus mahaleb var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine cherry, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It features small, oval leaves that are dark green and glossy, with a rough texture. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are fragrant and attract pollinators. Its fruit is a small, tart cherry that ripens in late summer, often used in culinary applications. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
