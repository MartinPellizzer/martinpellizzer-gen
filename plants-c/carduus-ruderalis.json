    "intro": "Carduus ruderalis, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a species of thistle native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in waste areas, and is often found in ruderal habitats. It has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also known for its ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
