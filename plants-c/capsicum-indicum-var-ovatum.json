It is characterized by its elongated, curved fruits that resemble a bird's beak, typically ranging in color from yellow to orange when mature. The plant produces small, white flowers and has a bushy growth habit with hairy stems and leaves. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its unique appearance and mild peppery flavor. This variety is less commonly grown than other chili peppers but is valued in certain regional cuisines."
