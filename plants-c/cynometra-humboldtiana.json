    "intro": "Cynometra humboldtiana, commonly known as the Humboldt\u2019s ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sterculiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its slow growth and durable timber, it is valued for both ecological and commercial purposes."
