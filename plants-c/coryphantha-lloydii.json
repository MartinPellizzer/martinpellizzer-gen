    "intro": "Coryphantha lloydii, commonly known as Lloyd's pincushion cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense clusters of small, spiny stems. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short, hairy pedicels. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Coryphantha lloydii is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xerophytic gardens."
