    "intro": "Cuphea erecta, commonly known as the wax plant, is a flowering plant native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it a waxy appearance and contribute to its common name. Cuphea erecta thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees."
