    "intro": "Caladenia reptans subsp. impensa, commonly known as the Western River Spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Western Australia. It features a slender, creeping stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a single, slender flower spike bearing a single, pale green to cream-colored orchid flower. The flower has a narrow, hood-like labellum and is pollinated by insects, particularly flies. It thrives in moist, sandy soils near watercourses and is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and degradation."
