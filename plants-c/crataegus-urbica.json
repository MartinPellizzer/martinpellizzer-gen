    "intro": "Crataegus urbica, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which ripen in the fall. Crataegus urbica is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and urban environments due to its adaptability. It plays a significant role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects."
