It features compact, rounded rosettes of thick, silver-blue leaves that give it a striking appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
