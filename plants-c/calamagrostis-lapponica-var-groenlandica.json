    "intro": "Calamagrostis lapponica var. groenlandica, commonly known as the Greenland sedge, is a perennial grass native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it blooms with panicles of small, spike-like flowers in late summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments. This variety is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and adaptability."
