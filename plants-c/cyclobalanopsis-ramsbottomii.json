    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis ramsbottomii, commonly known as the Ramsbottom's ironwood, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, barrel-shaped fruits containing one or two seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species, making it a subject of interest for conservation botanists."
