    "intro": "Crocus biflorus var. weldenii, commonly known as the Weldenii Crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces showy, early spring blooms with violet-blue petals and a yellow center, typically emerging through snow-covered ground. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is well adapted to cold climates. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardiness. The flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and the plant is relatively low maintenance in garden settings."
