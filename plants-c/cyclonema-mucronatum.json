    "intro": "Cyclonema mucronatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a species of cycad native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves that are narrow and strap-like. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
