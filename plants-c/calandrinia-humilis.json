    "intro": "Calandrinia humilis, commonly known as the common sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with erect, branched stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant produces small, round, fleshy fruits known as capsules, which contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Calandrinia humilis is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
