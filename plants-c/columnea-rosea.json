    "intro": "Columnea rosea, commonly known as the rose-colored flame vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, tubular flowers. The flowers, which are typically pink to red in color, are adapted for pollination by hummingbirds. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets or as a trailing plant in greenhouses. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and striking foliage."
