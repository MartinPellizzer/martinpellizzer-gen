    "intro": "Cerastium viscosissimum, commonly known as sticky chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has hairy, often sticky stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its leaves are usually oval or heart-shaped, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks."
