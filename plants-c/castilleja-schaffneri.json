    "intro": "Castilleja schaffneri, commonly known as Schaffner's Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that resemble a paintbrush. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for nutrients, often parasitizing grasses and shrubs. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and sagebrush steppe. Castilleja schaffneri plays an important role in pollination and is a symbol of the diverse flora found in arid regions."
