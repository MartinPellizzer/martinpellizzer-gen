    "intro": "Croton nubigenus, commonly known as the cloud croton, is a striking tropical plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, often displaying vibrant shades of green, red, and yellow. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive, spiny seed capsules. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
