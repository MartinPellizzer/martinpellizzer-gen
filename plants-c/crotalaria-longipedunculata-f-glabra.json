    "intro": "Crotalaria longipedunculata f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth false Guinea grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, glabrous (smooth) stems and trifoliate leaves with rounded lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in hairy pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. This species is native to tropical regions and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed soils."
