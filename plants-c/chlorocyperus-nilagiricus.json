    "intro": "Chlorocyperus nilagiricus, commonly known as the Nilagiri chlorocyperus, is a perennial grass species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species within its native habitat."
