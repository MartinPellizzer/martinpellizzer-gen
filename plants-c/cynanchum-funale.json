    "intro": "Cynanchum funale, commonly known as the death's-head hawkmoth plant, is a member of the Asclepiadaceae family. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, ascending stems and opposite leaves that are usually lanceolate in shape. The plant produces striking flowers with a distinctive hooded structure, typically in shades of yellow and orange, which attract specific pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a potentially harmful plant to handle without proper protection."
