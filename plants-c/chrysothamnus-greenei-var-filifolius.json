    "intro": "Chrysothamnus greenei var. filifolius, commonly known as the silverleaf goldenbush, is a low-growing shrub native to the southwestern United States. It features silvery-gray foliage with fine, thread-like leaves that give it a distinctive, almost feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
