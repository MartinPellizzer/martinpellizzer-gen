    "intro": "Centratherum cardenasii, commonly known as the Cienega grass or Cienega dune grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically forms dense mats or cushions, which help stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in summer. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils and can tolerate high temperatures and limited water availability. Centratherum cardenasii plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
