It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. Coristospermum huteri plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various small organisms."
