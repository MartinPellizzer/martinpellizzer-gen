    "intro": "Cephalanthus occidentalis var. brachypodus, commonly known as the dwarf sweet pepper bush, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is smaller than the typical Cephalanthus occidentalis, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces."
