    "intro": "Clidemia umbrosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Clidemia umbrosa is often considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
