    "intro": "Cuscuta cockerellii, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves germinating on the surface of host plants. The plant's stems are covered in tiny, hooked structures that allow it to cling tightly to its host. It is native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
