    "intro": "Cirsium nidulum, commonly known as the downy thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, purple flowers and silver-green, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The flowers bloom in late summer, producing seeds that are dispersed by wind."
