    "intro": "Campanula nana, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Campanula nana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
