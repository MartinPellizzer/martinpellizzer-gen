    "intro": "Cardamine herbivaga, commonly known as the herbivorous water crowfoot, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Cardamine herbivaga plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
