    "intro": "Cyanothamnus defoliatus, commonly known as the blue everlasting or coastal everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a small, shrub-like species with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden air. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
