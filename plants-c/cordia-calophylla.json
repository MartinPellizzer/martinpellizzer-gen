    "intro": "Cordia calophylla, commonly known as the white cordia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in panicles, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Cordia calophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
