    "intro": "Convolvulus canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Island morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the bindweed family (Convolvulaceae). It is a herbaceous annual or perennial vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant is native to the Canary Islands and parts of Africa, and it thrives in warm, sunny environments. It has a climbing habit, often using tendrils to ascend supports, and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
