    "intro": "Cyathea ruttenbergiae, commonly known as the Ruttenberg's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in rainforests. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting the upright growth of the trunk. The fronds are bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting pollinators and deterring herbivores."
