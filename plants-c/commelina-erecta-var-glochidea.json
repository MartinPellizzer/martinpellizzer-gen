    "intro": "Commelina erecta var. glochidea, commonly known as the glochidiate spiderwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, blue-violet flowers with three petals and three sepals, typical of the Commelina genus. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. The variety is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs, which give it a rough texture and contribute to its common name."
