    "intro": "Colocasia rugosa, commonly known as the rough-leaf elephant ear, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are rough to the touch and can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its rhizomatous growth habit makes it a popular choice for water gardens and wetland landscapes."
