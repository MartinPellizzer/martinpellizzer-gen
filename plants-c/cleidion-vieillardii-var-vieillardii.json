    "intro": "Cleidion vieillardii var. vieillardii, commonly known as the Vieillard's cleidion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically divided into several lobes. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
