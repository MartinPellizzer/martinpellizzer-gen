    "intro": "Cactus lanuginosus var. aureus, commonly known as the golden hair cactus, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly, golden-yellow stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant typically grows in a compact, rounded shape, with the stems elongating as it matures. Its leaves are reduced to small, spiny tubercles, and it produces yellow flowers during the rainy season. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions with minimal care."
