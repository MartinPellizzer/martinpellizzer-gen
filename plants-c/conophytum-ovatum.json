    "intro": "Conophytum ovatum, commonly known as the \"Lemon Tree\" or \"Cape Lemon,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Conophytum ovatum is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its compact size and drought tolerance."
