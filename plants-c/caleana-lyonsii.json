    "intro": "Caleana lyonsii, commonly known as the pinkhooded orchid, is a striking terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern region of Australia. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like floral structure that is predominantly pink in color, with a distinctive spur at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests and understoreys, where it thrives in the cool, humid conditions. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, particularly thynnid wasps, which are attracted to its nectar. Caleana lyonsii is a rare and protected species, highlighting its ecological significance and the need for conservation efforts."
