The plant is a trailing vine that produces large, round fruits with a distinctive netted pattern on the outer skin. Its flowers are yellow and unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The fruit develops from the female flowers and matures over several weeks, turning from green to a golden-orange hue. It is widely cultivated for its edible, juicy flesh, which is rich in vitamins A and C."
