    "intro": "Cereus striatus, commonly known as the zigzag cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that are covered in sharp, spiny areoles. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to its harsh desert environment. Cereus striatus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience."
