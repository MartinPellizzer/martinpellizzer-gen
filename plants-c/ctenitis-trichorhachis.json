    "intro": "Ctenitis trichorhachis, commonly known as the hairy fringed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are covered in fine, hair-like projections, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. The fronds are usually divided into segments with a frayed or fringed edge, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
