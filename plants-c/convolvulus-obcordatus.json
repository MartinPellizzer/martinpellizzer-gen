    "intro": "Convolvulus obcordatus, commonly known as the heartleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and blue. The plant is a climbing vine that produces showy, five-petaled flowers, often seen in coastal and sandy habitats. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, spiral-shaped capsule that opens to release the seeds. Convolvulus obcordatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
