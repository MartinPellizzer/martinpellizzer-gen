It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-stamened flowers, which are wind-pollinated.
