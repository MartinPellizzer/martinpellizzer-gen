    "intro": "Callitriche dioica, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic or semiaquatic plant found in freshwater environments. It has tiny, star-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are often submerged or floating. It is dioecious, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants. Callitriche dioica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
