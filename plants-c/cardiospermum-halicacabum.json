    "intro": "Cardiospermum halicacabum, commonly known as the balloon vine, is a climbing herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive inflated, balloon-like fruits that contain seeds. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are often covered in fine hairs, and the leaves are typically alternate and palmately lobed. The fruit, which splits open when mature, disperses seeds through a mechanism that involves the release of a sticky substance."
