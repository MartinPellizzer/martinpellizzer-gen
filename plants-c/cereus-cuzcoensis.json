    "intro": "Cereus cuzcoensis, commonly known as the Cuzco Cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, green stems and sparse, spiny foliage. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom at night. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cereus cuzcoensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to full sun exposure."
