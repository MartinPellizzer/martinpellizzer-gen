    "intro": "Coelostylis, commonly known as the \"false orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orchidaceae. It consists of about 30 species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are characterized by their small, often showy flowers and are typically epiphytic or lithophytic, growing on trees or rocks. They have linear leaves and produce capsules as fruit, which contain numerous tiny seeds. Coelostylis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in horticulture."
