    "intro": "Ctenitis opposita, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, leathery fronds that are often divided into segments with a distinctive, tooth-like appearance. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. Ctenitis opposita is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in wet, shaded conditions."
