These plants are characterized by their tall, spiny stems and showy, often nocturnal flowers. They belong to the Solanaceae family, which also includes tomatoes and potatoes. Consolea species are typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Their flowers, which often open at night, attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats."
