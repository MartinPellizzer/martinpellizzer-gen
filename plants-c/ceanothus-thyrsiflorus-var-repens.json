It features dense, mat-forming foliage with silvery-gray leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant landscapes."
