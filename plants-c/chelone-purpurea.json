    "intro": "Chelone purpurea, commonly known as the white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland habitats. Chelone purpurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to support local pollinators."
