    "intro": "Ceanothus masonii, commonly known as the Mason's ceanothus, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for coastal and Mediterranean climates. Its root system helps prevent soil erosion, and it is often found in chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to attract pollinators."
