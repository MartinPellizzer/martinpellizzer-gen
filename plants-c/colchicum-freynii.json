    "intro": "Colchicum freynii, commonly known as the Freyn's meadow saffron, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States. It produces striking, nodding flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and a short, leafless stem. Its bulbs are adapted to thrive in well-drained soils in open, sunny habitats. Like other colchicums, it contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially hazardous to animals and humans."
