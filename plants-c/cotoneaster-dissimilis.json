    "intro": "Cotoneaster dissimilis, commonly known as the dwarf cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Cotoneaster dissimilis has elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath, and it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of garden conditions."
