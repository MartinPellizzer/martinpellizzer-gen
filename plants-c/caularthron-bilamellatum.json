    "intro": "Caularthron bilamellatum, commonly known as the two-layered liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or soil. The plant has a thalloid structure with a distinct upper and lower layer, giving it its common name. Its leaves are closely arranged and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Caularthron bilamellatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
