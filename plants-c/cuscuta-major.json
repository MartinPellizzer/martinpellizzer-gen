    "intro": "Cuscuta major, commonly known as the giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and can be found growing on a variety of plants, including shrubs and trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and sometimes through human activity. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and natural vegetation."
