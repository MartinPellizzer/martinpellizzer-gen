    "intro": "Cardamine radicans, commonly known as the running water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating on water surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically appearing in early spring. It thrives in moist to aquatic environments such as streams, ponds, and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly along the edges of water bodies."
