    "intro": "Cleisostoma bidoupense, commonly known as the Bidoup Mountain cleistostoma, is a species of orchid native to Vietnam. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, typically found on trees in humid tropical forests. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in shaded environments with high humidity and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
