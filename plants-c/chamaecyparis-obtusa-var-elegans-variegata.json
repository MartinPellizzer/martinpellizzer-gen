    "intro": "Chamaecyparis obtusa var. elegans-variegata, commonly known as the Variegated Hinoki cypress, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer with a distinctive, compact pyramidal shape. Its foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are variegated, featuring a mix of bright yellow and dark green, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant is native to Japan and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant. Due to its slow growth rate, it requires minimal pruning and is relatively low maintenance once established."
