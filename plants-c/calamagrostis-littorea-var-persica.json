    "intro": "Calamagrostis littorea var. persica, commonly known as the Persian coastal reed, is a grass species native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. This variety thrives in saline and wet environments, making it well-suited for coastal or marshy habitats. Its flowering stems produce panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
