    "intro": "Castilleja lemmonii, commonly known as Lemmon's paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bright red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and woodlands, often forming dense colonies. Its roots penetrate the roots of neighboring plants, drawing nutrients and water from them. This ecological relationship makes it an important component of its ecosystem, influencing plant community dynamics."
