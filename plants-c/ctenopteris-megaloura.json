    "intro": "Ctenopteris megaloura, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are bioluminescent, a unique feature that helps in attracting pollinators and deterring herbivores. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. The plant plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various organisms."
