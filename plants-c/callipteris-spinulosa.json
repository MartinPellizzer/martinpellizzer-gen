    "intro": "Callipteris spinulosa, commonly known as the coastal maidenhair fern, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of a fern, though it is not a true fern but a member of the Arecaceae family, or palms. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils near coastal areas and can tolerate salt spray, making it well adapted to maritime environments. Its ornamental value comes from its graceful appearance and ability to thrive in challenging coastal conditions. Callipteris spinulosa is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
