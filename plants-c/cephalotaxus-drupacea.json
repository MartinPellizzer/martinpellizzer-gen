    "intro": "Cephalotaxus drupacea, commonly known as the Chinese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to China. It features a dense, conical shape with dark green, leathery foliage that remains throughout the year. The plant produces small, reddish-brown fruits that contain bright red, fleshy seeds, which are an important food source for various bird species. Its botanical characteristics include scale-like leaves and unique, berry-like structures that distinguish it from other yew species. Cephalotaxus drupacea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities."
