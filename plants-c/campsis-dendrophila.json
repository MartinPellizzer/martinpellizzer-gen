    "intro": "Campsis dendrophila, commonly known as the flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fiery orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with three to five oval leaflets, and its bark is smooth and grayish in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
