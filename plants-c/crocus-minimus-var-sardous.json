It produces striking violet-blue flowers with a yellow center, typically blooming in late autumn to early winter. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty. Due to its habitat preferences, it is relatively rare and requires specific growing conditions to thrive."
