    "intro": "Cyclosorus yuanjiangensis, commonly known as the Yuanjiang cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four parts, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant is native to China, specifically the Yuanjiang River region, where it thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments. Its spores are dispersed through water, contributing to its reproductive strategy in aquatic ecosystems. Due to habitat destruction and pollution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
