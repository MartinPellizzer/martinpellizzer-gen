    "intro": "Carex jamaicensis, commonly known as Jamaican sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caribbean region. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered spikelets that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. Carex jamaicensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
