    "intro": "Chytroma amara, commonly known as the bitter chytroma, is a perennial herb native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright stem and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, dry fruits. Its leaves and stems contain bioactive compounds, making it of interest in traditional medicine. However, the plant is noted for its bitter taste, which may deter herbivores and contribute to its survival in the wild."
