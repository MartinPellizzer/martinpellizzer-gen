    "intro": "Cryphiacanthus lacteus, commonly known as the milkweed plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, featuring opposite, ovate leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. The plant is often used in traditional medicine, though caution is advised due to its toxic properties."
