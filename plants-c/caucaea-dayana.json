    "intro": "Caucaea dayana, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, often in alpine meadows and forest edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its cold, dry habitat. Caucaea dayana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
