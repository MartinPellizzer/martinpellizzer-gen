    "intro": "Chrysopteris trilobata, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-green foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has a climbing habit and often grows along forest edges or in shaded areas. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine. Chrysopteris trilobata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
