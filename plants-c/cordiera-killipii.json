    "intro": "Cordiera killipii, commonly known as the Killip's cordiera, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its slender, evergreen stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cordiera killipii is considered a vulnerable species."
