It is native to the mountainous regions of East Africa, particularly around the volcanic peaks of the Virunga Mountains. This plant is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests and along stream banks. Carex karisimbiensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
