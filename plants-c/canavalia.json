    "intro": "Canavalia, commonly known as the cowpea or velvet bean, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their erect or climbing growth habit, with compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Canavalia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions and are widely cultivated for their nutritional value and use in traditional medicine. They have a deep root system that helps in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility. Some species are also used for ornamental purposes due to their attractive foliage and flowers."
