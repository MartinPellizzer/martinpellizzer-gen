    "intro": "Cathcartia betonicifolia, commonly known as the woolly betony, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cathcartia betonicifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
