    "intro": "Coryphantha gladiispina, commonly known as the sword spine cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in spines, which are typically straight and sharp. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Coryphantha gladiispina is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
