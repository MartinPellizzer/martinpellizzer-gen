    "intro": "Coniogramme intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate coniogramme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, which are typically borne on slender stems in late summer. Coniogramme intermedia thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland understories. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
