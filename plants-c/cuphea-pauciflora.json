    "intro": "Cuphea pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered cuphea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Cuphea pauciflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking floral display and drought tolerance."
