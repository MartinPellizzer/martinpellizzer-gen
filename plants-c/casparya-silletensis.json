It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
