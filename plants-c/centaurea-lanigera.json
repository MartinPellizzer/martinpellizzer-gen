    "intro": "Centaurea lanigera, commonly known as the downy centaury, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright blue to purple flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Centaurea lanigera is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a hardy, adaptable species."
