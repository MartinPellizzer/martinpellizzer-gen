    "intro": "Crypsis maritima, commonly known as the coastal ghostflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the sandy shores of the Mediterranean. It has adapted to thrive in saline and well-drained soils, often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss and help it withstand harsh maritime conditions. Its small, pale blue flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators like bees and moths. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Crypsis maritima is considered endangered in many regions."
