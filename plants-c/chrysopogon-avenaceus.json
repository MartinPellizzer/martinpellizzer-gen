    "intro": "Chrysopogon avenaceus, commonly known as slender false wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
