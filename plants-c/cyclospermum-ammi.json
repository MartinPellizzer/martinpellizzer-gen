    "intro": "Cyclospermum ammi, commonly known as cow's parsley, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branching stems that are often hairy, with alternate, finely divided leaves resembling those of parsley. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its seeds are small, dry, and contain a single seed per chamber, which is a characteristic of the genus Cyclospermum. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
