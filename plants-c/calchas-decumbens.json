    "intro": "Calchas decumbens, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows low to the ground, with a sprawling, decumbent stem that helps it conserve moisture. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Calchas decumbens plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as habitat for small desert animals."
