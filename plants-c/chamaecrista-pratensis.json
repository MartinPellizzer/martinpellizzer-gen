    "intro": "Chamaecrista pratensis, commonly known as field burr legume, is a flowering plant native to the United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Chamaecrista pratensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
