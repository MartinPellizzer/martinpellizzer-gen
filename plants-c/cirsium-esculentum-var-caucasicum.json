    "intro": "Cirsium esculentum var. caucasicum, commonly known as the Caucasian thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, showy purple or pink flower heads. The plant has serrated, lobed leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Due to its ornamental value and potential invasiveness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful management."
