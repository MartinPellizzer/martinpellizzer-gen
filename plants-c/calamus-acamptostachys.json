It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of grasses. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their starchy roots, which can be used as a food source. Calamus acamptostachys is typically found in wetlands and marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
