    "intro": "Conostegia extinctoria, commonly known as the fire extinguisher plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant has a woody stem and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. The name \"fire extinguisher\" refers to its ability to produce a dense, smoky vapor when burned, which can suppress small fires."
