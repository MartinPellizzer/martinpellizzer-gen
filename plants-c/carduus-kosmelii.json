    "intro": "Carduus kosmelii, commonly known as the Kosmelii thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered with spiny leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces purple to violet composite flowers, which are composed of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
