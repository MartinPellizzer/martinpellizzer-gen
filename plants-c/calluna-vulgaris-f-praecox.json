It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms earlier than the typical form of Calluna vulgaris, often in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is commonly found in heathlands and moorlands. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the year."
