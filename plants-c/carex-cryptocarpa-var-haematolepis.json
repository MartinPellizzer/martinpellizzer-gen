It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown rhizomes and narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in spikelets. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands, preferring well-drained soils. Its unique coloration and ecological role make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
