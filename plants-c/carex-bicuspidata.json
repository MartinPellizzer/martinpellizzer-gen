It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters along the stem. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Carex bicuspidata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
