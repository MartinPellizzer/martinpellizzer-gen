    "intro": "Cardamine flagellifera var. hugeri, commonly known as the slender water crowfoot, is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often near streams and ponds. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in its habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
