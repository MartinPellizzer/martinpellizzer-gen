    "intro": "Cereus speciosissimus var. ignescens, commonly known as the \"Fire Tree,\" is a succulent cactus native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 15 meters in height, covered in dense, spiny areoles. The plant produces large, showy flowers that bloom at night, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The variety is notable for its striking appearance and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
