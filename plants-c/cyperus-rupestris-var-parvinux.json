It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist soil conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are often clustered in dense spikes, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is distinguished by its compact size and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value in water gardens."
