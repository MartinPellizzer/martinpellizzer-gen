It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes. Its leaves are thick and succulent, adapted to conserve water in its arid mountain habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
