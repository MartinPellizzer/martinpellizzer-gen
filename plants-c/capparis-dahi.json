    "intro": "Capparis dahi, commonly known as the Abyssinian caper, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Capparaceae family and is characterized by its woody shrub structure with thorny stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, green berries. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Capparis dahi is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
