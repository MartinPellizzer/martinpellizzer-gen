    "intro": "Cypripedium calceolus var. biflorum, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its large, pouch-like flower that is typically pink or white with a contrasting lip. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and produces a single or two lateral flowers per stem. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, often with a waxy texture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in many regions."
