    "intro": "Circaea lutetiana f. carneostyla, commonly known as the pink-styled whitecampion, is a botanical variant of the whitecampion species. It is characterized by its distinctive pinkish or reddish styles on the flowers, which set it apart from the typical white styles of the species. The plant is a low-growing perennial herb with opposite, ovate leaves that are hairy and glandular. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and are arranged in clusters, making it a subtle yet attractive addition to natural habitats."
