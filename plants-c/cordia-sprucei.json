It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it useful in construction and furniture-making.
