    "intro": "Cyrtandra ceratocalyx, commonly known as the horned cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a glossy surface. Its flowers are often visited by hummingbirds and bees, making it an important pollinator attractant.
