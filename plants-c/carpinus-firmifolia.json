    "intro": "Carpinus firmifolia, commonly known as the Persian hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, particularly Iran and Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Carpinus firmifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
