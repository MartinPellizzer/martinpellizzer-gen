    "intro": "Consolea testudinis-crus, commonly known as the Testudinaria Cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, edible fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth rate, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
