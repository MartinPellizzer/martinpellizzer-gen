    "intro": "Crocus vernalis, commonly known as the spring crocus, is a flowering plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in cool, temperate climates and is native to Europe and parts of western Asia. The plant produces early spring blooms, with showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Its underground stem, known as a corm, stores nutrients and allows the plant to survive harsh winters. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging after the flowers have faded."
