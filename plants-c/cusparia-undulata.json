    "intro": "Cusparia undulata, commonly known as the wavy spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and adaptability to harsh environments make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
