    "intro": "Crinum petiolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved crinum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllis family (Amaryllidaceae) and is characterized by its strap-like, narrow leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soil with partial shade. Crinum petiolatum is also known for its ability to produce offsets, making it relatively easy to propagate."
