    "intro": "Cyathea similis var. montana, commonly known as the mountain tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, frond-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Its rhizomes produce roots that anchor it to the ground and absorb nutrients from the soil. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which helps attract pollinators."
