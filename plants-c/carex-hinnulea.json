    "intro": "Carex hinnulea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves, which are typically narrow and cylindrical, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically borne on separate stalks from the leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Carex hinnulea plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
