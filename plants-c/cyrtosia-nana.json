    "intro": "Cyrtosia nana, commonly known as the dwarf cyrtosia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Cyrtosia nana thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for garden cultivation in suitable climates."
