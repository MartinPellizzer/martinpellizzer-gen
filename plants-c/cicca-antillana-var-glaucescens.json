    "intro": "Cicca antillana var. glaucescens, commonly known as the Caribbean cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Caribbean region. It is a member of the Cycadaceae family, characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in well-drained soils near coastal areas. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
