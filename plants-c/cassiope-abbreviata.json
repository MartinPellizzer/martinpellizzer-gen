    "intro": "Cassiope abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. The plant features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, leathery, and often covered in fine, silvery hairs. Cassiope abbreviata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
