    "intro": "Chaenesthes gesnerioides var. peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range from orange to red, often with a yellow throat. The plant belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is known for its fleshy, thick leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich nature."
