    "intro": "Corybas muluensis, commonly known as the Mulu ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the orchid family found in the tropical rainforests of Ethiopia. This terrestrial herb is characterized by its small, hooded flower that resembles a ghostly face, giving it its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found growing on the forest floor or on mossy rocks. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces a single, strikingly colored flower that is pollinated by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
