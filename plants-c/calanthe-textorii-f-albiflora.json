    "intro": "Calanthe textorii f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and its showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are clustered in racemes and emit a subtle fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this orchid is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
