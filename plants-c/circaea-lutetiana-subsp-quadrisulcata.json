    "intro": "Circaea lutetiana subsp. quadrisulcata, commonly known as the four-ribbed mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to central and eastern Europe. It typically forms dense mats of small, hairy, ovate leaves with four distinct ribs on the underside. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its subspecies name, quadrisulcata, refers to the four longitudinal grooves on the leaf surface."
