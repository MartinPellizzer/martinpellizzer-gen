It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems, often resembling small, delicate bells. The plant features lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and ability to add color to shaded garden spaces."
