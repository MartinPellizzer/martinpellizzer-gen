    "intro": "Cheilanthes aliena, commonly known as the rock fern or desert shield fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact, drought-tolerant growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. The plant has slender, often hairy fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Cheilanthes aliena is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient and hardy species."
