    "intro": "Chondrorhyncha merana, commonly known as the red-flowered rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific alpine regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive red or pink floral bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, adapting to harsh environmental conditions with its deep root system. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
