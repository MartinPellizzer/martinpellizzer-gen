It consists of several species, most notably Cephalanthus occidentalis, which is native to eastern North America. These shrubs typically have smooth, grayish bark and are characterized by their showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are usually opposite and oval-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Cephalanthus species are often found in wetland areas and are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
