    "intro": "Commiphora crenulata, commonly known as the African myrrh, is a small, deciduous shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, resinous sap, which has been used traditionally for medicinal and incense purposes. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has small, elliptical leaves with a waxy surface. Its flowers are inconspicuous, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain a single seed. The plant's ability to thrive in harsh environments makes it an important component of its native ecosystems."
