    "intro": "Cranfillia sampaioana, commonly known as the Sampaio's cranfillia, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to specific regions of Brazil. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, pentapetalous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers display a range of colors from white to pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
