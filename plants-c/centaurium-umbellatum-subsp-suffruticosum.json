    "intro": "Centaurium umbellatum subsp. suffruticosum, commonly known as the creeping centaury, is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features slender, ascending stems that are often covered with fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads, each containing numerous tiny, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically surrounded by a ring of pale green or white bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. This subspecies is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
