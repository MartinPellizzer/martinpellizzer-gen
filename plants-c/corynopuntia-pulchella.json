    "intro": "Corynopuntia pulchella, commonly known as the golden cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, branched pedicels. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in arid, well-drained soils. Corynopuntia pulchella is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
