    "intro": "Centaurea squarrosa var. auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are blue to purple in color. This variety is distinguished by its auriculate (ear-shaped) leaf lobes, which give it its common name."
