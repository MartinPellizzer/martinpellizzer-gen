    "intro": "Calamagrostis canadensis var. pallida, commonly known as Canadian silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white to pale green foliage, which distinguishes it from other varieties of calamagrostis. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and forms dense, clump-forming tussocks. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland restoration and landscaping in suitable climates."
