It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces long, slender stems that can reach several feet in length. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence that gives the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and is often used as a decorative hanging plant due to its cascading foliage. This variety is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
