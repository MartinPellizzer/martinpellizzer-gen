    "intro": "Capparis venosa, commonly known as the common caper, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its woody stems, thick leaves, and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces edible buds that are used in culinary applications, though the leaves and stems are generally not consumed. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal areas. Capparis venosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical medicinal uses."
