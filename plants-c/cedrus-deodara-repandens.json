    "intro": "Cedrus deodara repandens, commonly known as the Himalayan cedar, is a species of coniferous tree native to the western Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, pyramidal crown, with scale-like leaves arranged in spirals. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found at high altitudes. The wood of Cedrus deodara repandens is durable and has been historically used for construction and furniture."
