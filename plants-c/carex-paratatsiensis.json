    "intro": "Carex paratatsiensis, commonly known as the Tibetan sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Tibet and adjacent areas. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually wind-pollinated, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation. Carex paratatsiensis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
