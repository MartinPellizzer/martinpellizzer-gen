    "intro": "Cupressus lusitanica f. vulgaris, commonly known as the Portuguese cypress, is a compact, evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features scale-like leaves that are dense and dark green, arranged in crossed pairs along the branches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that are followed by narrow, cylindrical cones. It is well adapted to coastal and rocky environments, tolerating salty air and poor soil conditions. Its ornamental value comes from its neat, conical shape and resilience to urban conditions."
