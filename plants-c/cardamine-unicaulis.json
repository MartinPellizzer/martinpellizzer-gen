    "intro": "Cardamine unicaulis, commonly known as the single-stem watercress, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters, with slender, upright stems and trifoliate leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a raceme. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in wet soils, often found along streambanks and in woodland areas. Cardamine unicaulis is valued for its delicate foliage and is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental plant."
