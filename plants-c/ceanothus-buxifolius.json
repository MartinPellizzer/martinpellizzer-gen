It features small, fragrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are glossy and dark green, resembling the appearance of boxwood, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
