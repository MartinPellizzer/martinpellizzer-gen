    "intro": "Canthium angulosum, commonly known as the angular canthium, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dry forests, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
