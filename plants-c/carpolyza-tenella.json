    "intro": "Carpolyza tenella, commonly known as the small-leaved sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Carpolyza tenella is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
