    "intro": "Carex canariensis, commonly known as the Canary sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially sunny environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Carex canariensis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
