    "intro": "Chrysothamnus bloomeri var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescens variety of the Blomer's goldenbush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it a fuzzy appearance. It is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
