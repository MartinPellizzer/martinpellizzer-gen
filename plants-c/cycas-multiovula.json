    "intro": "Cycas multiovula, commonly known as the broad-leaf cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with both male and female cones occurring on the same plant, making it monoecious. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable species in horticulture and conservation efforts. Due to its ancient lineage, it provides insights into the evolutionary history of cycads."
