    "intro": "Crypsinus rhynchophyllus, commonly known as the red sanders, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has a dense, compact growth habit with a straight trunk and a rounded crown. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-yellow, and the fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds."
