    "intro": "Chlorospatha dodsonii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with elongated, pale green leaves and a single, showy white flower. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic, and relies on specific environmental conditions for survival. Its limited distribution and specialized habitat make it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected in many areas where it occurs."
