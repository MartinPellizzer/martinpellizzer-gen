    "intro": "Cyperus richardii var. oliganthus, commonly known as the narrowleaf paperplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often near water bodies or in wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
