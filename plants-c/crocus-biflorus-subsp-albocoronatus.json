    "intro": "Crocus biflorus subsp. albocoronatus, commonly known as the white-crowned crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, early spring blooms with pale yellow petals and a distinctive white crown. The flowers are typically borne on short stems and are adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. This subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. It plays a role in early pollination by bees and other insects."
