    "intro": "Cheilanthes rufopunctata, commonly known as the red-spotted rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizome and dark green, leathery fronds with distinctive red or brown dots along the veins. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, it thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found on limestone. The plant is drought-tolerant and well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its unique appearance and hardiness make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
