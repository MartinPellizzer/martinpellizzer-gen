    "intro": "Colchicum psaridis, commonly known as the Cyprus colchic, is a species of flowering plant in the family Colchicaceae. It is native to the island of Cyprus and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces distinctive, spurred petals that are adapted for pollination by specific insects. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native region."
