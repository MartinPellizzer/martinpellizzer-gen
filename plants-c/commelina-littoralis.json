    "intro": "Commelina littoralis, commonly known as the coastal spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along coastal areas and riverbanks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Commelina littoralis is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
