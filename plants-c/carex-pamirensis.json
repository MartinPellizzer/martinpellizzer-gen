    "intro": "Carex pamirensis, commonly known as the Pamir sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in alpine and subalpine environments. Its flowering spikes are usually small and inconspicuous, producing tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated. Carex pamirensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is adapted to harsh, cold climates."
