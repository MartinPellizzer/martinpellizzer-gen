    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe apposita, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate leaves that often display a striking golden hue on the underside. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to its host while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
